VMS logical names
=======

All the LAMPS system-wide logical names are defined at VMS startup time by
a set of scripts that live in LSL$STARTUP: These are generated by the
software install procedure, using the templates that are in 
LSL$SOURCE_ROOT:[LSLSYSTEM.EXAMPLES.STARTUP], particularly the ones that
start LSDEFNS.

LSLSYSTEM/COM/LSLINSTALL.COM does reference the startup directory.
