2 ROVER

  FORMAT:		$ ROVER

  Parameters:	None, ROVER utility is command driven.

  ROVER displays both grid based and vector geographic data, and
  allows a user to interact with the displayed information. It
  forms part of the Laser-Scan TVES Package. 

  The grid and vector data may be displayed independently, but more
  importantly they may also be displayed together using the
  program. The user is able to derive considerable benefits from
  this integrated display: 

     o in the areas of data validation and visualisation 
     o through the derivation of other geographic information from 
       the combined datasets.

  Three modes of operation are available in ROVER:

    o  Normal Display Mode.
    o  Vector Digitising Mode.
    o  Raster Editing Mode
    o  Registration Mode


3 ABANDON

  FORMAT:		ABANDON

  In the DIGITISE mode the ABANDON  command abandons the
  construction of a feature. 

  In EDIT mode ABANDON cancels the current raster editing
  sequence. The command is only available in EDIT or DIGITISE
  modes of operation. ABANDON is defined as puck button F. In
  EDIT mode typing <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl and Z keys
  together) also produces the effect of an ABANDON command. 

3 AREA_EDIT

  FORMAT:		AREA_EDIT

  The AREA_EDIT command starts an area editing operation. A
  subsequent sequence of EDIT and MOVE commands are used to
  define the perimeter of the area to be edited. The END
  command completes the operation and the specified DTI value
  is assigned to pixels which lie within the area. 

  The command is only available in EDIT mode of operation.

  To indicate that area editing is taking place the program prompt 
  becomes 'Area>' while the area is being defined.
  ABANDON or <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl and Z keys together) may be 
  used to abort an AREA editing operation. 
  Puck button C is defined to be AREA_EDIT.

3 CENTRE

  FORMAT:		CENTRE  xcoord, ycoord 

  Parameters:	xcoord, ycoord
  The matrix coordinates specified as a column and row value. 2 integer 
  values are required.

  The displayed image is centred around the screen position
  corresponding to the supplied matrix x y coordinate point provided
  they lie within the geographical bounds of the file. 

  If a source document has been registered to the current DTI using the
  SETUP MAP command, CENTRE may be given using Puck Button 1. 
  This command has effect only on a graphics device which supports
  hardware pixel replication. 


3 CLEAR	

  FORMAT:		CLEAR qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:
  LABEL, PICTURE, QUADRANT

  This command, when issued with no qualifiers, clears the entire
  screen of both raster and vector information. In EDIT mode
  the effect of clearing will result in cursor movement in the
  previously displayed area "repainting" the image. It is therefore
  recommended that a DISPLAY command should be issued before the
  cursor is moved. 

4	LABEL

  FORMAT:		CLEAR LABEL

  User annotation which has been specified with the DRAW LABEL
  command is cleared from the screen. 

  Note that because annotation is held in picture 2, any overlaid
  vector information is also cleared using this command. 

4 PICTURE

  FORMAT:		CLEAR PICTURE picture-number

  Parameter:	picture-number
  The picture that is to be cleared. An integer value in the range
  1 to 2 is required. 
  
  The CLEAR PICTURE command is used to clear either picture 1 or
  picture 2. 

  The number of bit-planes allocated to picture 1 and picture 2 is
  determined using the PLANES command. By default 5 planes
  (bit-planes 1 to 5) are used for Picture 1, and the remaining 3
  planes (bit-planes 6 to 8) are used for Picture 2.  An raster DTI
  image is drawn into Picture 1, while any vector overlay
  information or annotation drawn using the OVERLAY and DRAW LABEL
  commands, is displayed in Picture 2. 

  A raster image may therefore be cleared independently of any
  overlay using the command CLEAR PICTURE 1, while any overlay may
  be cleared independently from the raster base using the command
  CLEAR PICTURE 2. To clear both pictures (ie. all bit-planes of a
  graphics display), the command CLEAR should be used. 

  The CLEAR PICTURE erases the information held in the memory of
  the graphics device and hence further DISPLAY or OVERLAY commands
  are required to produce once again an image on the screen. Note
  that ENABLE/DISABLE PICTURE commands allow instantaneous
  selection and deselection of raster and vector information
  already produced with the DISPLAY or OVERLAY commands. 

4  QUADRANT

  FORMAT:		CLEAR QUADRANT quadrant [1..4]
  
  Parameters:	quadrant number(s)
  Up to 4 integer quadrant numbers may be specified
  The quadrant numbers are defined as follows.

    Quadrant 1    Top Left Quadrant
    Quadrant 2    Top Right Quadrant
    Quadrant 3    Bottom Right Quadrant
    Quadrant 4    Bottom Left Quadrant

  This command clears both picture 1 (raster) and picture 2
  (vector) in the specified quadrant. More than one quadrant may be
  specified for clearing simultaneously. 

  The command is only valid if quartered screen mode has been
  enabled with the ENABLE DIVIDE command. 

3	CLOSE

  FORMAT:		CLOSE qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:
  FILEIN, IFF, OUTPUT, RCP_FILE

4  FILEIN

  FORMAT:		CLOSE FILEIN DTI_number[s]
			CLOSE FILEIN   ALL

  Parameters:	DTI_numbers
  A list of up to 4 DTI file numbers to which the open DTI files
  have been  assigned. The values should be in the range 1 to 4.
  Alternatively the ALL qualifier may be specified. 

  This command is used to close one or more DTI files which may be
  open.  As only four files may be open, the parameters should be
  in the range 1 to 4, while CLOSE FILEIN  ALL will close all
  currently open DTI files. 

4  IFF

  FORMAT:		CLOSE IFF

  The input IFF file holding vector information is closed. This
  command is required before another IFF file may be opened. 

4  OUTPUT

  FORMAT:		CLOSE OUTPUT

  The output IFF file which has been previously opened to receive
  digitised coordinates is closed. 

4  RCP_FILE

  FORMAT:		CLOSE RCP_FILE number
                        CLOSE RCP_FILE ALL
   
  Parameter:    number
  A list of up to 4 integer RCP file numbers. The values
  should be in the range 1 to 4. Alternatively the ALL
  qualifier may be specified. 

  Closes a Registration Control Point (RCP) file.
  The command CLOSE RCP_FILE is only available in registration 
  mode. 

3  COLOURS

  FORMAT:		COLOURS num_colours

  Parameter:	num_colours
  The number of colours used for raster display. This should be a
  positive integer in the range 1 to 2 raised to the power of n - 3
  where n is  the current planes setting. 
  By default the number of display colours is the maximum number of
  colours available with the current PLANES setting. 

  The number of colours that will be used for the display of the
  raster image for the currently selected DTI file is specified by
  this command. The number of colours which may be specified
  depends on the current PLANES setting. If, for example, the
  PLANES setting is 5 then up to 29 colours may be specified.
  Colour indices  1 and 2 are reserved for black and white and a
  further colour (the first colour as specified by the
  FIRST_COLOUR command) is reserved for the display of zero values
  in the input matrix (normally blue for digital elevation models).

  This command can be used in conjunction with the FIRST_COLOUR
  command  to enable different DTI files to be displayed using
  different parts of the  colour table. Thus a colour image may be
  displayed alongside a grey scale image. 

  Note that redefining the number of colours, may change the
  step value interval value previously set by the STEP
  command, and that the PLANES command will reset the number of
  colours to the maximum allowable for that bit-plane setting. 

  In EDIT mode of operation this command causes automatic redisplay
  of the currently selected DTI file. 

3  CONTINUE

  FORMAT:		CONTINUE

  CONTINUE is used to resume the execution of a Rover Command File
  which has been specified with the @ command. 
  The command is only valid when the command file has passed
  control back to the terminal with a RESPOND command. 

3 CREATE 

  Valid qualifier is
  RCP_FILE

4 RCP_FILE


  FORMAT:	        CREATE RCP_FILE file-spec

  Parameter:     file-spec
  The RCP file specification. Any part of the file
  specification not supplied will be taken from the default
  'LSL$RCP:RCP.RCP'. 

  The CREATE RCP_FILE command is used to create a new
  Registration Control Point file. 

  Up to 4 RCP files may be created.  The SELECT RCP command
  controls which RCP file is current.  By default, the current
  file is the most recent RCP file to be created. 

  Entries may be added to the current file using the RCP ADD
  command. 

3 DESELECT 

  FORMAT:		DESELECT qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:

4  FC

  FORMAT:         DESELECT FC feature_code [,...]

  Parameters:	feature_code
  An integer feature code in the range 0 to 32767. Multiple feature
  codes may be specified separated by commas or spaces, while a
  range of feature codes may be specified by means of a '-'. eg.
  DESELECT FC 10-13 excludes feature codes 10,11,12 and 13. 
  Alternatively a valid FRT group name may be specified. 

  The DESELECT FC command is used to exclude IFF features from
  vector overlay. 
  Features are excluded on the basis of their feature code.
  By default ROVER will use all features within an IFF file. 
  Use of the SHOW SELECTIONS command is recommended to display
  feature selections before the OVERLAY command is given. 
  The DESELECT FC command is only valid if an FRT command has been
  used to select a Feature Representation Table. 

4  FSN

   FORMAT:         DESELECT FSN fsn [,...]

  Parameters:	fsn
  An integer feature code in the range 0 to 65534. Multiple feature
  serial numbers may be specified separated by commas or spaces,
  while a range of numbers may be specified by means of a '-'. eg.
  DESELECT FSN 10-13 excludes feature serial numbers 10,11,12 and
  13. 
  The DESELECT FSN  command is used to exclude IFF features from
  vector overlay. Features are excluded on the basis of their
  feature serial number. 
  By default ROVER will use all features within an IFF file. 
  Use of the SHOW SELECTIONS command is recommended to display
  feature selections before the OVERLAY command is given. 
  The DESELECT FSN command is only valid if an FRT file has been
  specified. 

4  LAYER

  FORMAT:         DESELECT LAYER layer [,...]
	
  Parameter:	layer

  An integer layer number in the range 0 to 32767. Multiple layer
  numbers may be specified separated by commas or spaces, while a
  range of layer numbers may be specified by means of a '-'. eg.
  DESELECT LAYER 10-13 excludes all features in layers 10,11,12 and
  13. 

  The DESELECT LAYER command is used to exclude IFF features from
  vector overlay. 
  Features are excluded on the basis of IFF layer.
  By default ROVER will use all features within an IFF file. 
  Use of the SHOW SELECTIONS command is recommended to
  display feature selections before the OVERLAY command is given. 
  The DESELECT LAYER command is only valid if an FRT file has been
  specified. 

3  DISABLE

  FORMAT:		DISABLE

  Valid qualifiers are:
  ABSOLUTE, COLOUR_MAP, CROSS_CURSOR, DEFAULT, DIGITISE, DIVIDE, EDIT, 
  FLOODING, HATCH, HEIGHT, INTERPOLATION, LEGEND, MASK, OVERRIDE, 
  PATTERN, PICTURE, POSITIONING, REGISTRATION, SAMPLE, TABLE, TEXT


4  ABSOLUTE

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE ABSOLUTE

  DISABLE ABSOLUTE cancels a previous ENABLE ABSOLUTE
  command. If DISABLE ABSOLUTE is given, then coordinate values
  required by the WINDOW and  MOVE, commands supplied in metre or
  projection units, must be specified as an offset from the SW
  corner of the matrix.	Coordinates supplied with the IFFWINDOW
  command should similarly be specified as an offset from the SW
  corner of the IFF file area. 

  By default window values should be specified as absolute
  coordinates. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 
	

4  COLOUR_MAP

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE COLOUR_MAP

  DISABLE COLOUR_MAP disables the use of a temporary mapped file
  used to make frequent redisplay, windowing and zooming more
  efficient. The command therefore cancels the effect of any
  previous ENABLE COLOUR_MAP command. 
  By default no temporary mapped file is used.
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 

4  CROSS_CURSOR

  FORMAT:		DISABLE CROSS_CURSOR

  DISABLE CROSS_CURSOR disables the use of a vector cross cursor
  during raster editing  and reselects the square DTI-pixel sized
  cursor. The command therefore cancels the effect of a previous
  ENABLE CROSS_CURSOR command. 

  By default the square DTI-pixel sized cursor is used.
  This command is only available in EDIT mode of operation. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 
  Puck button 7 alternately ENABLEs and DISABLEs CROSS_CURSOR.

4 DEFAULT

  FORMAT:        DISABLE DEFAULT rcp_qualifier
  Parameter:     rcp_qualifier
  The name of a Registration Control Point attribute, chosen from:

      ALL       All RCP attributes
      RCP_ID    The RCP identifier
      RCP_TYPE  The RCP type identifier. 
      RCP_WXY   The RCP XY coordinate weighting value
      RCP_WZ    The RCP Z coordinate weighting value
      RCP_Z     The RCP Z coordinate value

  The DISABLE/ENABLE DEFAULT RCP command controls for what
  information the user is prompted, when the RCP ADD command is
  given. 

  If DISABLE DEFAULT is specified then the user is prompted for the
  specified RCP attribute. For example, if the command DISABLE
  DEFAULT RCP_ID has been given, the user is prompted to enter an
  RCP identifier. The SET DEFAULT RCP commands control the default
  value that is supplied with a prompt, and which may be accepted
  using carriage return. By default no prompting for additional RCP
  information occurs, and the RCP fields are assigned their default
  values. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  options when in Registration mode. 

4  DIGITISE

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE DIGITISE

  DISABLE DIGITISE ends the digitising mode of operation. The
  program returns to the main  display mode, and the 'Rover>'
  prompt returns. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 

4  DIVIDE

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE DIVIDE

  DISABLE DIVIDE deselects the divided screen display. Subsequent
  display commands operate on the full screen display. The command
  therefore cancels the effect of any previous ENABLE DIVIDE
  command. 
  In EDIT mode the command causes automatic redisplay of the
  currently selected DTI file. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  EDIT

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE EDIT

  DISABLE EDIT ends the editing mode of operation. The program
  returns to the main  Display mode, and the 'Rover>' prompt
  returns. 
  The editing status lines at the bottom of the display are
  replaced by the border text if the TEXT option is enabled. An
  implicit RESET_MINMAX command is also applied to update the
  value ranges  stored in the header of any edited files which have
  been opened for write access with the UPDATE_FILEIN command. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  FLOODING

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE FLOODING

  DISABLE FLOODING ends interactive flooding using the mouse,
  trackerball or table. The current flood level is,  however,
  remembered if a subsequent ENABLE FLOODING command is given. 
  Interactive flooding is only available in EDIT mode of
  operation. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 
  Puck button E alternately disables and enables flooding.

4  HATCH

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE HATCH

  DISABLE HATCH returns to the default mode of using hatching
  parameters specified in the FRT file for overlay. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  HEIGHT

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE HEIGHT

  DISABLE HEIGHT returns to the default mode of operation where
  text heights are taken from the FRT file for vector overlay. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  INTERPOLATION

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE INTERPOLATION

  DISABLE INTERPOLATION deselects curve Interpolation of graphical
  type 6 features output with the OVERLAY command. 
  By default no curve interpolation takes place.
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  LEGEND

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE LEGEND

  DISABLE LEGEND disables the display of a colour/value guide and
  an overlay colour guide when a DISPLAY command is  given. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  MASK

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE MASK

  DISABLE MASK deselects the option to draw vectors in PICTURE 1. 
  Subsequent vectors are drawn in PICTURE 2 when the OVERLAY
  command is given. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  OVERRIDE

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE OVERRIDE

  DISABLE OVERRIDE cancels feature codes set by the ENABLE OVERRIDE
  command. The actual feature codes in the file will be used to
  determine their representation on the screen when output with the
  OVERLAY command. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 
 
4  PATTERN

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE PATTERN

  DISABLE PATTERN suppresses the the drawing of patterned lines.
  Lines specified as patterned in the FRT file will be drawn as
  solid when the OVERLAY command is issued. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  PICTURE

  FORMAT:		 DISABLE PICTURE picnum     

  Parameter:	 picnum
  The picture number. An integer value in the range 1 to 2
  is required. 

  Picture 1 contains the raster information output using the
  DISPLAY command. 
  Picture 2 contains any vector information drawn using the OVERLAY
  command, and any user annotation drawn using the DRAW LABEL
  command. 

  DISABLE PICTURE makes the specified picture 'invisible'. The
  image may be made visible again with the ENABLE PICTURE command.
  (cf CLEAR PICTURE). 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the 2
  pictures. 

4  POSITIONING

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE POSITIONING

  DISABLE POSITIONING disables the use of the justification code
  (0-8) stored in the FS entry for text positioning. The text is
  positioned by its lower left corner. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

4  REGISTRATION

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE REGISTRATION

  The DISABLE REGISTRATION command is used to exit from
  REGISTRATION mode, and to return to Display mode signified by the
  prompt 'ROVER>' 

  On giving the command, the registration status line at the
  bottom of the display is replaced by the border text (if the TEXT
  option is enabled), and the cross cursor is deleted from the
  screen.  The command also causes all currently opened RCP files
  to be closed. 

  CTRL/Z (pressing the Ctrl and Z keys together) may also be used
  to exit from REGISTRATION mode. 

4  SAMPLE

  FORMAT:               DISABLE SAMPLE

  DISABLE SAMPLE disables the use of sub-sampling during the
  display of DTI files. Every DTI pixel in the current window is
  therefore displayed, regardless of the current sampling values
  set with the SAMPLE command. 

  Note that the command ENABLE REGISTRATION automatically enables
  sampling, while ENABLE EDIT automatically disables sampling. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 


4  TABLE

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE TABLE

  The DISABLE TABLE command turns off input from the digitising
  table. 
  Input from the table can be reselected using the ENABLE TABLE
  command. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of
  table input. 


4  TEXT

  FORMAT:	        DISABLE TEXT

  DISABLE TEXT disables the output of border information when a
  DISPLAY command is given. By default the DTI file name, area of
  interest, selected value range and number of colour values used
  in the display image are output to the screen. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status of the
  option. 

3  DISPLAY

  FORMAT:		DISPLAY 

  DISPLAY is the raster drawing command, that will output grid
  information contained in a mapped DTI file, to the graphics
  screen in colour coded form. 

  The currently selected DTI file, selected by means of the SELECT
  FILEIN command, is displayed. 

  RANGE, STEP, COLOURS, and FIRST_COLOUR settings for each DTI
  file are used to determine the exact nature of the displayed
  image, while only the information in the current area of interest
  set by the WINDOW command is displayed. The displayed image is
  automatically scaled to fill as much of the full screen or
  currently selected quadrant as possible, and is drawn in the
  direction specified by the latest ROTATE command. The default
  display direction is from the South. It should be noted that on
  certain devices DISPLAY is faster in some directions. 

  The DISPLAY command is also invoked implicitly by the ZOOM
  command and in EDIT mode by the STEP, RANGE, WINDOW, SELECT
  FILEIN, COLOURS, FIRST_COLOUR, FILEIN, and UPDATE_FILEIN
  commands. 
  See also the FAST command as an alternative method for output of
  byte data files. 
  Typing <CTRL/C> (Pressing the Ctrl and C keys together) aborts
  the display of the current file. 

3  DOWN

  FORMAT:		DOWN

  DOWN moves the raster editing cursor down by one DTI pixel.
  The command is only available in EDIT mode of operation.
  Puck button B is defined as DOWN.

3  DRAW LABEL

  FORMAT:		DRAW LABEL text

  Parameter:	text
  The text to be written to the display. Up to 80 characters of
  text may be specified. 

  The specified text is written to the display.
  By default the position of the text is along the bottom line of
  the current plotting area, and is output in overlay colour 1. 

  Both the size and position of the text may be changed by means of
  the LABEL SIZE and LABEL POSITION commands,  while the colour of
  annotation may be set using the LABEL COLOUR command. 

3  EDIT

  FORMAT:		EDIT

  The EDIT command is used to store the current matrix coordinates
  of the raster editing cursor, and all those pixels which join the
  current position to the previous position given with the latest
  EDIT command. Thus a series of EDIT and MOVE commands creates a
  line of pixels which may then be changed to a specific value on
  issue of the END command. Pixels which will be changed are
  highlighted in the current editing cursor colour. 

  During editing the program prompt is displayed as 'Line>' to
  indicate line editing is taking place. Line editing is the
  default mode of raster editing, but if the AREA_EDIT or
  SMOOTH_EDIT commands are used to initialise an editing operation
  then the EDIT command is also utilised. 

  This command is only available in EDIT mode of operation.

  ABANDON or <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl and Z keys together) will
  abort the edit operation. Puck button 4 and mouse or function 
  button 1 are defined to be EDIT. 

3  ENABLE

  FORMAT:		ENABLE 

  Valid qualifiers are:
  ABSOLUTE, COLOUR_MAP, CROSS_CURSOR, DEFAULT, DIGITISE, DIVIDE, EDIT, 
  FLOODING, HATCH, HEIGHT, INTERPOLATION, LEGEND, MASK, OVERRIDE, 
  PATTERN, PICTURE, POSITIONING, REGISTRATION, SAMPLE, TABLE, TEXT

4  ABSOLUTE

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE ABSOLUTE

  If ENABLE ABSOLUTE is given, then coordinate values required by
  the WINDOW or  MOVE commands, supplied in metre or projection
  units, must be specified as absolute (rather than relative)
  coordinate values. Coordinates for the IFFWINDOW command should
  also be supplied as absolute values. 
  For example if the projection indicates U.K. National Grid, then
  the WINDOW values may be specified as 6 figure National Grid
  coordinates. 
  By default window values should be specified as absolute
  coordinates. 
  This option can be disabled using the DISABLE ABSOLUTE command.

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 

4  COLOUR_MAP

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE COLOUR_MAP

  This command enables the use of a temporary mapped DTI file to
  speed up raster display. It is recommended that this option is
  enabled if many ZOOM or WINDOW commands are to be given during
  the course of a ROVER session. After initial draw of a large
  window, the subsequent WINDOW and ZOOM commands make use of the
  temporary colour map for fast redisplay. 

  It  should be noted that the use of the temporary colour map
  increases the time ROVER takes to exit because the file has to be
  unmapped. By default no temporary mapped file is used. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 

4  CROSS_CURSOR

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE CROSS_CURSOR

  ENABLE CROSS_CURSOR selects the use of a vector cross cursor in
  EDIT mode of operation. The cross cursor is the same size
  regardless of the dimensions of the DTI window displayed. Thus it
  is useful if a large window is displayed and consequently the 
  default square DTI-pixel sized cursor appears very small. 

  This command is only available in EDIT mode of operation. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 

4  DEFAULT

  FORMAT:          ENABLE DEFAULT rcp_qualifier
  
  Parameter:       rcp_qualifier    
  The name of a Registration Control Point attribute, chosen from:

      ALL       All RCP attributes
      RCP_ID    The RCP identifier
      RCP_TYPE  The RCP type identifier. 
      RCP_WXY   The RCP XY coordinate weighting value
      RCP_WZ    The RCP Z coordinate weighting value
      RCP_Z     The RCP Z coordinate value

  The DISABLE/ENABLE DEFAULT RCP commands controls which
  information the user is prompted for, when the RCP ADD command is
  given. 

  If ENABLE DEFAULT is specified then the user is NOT prompted
  for the specified RCP attribute, and the default attribute value
  will be used. For example, if the command ENABLE DEFAULT
  RCP_TYPE has been given, then the user will not be prompted for
  a RCP type identifier, and the default RCP type identifier will be
  used. The SET DEFAULT RCP commands control the default value that
  will be used. 

  By default no prompting for additional RCP information occurs,
  and the RCP fields are assigned their default values. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option when in Registration mode. 

4  DIGITISE

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE DIGITISE

  ENABLE DIGITISE enables the ROVER digitising mode of operation.
  Features may be digitised using the current settings with the SET
  LAYER, SET FSN and SET FC commands. A cursor is displayed which may
  be moved around the screen by pressing puck button 0. Commands
  START and END, which are issued from the cursor button, are used
  to create feature in the output file. 

  ENABLE DIGITISE may only be specified if a map has been setup
  using the SETUP MAP command. 

  Once this command has been  issued the program is in DIGITISE
  mode until DISABLE DIGITISE is specified. The program prompt
  becomes 'Digitise>' until DIGITISE mode is exited. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check the status  of the
  option. 

4  DIVIDE

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE DIVIDE

  ENABLE DIVIDE selects the use of quartered screen display mode.
  Each quadrant is treated by the program as though it were a
  separate graphics screen. This allows four different files to be
  displayed simultaneously, or alternatively different
  representations of the same file may be shown. 

  The 4 quadrants are identified as follows:

  	1   =   Top lefthand quadrant

  	2   =   Top righthand quadrant 

	3   =   Bottom righthand quadrant

  	4   =   Bottom lefthand quadrant

  Subsequent display commands display the files in the current
  quadrant specified with the QUADRANT command. The default
  quadrant is the top left corner (quadrant 1). 

  In EDIT mode this command causes automatic redisplay of the
  currently selected DTI file. 

4  EDIT

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE EDIT

  ENABLE EDIT enables the raster editing mode of operation. After
  this command has been specified then the various raster editing
  commands are available. The currently selected DTI file may be
  edited. A status display of the current editing cursor position
  and DTI value are shown. Thus this command is useful to allow
  interrogation of the values in the DTI file even if the file has
  only been opened for read with the FILEIN command. Actual editing
  commands may only be specified, however if the currently selected
  DTI file has been opened for write with the UPDATE_FILEIN
  command. 

  WARNING: Edits on DTI files are carried out in-situ. Thus edited
  DTI pixels are changed in the disk file immediately. To safeguard
  against possible file corruption, it is recommended that copies
  of files are made prior to a Rover editing session. 

  Once this command has been issued the program is in EDIT mode
  until DISABLE EDIT has been specified. The program prompt becomes
  'Edit>' until EDIT mode is exited or an editing operation is
  carried out. 
  If the currently selected DTI file has not yet been displayed,
  then this command causes its automatic display. 

4  FLOODING

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE FLOODING

  ENABLE FLOODING turns on the interactive flooding control from
  the mouse, trackerball or table. The effect of "flooding" is
  achieved by dynamically rewriting the colour table to blue. The
  extent of the flooding may be varied by moving the mouse  or
  table puck in the Y direction. In the latter case a map should
  have been registered to provide limits for the flooding. The
  flooding takes place within the current RANGE settings and
  according to the current STEP intervals. The current flood level
  is displayed at the bottom of the screen. 

  During flooding the program prompt is displayed as 'Flood>'
  ENABLE FLOODING is only available in EDIT mode. Puck button E
  alternately enables and disables flooding. 

4  HATCH

  FORMAT:		ENABLE HATCH [line-width, line-separation]

  Parameter: 	line-width
  The width of the hatched lines. A valid real number is required
  Parameter: 	line-separation
  The separation of the hatched lines. A valid real number
  is required. 

  ENABLE HATCH allows hatching parameters specified specified in
  the width and size entries in the FRT file to be overriden for
  vector display with the OVERLAY command. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  HEIGHT

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE HEIGHT

  The ENABLE HEIGHT command specifies that text sizes are taken
  from the TH entry of the IFF file rather than from the FRT file. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  INTERPOLATION

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE INTERPOLATION

  ENABLE INTERPOLATION selects curve Interpolation of graphical
  type 6 features in the IFF file, using the current interpolation
  method specified with the INTERPOLATE command for vector overlay.
  The default is to interpolate using AKIMA interpolation. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  LEGEND

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE LEGEND

  ENABLE LEGEND enables the display of a colour/value guide and an
  overlay colour guide when a DISPLAY command is  given. 
  The position of the LEGEND on the screen may be changed with the
  LEGEND POSITION command. 
  Legend display is automatically disabled if a large window which
  cannot fit in the default display area is specified. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  MASK

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE MASK

  By default the vector information is drawn to Picture 2 in one of
  the available overlay colours. 
  Using MASK the vector information may be drawn in Picture 1 in
  the background colour. This allows the underlying image to be
  masked. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  OVERRIDE

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE OVERRIDE layer FC

  Parameter:	layer
  The layer number in which overriding is to take place.  An
  integer value in the range 0 to 32767 is required 
	
  Parameter:	FC
  The supplied feature code. An integer value in the range 
  0 to 32767 is required.

  ENABLE OVERRIDE causes all feature codes for all features in the
  specified layer to be set to the supplied feature code value.
  This allows all features within a layer to be treated as
  identical for overlay purposes. 
  Up to 256 layer/feature code equations may be set up.
  DISABLE OVERRIDE will cancel the settings.
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  PATTERN

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE PATTERN

  ENABLE PATTERN specifies that all lines specified as patterned in
  the FRT file will be drawn as patterned when the OVERLAY command
  is issued.  This is the default mode of operation
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4  PICTURE

  FORMAT:		 ENABLE PICTURE picnum     

  Parameter:	picnum
  The picture number. An integer value in the range 1 to 2
  is required. 

  Picture 1 contains the raster information output using the
  DISPLAY command. 
  Picture 2 contains any vector information drawn using the OVERLAY
  command, and any user annotation drawn using the DRAW LABEL
  command. 

  ENABLE PICTURE makes the specified picture visible, after a
  previous DISABLE PICTURE command had made it invisible. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the 2
  pictures.

4  POSITIONING

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE POSITIONING

  ENABLE POSITIONING enables the use of the justification code
  (0-8) stored in the FS entry for text positioning for vector
  overlay. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

4 REGISTRATION

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE REGISTRATION

  The ENABLE REGISTRATION command is used to enter ROVER
  REGISTRATION mode.  Registration mode is signified by the prompt
  'Registration>' on the terminal. 

  After giving the command all registration related commands such
  as OPEN RCP_FILE and RCP ADD, are available. 

  The description section contains details on the purpose and
  operation of REGISTRATION mode. 

4 SAMPLE

  FORMAT:                ENABLE SAMPLE

  The ENABLE SAMPLE command enables sub-sampling of the DTI values
  during display. The column and row sample intervals may be set by
  the SAMPLE command. 

  The command also enables Rover to reset the sampling intervals
  automatically if the window, specified explicitly with the WINDOW
  command  or implicitly with the ZOOM command, is too large to be
  displayed with the current sample values in the display area. 

  While sampling is enabled window values may be adjusted slightly
  to ensure that the the current window extents consist of a whole
  number of sample intervals. A warning message is issued when this
  occurs. 

  Note that the command ENABLE REGISTRATION automatically enables
  sampling, while ENABLE EDIT automatically disables sampling. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of
  this option. 


4  TABLE

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE TABLE

  The ENABLE TABLE command initialises the table monitor to allow
  input from a digitising table. The command SETUP MAP may be used
  to register a map to the DTI file. In the event of failure, input
  from the digitising table or puck button is not possible, and the
  program will accept commands only from the terminal. 

  Table initialisation will generally fail because no Table Monitor
  is currently active, or because the Table Monitor is locked by
  another user. If neither of these reasons appear to apply, you
  should consult the TABLIB Reference Manual, or seek guidance from
  your system manager. 

  If the logical name LSL$AUTO_ENABLE_TABLE is defined with a
  value of "1", then the table is initialised  on program startup. 

  The DISABLE TABLE command may be used to turn off input from the
  digitising table. 

  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of
  table input. 


4  TEXT

  FORMAT:	        ENABLE TEXT

  ENABLE TEXT enables the output of border information when a
  DISPLAY command is given. The DTI filename, area of interest,
  selected value range and number of colour levels used in the
  display image are output. 
  The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of the
  option. 

3  END

  FORMAT:		END [DTI-value]

  Parameter:	DTI-value
  The DTI value to be assigned to the pixels which have been
  edited. The range of the value which may be specified is
  dependent on the data type of the file which is being edited. A
  byte file requires an integer  value in the range 0 to 255, while
  a word file requires an integer in the range -32767 to 32767. 
  Note that the command parameter is only valid in EDIT mode.

  In the DIGITISE mode the END command ends the construction of the
  current feature. The digitised line is then stored in the output
  IFF file. 
  In EDIT mode END finishes the current editing sequence. The
  DTI-value supplied is assigned to the pixels which have been
  specified. If no parameter is supplied then the user is prompted
  for a DTI value. 
  The END command is available only if ENABLE EDIT or ENABLE
  DIGITISE commands have been specified. 
  END is defined as puck button 5
  In EDIT mode mouse or function button 2 is defined as end. 

3  ENLARGE

  FORMAT:		ENLARGE

  The screen image is magnified by a factor of 2 using pixel
  replication. If the command is repeatedly given the display will
  continue to be enlarged until the maximum magnification (x 16) is
  reached. 
  Puck button 2 is defined as ENLARGE.
  This command has no effect on a graphics device which does not
  support hardware pixel replication. 

3  EXIT

  FORMAT:		EXIT

  The program is terminated, and any currently opened DTI files
  will be  unmapped, along with any input or output IFF files. 
  Typing <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl and Z keys together) also exits 
  the program in the normal display mode.
	
3  FAST

  FORMAT:		FAST

  The FAST command may be used as an alternative to the DISPLAY
  command to output data more quickly to the graphics screen. The
  DTI file file values are output directly to the graphics device
  with no colour lookup calculations. Thus the current RANGE, STEP,
  COLOURS and FIRST_COLOUR values are not used. Because there is a
  limit of 255 colours which may be displayed, only files with byte
  datatype may be displayed with the FAST command. 

  The command requires that enough planes are set for the maximum
  value in the currently selected file to be output. The maximum
  value should be less than 2 raised to the power of (n) - 1, where
  n is the current planes setting. 

  Thus a file with a maximum value of 64 requires a PLANES setting
  of 7, while a file with a maximum value of 63 requires only 6
  planes to be used for the raster drawing. 

  The file is drawn in the direction specified by the latest ROTATE
  command. The default display direction is from the South. It
  should be noted that on some devices display speeds improve in
  certain directions. Typing <CTRL/C> (Pressing the Ctrl and C keys
  together) aborts the FAST display of the current file. 

3  FILEIN

  FORMAT:	        FILEIN  file-spec

  Parameters:	file-spec
  The file specification for the input DTI file. Any part of the
  file specification not supplied is taken from the default
  'LSL$DTI:DTI.DTI' 

  This command opens and maps into memory a DTI file for read
  access. The file is opened on the lowest available DTI file
  number.  The DTI file number is displayed on the terminal, and is
  the means by which the file is selected when a number of DTI
  files are opened. 
  Details derived from the header of the file are displayed on the
  terminal to confirm that the file has been successfully opened. 
  Up to 4 DTI files may be opened at one time.  By default the DTI
  file opened with the last FILEIN or UPDATE_FILEIN command is the
  current DTI file. 
  If the logical name LSL$MATRIX_DEFAULT_WINDOW is defined with a
  value of "1", then a default area of interest is set for the file
  based on the maximum window which may be displayed in the default
  display area on the graphics device at four times magnification. 
  Otherwise a window corresponding to the entire file extents is
  set unless this is too large to be displayed in which case
  truncation takes place. 

  The   area of interest may be altered at any time by use of the
  WINDOW command. 
  
  Information on the mapped DTI file may be obtained at any time by
  typing 'SHOW FILEIN'. 
  Note that editing operations may not be performed on a file that
  has been opened with FILEIN (cf UPDATE_FILEIN). 

  In EDIT mode issue of the FILEIN command results in automatic
  display of the file. 

3  FIRST_COLOUR

  FORMAT:		FIRST_COLOUR base-colour

  Parameters:	base-colour

  The base colours for raster display. An integer in the range 1 to
  2 raised to the power n (where n is the current planes setting)
  should be supplied. The default value is 3. 

  FIRST_COLOUR defines the starting colour index for raster display
  of the currently selected DTI file. It enables, in conjunction
  with the COLOURS command, different parts of the colour table to
  be used to display different DTI files. (eg. a colour image
  alongside a grey scale image). The base colour itself is used for
  the display of zero values in the DTI matrix (normally blue for
  digital elevation models) and is not included in the actual
  colour indices. The current base colour setting may be examined
  using the SHOW PARAMETERS command. 
  Note that redefining the first colour, may change the step 
  interval values previously set by the STEP command.
  In EDIT mode of operation this command causes automatic redisplay
  of the currently selected DTI file 
                
3  FLOOD

  FORMAT:	        FLOOD wait_time

  Parameters:	wait_time
  The time to wait in seconds between the flood steps.  The default
  time is one second. 

  This is the Rover non-interactive flooding facility (cf ENABLE
  FLOODING). Each colour index is dynamically respecified to be
  blue. The effect is the successive recolouring of the displayed
  image until it becomes entirely blue. The time interval specified
  is the wait interval between the rewriting of each colour in the
  colour table. 

  To clear the effect of flooding a lookup table should be
  respecified with the LUT command. 

3  FRT

  FORMAT:	        FRT  file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The file specification for the FRT file. Any part of the file
  specification not supplied will be taken from the default
  'LSL$FRT:FRT.FRT' 

  This command selects and reads the contents of the specified
  Feature Representation Table. 
  The FRT is used by ROVER to look up the graphical type of a
  feature, and to consequently determine the graphical
  representation of the feature when drawn. 
  The table also defines feature code group names that may be
  supplied as parameters to the SELECT FC or DESELECT FC commands. 
  The command must be given before the OVERLAY command.

3  HELP

  FORMAT:		HELP [command]

  Parameter:	command
  The command for which help is required.

  A brief description is given of the function and format of the
  specified  command. If no parameter is specified then a complete
  list of available commands are output. 

3  IFF

  FORMAT:	        IFF  file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The file specification  of the input IFF file. Any part of the
  file specification not supplied will be taken from the default
  'LSL$IF:IFF.IFF' 

  Selects and opens the IFF file containing the vector data to be
  drawn using the OVERLAY command. 

  A default area of interest within the IFF file is set when the
  file is opened. This may be subsequently altered using the
  IFFWINDOW command. If origin offset values are present in the
  headers of the DTI and IFF files, then the IFF window is set with
  respect to the current DTI window.  This allows registration
  between the raster image and the vector overlay to take place
  automatically. If no such header information is present, or if
  the DISABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given, then the default
  area of interest in the IFF file that corresponds to the IFF
  range entry (RA) values is set. 

  The IFF file range and IFF window may be examined using the
  command SHOW IFF. 

3  IFFWINDOW

  FORMAT:	        IFFWINDOW swx swy nex ney

  Parameters:	swx swy nex ney

  The IFF coordinates of the south-west (bottom lefthand) and
  north-west (top righthand) corners of the window. The coordinates
  are specified in IFF units, as real (floating point) values. 

  IFFWINDOW is used to define a rectangular area of interest within
  the IFF file. By default or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE command has
  been given then window values should be supplied in absolute IFF
  units. Otherwise values should be specified as an offset from the
  SW corner of the IFF file area. 

  The IFFWINDOW command enables the IFF file to be registered to
  the current area of interest in the DTI file. 

  When the command is given, a transformation matrix for IFF to DTI
  coordinate conversion is calculated, based on the coordinates of
  the IFF and DTI windows. 

  The command SHOW IFF may be used to examine the IFF range and
  window coordinate values. 

  Before giving the command an IFF file must have been selected
  using the IFF command. 

3  INTERPOLATION

  FORMAT:		INTERPOLATION qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:
  AKIMA, MCCONALOGUE

4  AKIMA

  FORMAT:	        INTERPOLATION AKIMA

  This command specifies the AKIMA interpolation method for the
  overlay of graphical type 6 curve features. This is the default
  method of interpolation. 

4  MCCONALOGUE

  FORMAT:	        INTERPOLATION MCCONALOGUE

  This command specifies the MCCONALOGUE interpolation method for
  the overlay of graphical type 6 curve features. 
  The default method of interpolation is INTERPOLATION AKIMA. 

3  LABEL

  FORMAT:		LABEL qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:
  COLOUR, POSITION, SIZE

4  COLOUR

  FORMAT:		LABEL COLOUR overlay-colour

  Parameter:	overlay-colour
  The colour value of the labels.  An integer value in the range of
  1 up to 7 is required depending on the current PLANES setting. 

  The colour of user labelling is selected. 
  By default user labels will be drawn in overlay colour 1.  If
  more than 1 overlay colour is available (dependent upon the
  current PLANES setting), another overlay colour may be selected
  using this command. The available colours are displayed in the
  legend. 

4  POSITION

  FORMAT:		LABEL POSITION screenx screeny

  Parameters:	screenx, screeny
  The screen coordinates in pixel units. 
  Two real  values are required. 

  The position of the user annotation is defined
  The position is specified in screen pixel units, with respect to
  the SW corner of the screen. 
	
4  SIZE
	
  FORMAT:		LABEL SIZE font-size

  Parameter:	font-size
  The size of the user text. An integer in the range 1 (smallest)
  to 4 (largest) is required.  The default size is 2. 

  The command LABEL SIZE is used to define the size of any text
  output to a graphics screen using the DRAW LABEL command. 

  The font_size parameter controls the relative size of the text;
  size 1 is the smallest, and size 4 is the largest.  The actual
  size of the output text screen will vary with the size of the
  graphics device screen, though the relative sizes of the text
  will remain constant. 

3  LEFT

  FORMAT:		LEFT

  LEFT moves the raster editing cursor to the left by one DTI
  pixel. 
  The command is only available in EDIT mode of operation
  Puck button 8 is defined as LEFT.

3  LEGEND

  FORMAT: 	LEGEND qualifier

  Valid qualifier is:
  POSITION

4  POSITION

  FORMAT:		LEGEND POSITION screenx screeny

  Parameters:	screenx, screeny
  The screen coordinates in pixel units.  Two real values are
  required. 

  The position of the legend is specified in screen pixel units,
  with respect to the bottom left corner of the screen. 

3  LUT

  FORMAT:	        LUT  file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The file specification for the new colour table. Any part of the
  file specification not supplied will be taken from the default
  LSL$LOOKUP:.DAT. 

  This command is used to read in a new look up colour table. The
  colour table is a file containing the RGB definitions for a
  series of colour values. These values are used when images are
  displayed on the screen. 
  The default colour table which is read in on program
  initialisation is ROVER5.DAT, but these colour values may be
  subsequently changed by use of the LUT command. 

  The colour table that is read in should be appropriate for the
  current PLANES settings, in order to achieve correct display of
  both raster and vector information. 

3  MESSAGE

  FORMAT:	        MESSAGE text

  Parameter:	text
  The text to be output to the terminal.  Up to 80 characters of
  text may be specified. 
	
  This command outputs the specified text to the terminal. The
  command is useful to use in Rover Command Files to pass
  information  before a RESPOND command returns control to the
  user. 

3  MODTEN

  FORMAT:	        MODTEN

  MODTEN causes redisplay of the currently selected DTI file using
  a remainder of a division by 10 function. The resulting image
  displays the DTI values in one of 10 shades of grey depending on
  the value of the last digit. Thus 53 and 73 are both displayed
  with the same grey value. 
  Because local differences in DTI value are emphasised, MODTEN is
  a useful tool for terrain model validation.
  MODTEN makes use of one of the standard greyscale ROVER lookup
  tables depending on the current PLANES setting. Subsequent
  displays after a MODTEN display revert to the original lookup
  table. 

3  MOVE

  FORMAT:	        MOVE   x_position y_position

  Parameters:	x_position, y_position
  The x and y coordinates of the target position.
  The format of the command parameters is controlled by the UNITS
  command. 
  UNITS MATRIX - 2 integer values are required defining the
  position of the target position in terms of row and column
  values. 
  UNITS METRES - 2 real (floating point) values are required
  defining the position as  x and y metre offsets from the SW
  corner of the matrix. By default, or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE
  command has been given, the values are absolute coordinates (eg.
  U.K. National Grid coordinates); if the DISABLE ABSOLUTE command
  has been given, then the coordinates are offsets from the SW
  corner of the matrix. 
  UNITS SECONDS - 2 real (floating point) values are required
  defining the absolute target position in seconds of arc. The
  values are supplied in the order latitude followed by longitude.
  A negative latitude value indicates a position in the Southern
  Hemisphere, and a negative longitude value a point to the west of
  Greenwich. 
  UNITS LATLONG - 2 values are required defining the absolute
  latitude and longitude position in the format DDD MM SS H where
  DDD is the number of degrees, MM is the number of minutes, SS is
  the number of seconds, and H is the hemisphere (N,S,E,W). The
  values are supplied in the order latitude followed by longitude. 
  UNITS PROJECTION  Requires 2 real (floating point) values
  defining the target position in projection record units. By
  default, or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given, the
  values are absolute coordinates; if the DISABLE ABSOLUTE command
  has been given, then the coordinates are offsets from the SW
  corner of the matrix. 

  Note that in all cases, the input values are adjusted to the
  nearest column and row values. 

  This command moves the DTI editing cursor to the specified
  coordinates. The status values on the screen reflect the current
  cursor position and underlying colour. The SHOW POSITION command
  may be used to examine the position in the current UNITS of
  measurement. 

  If a position outside the current DTI window is specified then an
  implicit ZOOM 1 command around the new position is obeyed. 
  This command may also be issued by moving the mouse or 
  trackerball within the displayed area. 
  This command is only available in EDIT mode of operation.
  Puck button 0 is  defined to be move if a map has been registered
  with the SETUP MAP command. 

3  OPEN

  Valid qualifier is:
  RCP_FILE

4  RCP_FILE

  FORMAT:	        OPEN RCP_FILE file-spec

  Parameter:     file-spec
  The RCP file specification. Any part of the file
  specification not supplied will be taken from the default
  'LSL$RCP:RCP.RCP'. 

  The OPEN RCP_FILE command is used to open and read the contents
  of an existing Registration Control Point file.  The file will
  most likely have been created during an earlier ROVER session. 

  Up to 4 RCP files may be opened.  The SELECT RCP command controls
  which RCP file is current.  By default, the current file is the
  most recent RCP file to be opened or created using the OPEN
  RCP_FILE and CREATE RCP_FILE commands. The contents of the
  current RCP file may be examined using the SHOW RCP command. 

  Entries in the current RCP file may be deleted or edited using
  the RCP DELETE and RCP EDIT commands, and new entries may be
  added to the file using the RCP ADD command. 

3  OUTPUT

  FORMAT:	        OUTPUT file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The output IFF file specification. Any part of the file
  specification not supplied will be taken from the default
  'LSL$IF:IFF.IFF'. 

  An output IFF file can be specified to receive data generated
  using the program's digitising option using this command. 
  A new output file is always opened.  It is not possible to
  digitise to an existing file. 

  The output file uses the corner values and map descriptor
  information from the input IFF file if one is open. Digitised
  coordinates will also be in the units of the input IFF file.
  Otherwise, header information is copied from the projection
  record if one is present in the currently selected DTI file.
  Appropriate units are used depending on the type of the DTI file.
  If the input file is a TED4 or UHL1 file then units are in tenths
  of seconds. Projection units are used for DTI files containing a
  projection record. Otherwise DTI matrix units are used. 

  This command is only valid if a map has been registered to the
  DTI file. If an output IFF file is already open then it is first
  closed before the new file is open. 


3  OVERLAY

  FORMAT:		 OVERLAY

  OVERLAY causes any IFF features currently selected in the IFF
  file to be drawn in Picture 2 in the current quadrant position. 

  The graphical representation of features is determined by FRT
  lookup on the basis of their feature code. The colour used to
  draw the data may be set using the SET COLOUR command. The
  representation of features may also be changed by the ENABLE
  POSITIONING, ENABLE HEIGHT, ENABLE HATCH, ENABLE INTERPOLATION,
  ENABLE OVERRIDE, ENABLE TEXT and SCALE 
  commands.

  The displayed map is scaled so that it occupies the same area  on
  the screen as the previously displayed raster information.
  Registration with the raster image is achieved by selecting an
  IFFWINDOW to cover the same area as the DTI window. This is achieved 
  automatically if files contain absolute origin offset information
  in their headers.

  Typing <CTRL/C> (Pressing the Ctrl and C keys together) causes
  the current OVERLAY operation to be aborted. 

3  PING

  FORMAT:		 PING

  This command causes a warning bell sound to be made at the
  terminal. PING may be a useful command in ROVER Command Files to
  indicate that control has returned to the user after a RESPOND
  command has been issued. 


3  PLANES

  FORMAT:		 PLANES numplanes

  Parameter:	numplanes
  The number of bit planes to be assigned to picture 1.  An integer
  value in the range 5 to 8 is required. 

  PLANES defines the number of bit-planes on a graphics device, and
  therefore the number of colours, that will be used to display the
  raster information in Picture 1. 
  By default a set of 5 contiguous planes are allocated to Picture
  1. If 5 planes are defined, then 32 colours are available for the
  picture 1  although it should be noted that only 29 colours will
  actually be used for display, since the first 3 colours have a
  special use. 

  The remaining planes on an 8 bit-plane graphics device are used
  for the display of any vector overlay drawn using the OVERLAY
  command, and for any annotation generated using the DRAW LABEL
  command. With a planes setting of 5, 7 overlay and annotation
  colours are available.  The LABEL COLOUR command may be used to
  select the annotation colour, while the colour entry in the FRT
  determines in what colour, different overlay features are shown. 
  It should be noted that after giving the PLANES command, a
  default colour table appropriate to the number of planes, is
  read.  The effect of this will either be seen immediately if a
  DTI file is already displayed. 

3  QUADRANT

  FORMAT:		QUADRANT quadrant_number

  Parameter:	quadrant-number
  The quadrant number An integer value in the range 1 to 4 is
  required. 

    where   quadrant_number 1   =   Top lefthand quadrant
            quadrant_number 2   =   Top righthand quadrant 
            quadrant_number 3   =   Bottom righthand quadrant
            quadrant_number 4   =   Bottom lefthand quadrant

  This command enables the user to control  which quadrant becomes
  current for display purposes. 
  The quartered screen quadrant is selected for enlargement using
  ENLARGE, or to receive information output using the DISPLAY or
  OVERLAY commands. 
  The SHOW DEVICE command outputs information about which DTI file
  is currently associated with each quadrant. 
  This command is not valid in EDIT mode and is only valid if  use
  of a quartered screen has been enabled using the ENABLE DIVIDE
  command. 

3  RANGE

  FORMAT:		RANGE lowval upval

  Parameters:	lowval, upval

  The lower and upper range values. Two integer arguments are
  required within the header range of the IFF file. If the input
  file has real, or longword, datatype then the range is restricted
  between the values -32767 and 32766 even if the header values lie
  outside these limits. 

  The command is used to specify a lower and upper range of DTI
  values for the currently selected DTI file.  Values outside this
  range will be displayed in black on the screen when the DISPLAY
  command is given. 
  Issue of the RANGE command always preserves the current STEP
  settings. If there are by consequence too few colours to show all
  the steps in the range,  then the upper steps are displayed in
  white. 
  The current range values, along with the current range values
  stored in the file header and in the current DTI window, may be
  shown using the SHOW RANGES command. 
  In EDIT mode the RANGE command causes automatic redisplay of the
  currently selected DTI file. 

3  RCP

  Valid qualifiers are:
  ADD, DELETE, EDIT, MOVE

4  ADD

  FORMAT:		RCP ADD x_coord y_coord

  Parameters:           x_coord y_coord
  The x and y coordinates of the RCP.  
  The format of the command parameters is controlled by the UNITS
  command. 
  UNITS MATRIX - 2 real (floating point) values are required
  defining the position of the RCP in terms of columns and rows. 
  UNITS METRES - 2 real (floating point) values are required
  defining the position of the RCP in metre values. By default, or
  if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given, the values are
  absolute coordinates (eg. U.K. National Grid coordinates); if the
  DISABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given, then the coordinates are
  offsets from the SW corner of the matrix. 
  UNITS SECONDS - 2 real (floating point) values are required
  defining the absolute position of the RCP in seconds of arc. The
  values are supplied in the order latitude followed by longitude.
  A negative latitude value indicates a position in the Southern
  Hemisphere, and a negative longitude value a point to the west of
  Greenwich. 
  UNITS LATLONG - 2 values are required defining the absolute
  latitude and longitude position of the RCP in the format DDD MM
  SS H where DDD is the number of degrees, MM is the number of
  minutes, SS is the number of seconds, and H is the hemisphere
  (N,S,E,W). The values are supplied in the order latitude followed
  by longitude. 
  UNITS PROJECTION - 2 real (floating point) values defining the
  position of the RCP in DTI file projection record units (eg. mms
  on the map sheet). By default, or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE command
  has been given, the values are absolute coordinates; if the
  DISABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given, then the coordinates are
  offsets from the SW corner of the matrix. 

  The RCP ADD command is used to add a Registration Control Point
  to the currently selected RCP file. 
  The command parameters define the x and y position of the RCP. 

  The parameters may be supplied on the command line, or may be
  recorded by pressing the middle button on the workstation mouse,
  or button 4 on the table puck if a map has been set up on the
  table.  The coordinates of the RCP must lie within the
  geographical bounds of the DTM, or the corners of the map
  positioned on the table. 

  The DISABLE/ENABLE DEFAULT RCP commands control whether the user
  is prompted for additional RCP information.  For example, if the
  command DISABLE DEFAULT RCP_ID has been given, then the user is
  prompted to enter an RCP identifier. The SET DEFAULT RCP commands
  control the default value that is supplied with a prompt, and
  which may be accepted using carriage return. By default no
  prompting for additional RCP information occurs, and the RCP
  fields are assigned their default values. 

4  DELETE

  FORMAT:               RCP DELETE rcp_identifier

  Parameter:            rcp_identifier
  The RCP identifier.  A string of up to 10 characters is required.

  The RCP DELETE command is used to remove a Registration Control
  Point from the currently selected RCP file.  The rcp_identifier
  determines which RCP is deleted. 
  Note that once deleted from the file, a RCP cannot be recovered.

4  EDIT

  FORMAT:               RCP EDIT rcp_identifier

  Parameter:            rcp_identifier
  The RCP identifier.  A string of up to 10 characters is required.

  The RCP EDIT command is used to edit an existing Registration
  Control Point in the currently selected RCP file.  The
  rcp_identifier determines which RCP is edited. 

  On giving the command, the screen cross cursor is positioned on
  the RCP location. (If the location is outside the current screen
  window, then a zoom with a factor of 1 is carried out around the
  RCP location).  The user is then prompted for all RCP attributes,
  including a RCP identifier and RCP x y coordinates.  The existing
  value or values are supplied as the default with each prompt, and
  may be accepted by pressing carriage return. 

  New RCP coordinates may be entered from the terminal, or by
  pressing the middle button on the workstation mouse, or button 4
  on the table puck if a map has been set up on the table. 

  The new values (including the RCP identifier) replace the
  existing RCP values. 

4  MOVE

  FORMAT:               RCP MOVE rcp_identifier

  Parameter:            rcp_identifier
  The RCP identifier.  A string of up to 10 characters is required.

  The RCP MOVE command is used to position the screen cursor on a
  Registration Control Point recorded in the currently selected RCP
  file. 

  For example, the command RCP MOVE 1 will move the cursor to the
  location of an RCP with an identifier of 1. 

  If the coordinates of the RCP define a point outside the current
  screen window, then a zoom with a factor of 1 is carried out
  around the RCP position. 


3  REDUCE

  FORMAT:	        REDUCE

  The screen image is reduced by a factor of 2 using pixel
  replication. If the command is repeatedly given the display will
  continue to be reduced until the minimum magnification is
  reached. 
  Puck button 3 is defined as REDUCE. 
  This command has no effect on a graphics device which does not
  support hardware pixel replication. 

3  REMOVE

  FORMAT:	        REMOVE

  Remove is the raster editing command to remove the latest edited
  point from the current line being edited. Thus it cancels the
  effect of the previous EDIT command, and all pixels on the line
  joining the current point to the previous point are redrawn in
  their original colour. 
  A series of REMOVE commands may be used to cancel several
  previous EDIT commands. 
  This command is only available in EDIT mode of operation.
  Mouse or function button 3 and puck button 7 are defined to be
  REMOVE. 

3  RESET_MINMAX

  FORMAT:		RESET_MINMAX

  RESET_MINMAX updates the minimum and maximum values in the
  headers of those files which have been opened for write access by
  the UPDATE_FILEIN command. 
  An Implicit RESET_MINMAX command is carried out by ROVER on
  issue of the DISABLE EDIT command, to ensure that any edits which
  have been performed on the file are reflected in the file header.
  RESET_MINMAX also shows the current values of window, program
  and file ranges. 

3  RESPOND

  FORMAT:		RESPOND

  RESPOND is used within a Rover Command File to pass control back
  to the terminal. The user may again type commands in response to
  the program prompt. Command file execution may be resumed on
  issue of the CONTINUE command. RESPOND is only valid within a
  Rover command file. 

3  RIGHT

  FORMAT:		RIGHT

  RIGHT moves the raster editing cursor to the right by one DTI
  pixel. 
  The command is only available in EDIT mode of operation.
  Puck button A is defined as RIGHT.

3  ROTATE

  FORMAT:		ROTATE direction

  Parameter:	direction
  A keyword describing the display direction. Valid keywords are
  NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST. 

  This command allows the user to specify the direction from which
  the raster image is to be displayed using the FAST and DISPLAY
  commands. 
  The default direction is to view from the South.
  On some display devices display speeds may be better in certain
  directions. 

3  SAMPLE

  FORMAT:	        SAMPLE column_interval row_interval

  Parameter1:           column_interval
  The sample interval along the columns of the DTI file. A positive
  integer value is required. 

  Parameter2:           row_interval
  The sample interval along the rows of the DTI file. A positive
  integer value is required. If this parameter is omitted then it
  is assumed to be equal to column_interval. 

  SAMPLE is used to define the intervals at which columns and rows
  of the currently selected DTI file are sampled during display. 

  By default all nodes in the current window are displayed. (ie. a
  sample interval of 1 along both the columns and rows). 

  The ENABLE SAMPLE command must be given before the defined sample
  values take effect. 

  Note that the sampling intervals may be automatically reset if a
  window, specified explicitly with the WINDOW command  or
  implicitly with the ZOOM command, is too large to be displayed
  with the current sample values in the display area. A warning
  message is output when this occurs. 

  The current sample values may be viewed using the SHOW FILES
  command. 

3  SCALE

  FORMAT:		SCALE factor

  Parameter:	factor
  The text and symbol scale factor. A positive real value is
  required. 

  This command is used to scale the symbols, text and hatching
  parameters for output of vector information with the OVERLAY
  command. The values specified in the FRT table are enlarged by
  the specified factor. 

3  SELECT

  FORMAT:		SELECT qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:
  ALL, FC, FSN, LAYER, RCP_FILE

4  ALL

  FORMAT:	        SELECT ALL

  This command resets all features to be selected for overlay. If
  features are subsequently selected using the other SELECT
  commands then all features are first implicitly deselected. 
  This command is only valid after a FRT file has been specified. 

4  FC

  FORMAT:         SELECT FC feature_code [,...]

  Parameters:	feature-code
  An integer feature code in the range 0 to 32767. Multiple feature
  codes may be specified separated by commas or spaces, while a
  range of feature codes may be specified by means of a '-'. eg.
  SELECT FC 10-13 selects feature codes 10,11,12 and 13. 
  Alternatively a valid FRT group name may be specified. 

  The SELECT FC command is used to include IFF features for vector
  overlay. Features are included on the basis of their feature
  code. 
  By default ROVER will use all features within an IFF file. 
  Use of the SHOW SELECTIONS command is recommended to display
  feature selections before the OVERLAY command is given. 
  The SELECT FC command is only valid if  the FRT command has been
  used to select a Feature Representation Table. 

4  FILEIN

  FORMAT:		 SELECT FILEIN file-number

  Parameter:	file-number
  The assigned DTI file number.  An integer in the range 1 to 4 is
  required. 

  This command sets the DTI file with the assigned number to be the
  current DTI file. 
  Commands such as WINDOW, UNITS, STEP, RANGE, FIRST and COLOURS
  are applied to the DTI file currently selected using the SELECT
  FILEIN command . 

  If EDIT mode is enabled then editing may only be performed on the
  currently selected DTI file. In quartered screen mode, this
  command allows up to 4 different files to be edited on the same
  display. The currently selected  file has the Editing status
  information displayed at the bottom of the quadrant. If the
  currently selected DTI file is not displayed then issue of this
  command causes automatic DISPLAY. 
  By default the current DTI file is the file last opened using the
  FILEIN  command. 

4  FSN

  FORMAT:         SELECT FSN fsn [,...]

  Parameters:	fsn
  An integer feature serial number in the range 0 to 65534.
  Multiple  feature serial numbers may be specified separated by
  commas or spaces, while a range of feature  serial numbers may be
  specified by means of a '-'. eg. SELECT FSN  10-13 selects 
  feature serial numbers 10,11,12 and 13. 

  The SELECT FSN command is used to include IFF features for vector
  overlay. Features are included on the basis of their feature
  serial number. 
  By default ROVER will use all features within an IFF file. 
  Use of the SHOW SELECTIONS command is recommended to display
  feature selections before the OVERLAY command is given. 
  The SELECT FSN command is only valid if an IFF file has been
  specified  and the FRT command has been used to select a Feature
  Representation Table. 

4  LAYER

  FORMAT:         SELECT LAYER layer [,...]

  Parameters:	layer
  An integer feature serial number in the range 0 to 32767.
  Multiple  layer numbers may be specified separated by commas or
  spaces, while a range of layer  numbers may be specified by means
  of a '-'. eg. SELECT LAYER 10-13 selects feature serial numbers
  10,11,12 and 13. 

  The SELECT LAYER command is used to include IFF features for
  vector overlay. Features are included on the basis of their layer
  number. 
  By default ROVER will use all features within an IFF file. 
  Use of the SHOW SELECTIONS command is recommended to display
  feature selections before the OVERLAY command is given. 
  The SELECT LAYER command is only valid if  the FRT command has
  been used to select a Feature Representation Table. 

4  RCP_FILE

  FORMAT:         SELECT RCP_FILE number

  Parameters:	number
  The number of the RCP file.  An integer value in the range 1 to 4
  is required. 

  The SELECT RCP_FILE command is used to select and make current a
  Registration Control Point (RCP) file. 

  The commands RCP ADD, RCP DELETE, RCP EDIT and RCP MOVE operate
  on entries only in the currently selected RCP file. 

  By default, the RCP file most recently created or opened using
  the CREATE RCP_FILE or OPEN RCP_FILE commands is selected as
  the current RCP file. 


3  SET

  FORMAT:		SET qualifier

  Valid qualifiers are:
  COLOUR, CURSOR_COLOUR, DEFAULT, DELAY, FC, FSN or LAYER

  FORMAT:		SET COLOUR overlay_colour

  Parameter:	overlay_colour
  The overlay colour.  An integer value in the range of 0 up to 7
  is required depending on the current PLANES setting.
  Alternatively the FRT keyword may be specified. 

  SET COLOUR determines the colour of any vector information
  subsequently output to Picture 2. The available colours are
  displayed in the legend. SET COLOUR FRT bases colour selection on
  the FRT lookup and is the default mode of operation. 
  The current overlay colour is displayed with the SHOW PARAMETERS
  command. 

  SET COLOUR  0 sets the overlay to the background colour, and may
  be used to selectively erase overlaid features in Picture 2. Note
  that if no information has been overlaid, setting the colour to 0
  will result in no information being drawn. 

4  CURSOR_COLOUR

  FORMAT:		SET CURSOR_COLOUR colour

  Parameter:	colour
  The colour of the cursor. An integer in the range of 1 to 2
  raised to the power n (where n is the current planes setting)
  should be supplied. The default value is 1. 

  This command allows the square raster editing cursor to be
  changed in colour. By default the cursor is drawn in colour 1 of
  the colour table which is black in the standard ROVER colour
  tables. Any of the current PICTURE 1 colours may however be
  selected using this command. 

4  DEFAULT

  FORMAT:		 SET DEFAULT RCP_WXY weight

  Parameter:             weight
  The RCP XY coordinate weight.  A real (floating) point value is
  required. 

  The SET DEFAULT RCP_WXY command allows a user to define the
  default RCP XY coordinate weight.  The weight value is used to
  assign a confidence factor to the RCP x and y coordinates. 

  The weight value will be automatically attached to a Registration
  Control Point when the RCP ADD is given, unless DISABLE DEFAULT
  RCP_WXY has been specified.  If the DISABLE DEFAULT RCP_WXY
  command has been given, the weight value will be supplied as a
  default value that may be accepted by pressing carriage return in
  response to the prompt 'Enter XY weight >'

  The RCP Z coordinate weight.  A real (floating) point value is
  required.

  The SET DEFAULT RCP_WZ command allows a user to define the
  default RCP Z coordinate weight.  The weight value is used to
  assign a confidence factor to the RCP Z coordinate. 

  The weight value will be automatically attached to a Registration
  Control Point when the RCP ADD is given, unless DISABLE DEFAULT
  RCP_Z has been specified.  If the DISABLE DEFAULT RCP_Z command
  has been given, the weight value will be supplied as a default
  value that may be accepted by pressing carriage return in
  response to the prompt 'Enter Z weight >' 

  The default RCP_WZ value is 0, unless a RCP Z coordinate has
  been specified, when a weighting value of 1.0 is assumed. 

  The current RCP_WZ value may be examined using the SHOW SETTINGS
  command when in REGISTRATION mode. 
 
5  RCP_Z

4	DELAY

  FORMAT:		SET DELAY delay_time

  Parameter:	delay_time
  The time delay in milliseconds. A positive integer is required. 
  The default value is 100.

  The SET DELAY command may be used to control the delay time
  between successive cursor updates on the screen.  If the cursor
  lags behind the movement of the mouse or trackerball, then
  the default  value of 100 milliseconds should be increased. 

  A suitable delay setting may depend on the size of the window
  displayed and also on the amount of graphics activity taking
  place on the workstation.

  The SETUP MAP command allows a source document to be registered
  to the currently selected DTI file. 
  In order to register the map and a DTI file , the file should
  have first been specified, and a source document should have been
  securely attached to the surface of a digitising table. 

  On giving the command you will be asked to digitise 4 rectangular
  registration points. The registration points represent 4 points
  on the map that correspond to the 4 corners of the DTI file. The
  points are digitised in the order top left (NW), bottom left
  (SW), bottom right (SE) and top right (NE) using any button on
  the table puck. A point should be digitised in response to a
  prompt on the terminal. 

  An error message is generated if any of the angles of the
  digitised rectangle are less than 88 degrees, or greater than 92
  degrees (ie. if the corner points of the rectangle are more than
  2 degrees off rectangular). In this case you will be asked to
  redigitise the 4 registration points. 
  Setup of the map may be aborted using <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl
  and Z keys together), or by pressing Button F on the table puck. 

  Following the registration of a map to the file , coordinate
  values required by the WINDOW and CENTRE commands, may be input
  using an appropriate button on the table puck. 
  Map registration also allows the DIGITISE mode of operation to be
  invoked with the ENABLE DIGITISE command. 
  If EDIT mode is enabled then cursor movement may be  achieved
  using table puck coordinate input.

  colour index are also displayed. 

4  DEVICE

  FORMAT:		 SHOW DEVICE

  Details of which DTI file is currently associated with which
  display quadrant are output to the terminal. The current viewing
  direction as specified by the ROTATE command is also output. 

4  ENABLE

  FORMAT:		 SHOW ENABLE

  Displays the current status of all the ROVER options that may be
  enabled or disabled using the ENABLE and DISABLE commands. 
  The name of the option is shown, followed by either the word ON
  or OFF to indicate its current status. 
  If the command SHOW ENABLE is used before any ENABLE or DISABLE
  commands have been given, the default status of the options is
  displayed. 

4  FILEIN

  FORMAT:		 SHOW FILEIN

  Details of the currently selected DTI file are displayed on the
  terminal. 
  The header values are shown in the current units of measurement. 
  This is dependent on the header type of the input file, or may
  be set explicitly using the UNITS command. By default or if the
  ENABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given then metre or projection
  values are expressed in absolute values. Otherwise they are
  displayed as offsets from the SW corner of the matrix. 

  The DTI file number as required by the SELECT FILEIN command is
  also displayed. 


4  IFF

  FORMAT:		 SHOW IFF

  The name of the IFF file, and the IFF coordinate range and window
  settings are shown. By default or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE command
  has been given,  then the coordinates are expressed as absolute
  values. Otherwise they are displayed as offset values from the SW
  corner of the file area. 

4  PARAMETERS

  FORMAT:		 SHOW PARAMETERS

  Details of the current range and step settings,step upper limits
  and associated colour indices are output for the currently
  selected DTI file. 

4  POSITION

  FORMAT:		 SHOW POSITION

  In EDIT mode SHOW POSITION outputs to the terminal the current
  editing cursor position.  The values are shown in the current
  units of measurement. By default or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE
  command has been given then metre or projection values are
  expressed in absolute values. Otherwise they are displayed as
  offsets from the SW corner of the matrix. The DTI value at this
  position is also shown. 

  In DIGITISE mode the command outputs the current position of the
  digitising cursor in IFF coordinates. 
  SHOW POSITION is only valid in DIGITISE or EDIT modes of
  operation. 

4  RANGES

  FORMAT:		 SHOW RANGES

  SHOW RANGES outputs information about value ranges for the
  currently selected DTI file to the terminal. The file range
  stored in the file header, the range of values in the current
  WINDOW, and the current range as specified with the RANGE command
  are shown. The WINDOW range may require to be calculated by this
  command. This may take an appreciable time for large windows. 

4  RCP_FILE

  FORMAT:		 SHOW RCP_FILE

  The SHOW RCP_FILE command is used to display the contents of the
  currently selected Registration Control Point (RCP) file. 

  An RCP file may be made current using the SELECT RCP_FILE
  command. By default the file most recently opened or created
  using the OPEN RCP_FILE and CREATE RCP_FILES commands, is
  selected as the current RCP file. 

4  SELECTIONS

  FORMAT:		 SHOW SELECTIONS

  The currently active selections made with the SELECT and DESELECT
  commands are listed. 

4  SETTINGS

  FORMAT:		 SHOW SETTINGS

  Displays the name of all ROVER parameters that may be set using
  the SET command, and their current values. 
  If the SHOW SETTINGS command is given before using a SET command,
  the values shown are the default values that are allocated to the
  parameters by ROVER. 


3  SMOOTH_EDIT

  FORMAT:		SMOOTH_EDIT

  SMOOTH_EDIT command specifies that the next editing sequence of
  commands will specify two lines between which DTI values will be
  interpolated. 
  A sequence of EDIT and MOVE commands are used to define the first
  line.  On issue of the END command the user is prompted for a DTI
  value. If no value is given (carriage return is pressed) the
  existing values of that line are assumed. The second line should
  then be specified in a similar way. On completion of the second
  line, values between the two lines are linearly interpolated. 
  Appropriate messages guide the user through the sequence of
  commands required. 

  The SMOOTH_EDIT command is only available in EDIT mode of
  operation. 
  To indicate that smooth editing is taking place the program
  prompt becomes 'Smooth>' during the editing operation. 
  ABANDON or <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl and Z keys together) will
  abort the  smooth editing operation operation. 
  Puck button D is defined to be SMOOTH_EDIT.

3  SPAWN

  FORMAT:		SPAWN command

  Parameter:	command
  The DCL command which is to be spawned. A Valid DCL command is
  required. 

  SPAWN allows a DCL command to be obeyed from within the ROVER
  program. This is to allow file management operations such as
  DIRECTORY, DELETE and RENAME to be carried out during program
  execution. 

3  SRI

  FORMAT:		SRI file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The SRI file specification. Any part of the file specification
  not supplied  will be taken from the default 'LSL$FRT:.SRI' 
  The specified SRI file is selected. The SRI determines the
  graphical representation of point symbols, and symbol strings. If
  this command is omitted before the OVERLAY command then an SRI
  with the same name as the supplied FRT will be opened. If such a
  file does not exist then this command is required before OVERLAY
  is issued. 

3  START

  FORMAT:		 START

  The construction of an IFF feature is started using the program's
  digitising option. A crosshair cursor will appear on the screen,
  and the prompt 'Digitise Point>' will be output on the terminal,
  to show that a feature is being constructed. 

  This command is only available in DIGITISE mode of operation.

  Puck button 4 is defined as START.

3  STEP

  FORMAT:		 STEP values[...]
	
  Parameters:	values
  One or more step interval values. Up to 7 non-integer integer
  values  may be specified. At least one value is required. 

  This command divides the values in the currently selected DTI
  file into a series of steps which are displayed in different
  colours. 
  One or more DTI step intervals may be defined using this command
  for the currently selected DTI file. A single value denotes a
  constant step interval, while a variable step interval may be
  defined by entering up to 7 values. 

  A constant step interval, derived by dividing the minimum and
  maximum values in the DTI file by the number of display colours,
  is set up by default on opening a DTI file. The COLOURS and
  FIRST_COLOUR commands also reset the STEP in this way. 
  If a single step value of 1 is given, then each step is
  associated with a single colour on display. The legend reflects
  this situation as each value is placed alongside the centre of
  each box. 

  If step intervals are set such that there are too few colours to
  display all the steps, then the upper steps will be displayed in
  white. 
  The colour index that will be associated with each step defined
  may by examined by means of the command SHOW PARAMETERS. 
  In EDIT mode this command causes automatic redisplay of the
  currently selected DTI file. 

3  TABLE

  Valid qualifier is:
  RCP_FILE

4  RCP_FILE

  FORMAT:         TABLE RCP_FILE number

  Parameters:	number
  The number of the RCP file.  An integer value in the range 1 to 4
  is required. 

  The TABLE RCP_FILE command is used to select the Registration
  Control Point (RCP) file into which RCPs recorded using the table
  puck and digitising table will be entered. 

  By default RCPs entered from the table will be added to the
  current RCP file selected using the SELECT RCP_FILE command,
  however the TABLE RCP_FILE command may be used to allocate a
  particular RCP file to the table.  This option, when utilised
  with the SETUP MAP command given in REGISTRATION mode, allows a
  user to enter map control points from the table, and image
  control points from the terminal or workstation mouse, without
  the need to redefine which RCP file is current. 


3  TOLERANCE

  FORMAT:		    TOLERANCE [a b c]
	
  Parameters:	    a,b,c
  The coefficients which control the spacing of the interpolated
  points. The defaults are a=250.0, b=0.0, c=0.0. Absence of
  trailing parameters will not affect the corresponding tolerances
  if these have been previously set. If no tolerance values are
  specified, or if the sum of the three tolerances is zero after
  the command has been issued, the default tolerances are set. 
	
  This command affects how interpolated lines are output with the
  OVERLAY command. 
  The three coefficients (a,b,c) control the spacing of
  interpolated points. The approximate separation of points (d) is
  given by: 

  	d = a + 2*SQRT(2br) + cr (r is radius of curvature)
	      
  which means (if other coefficients were zero ) that 

  	a gives a constant separation of A IFF units
  	b gives a constant 'arc to chord' distance of b IFF units
  	c gives a constant angular deviation of c radians

3  TRI

  FORMAT:		 TRI file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The TRI file specification. Any part of the specification not
  supplied is taken from the default 'LSL$FRT:.TRI'. 

  The specified TRI file is selected. The TRI file is used to
  determine the font characteristics of IFF text features drawn in
  Picture 2 using the OVERLAY command. 
  If this command is omitted before the OVERLAY command then a TRI
  with the same name as the supplied FRT will be opened. If such a
  file does not exist then this command is required before OVERLAY
  is issued. 

3  UNITS

  FORMAT:		UNITS units

  Parameter:	units
  A keyword defining the measurement units, chosen from: 

    MATRIX	Matrix grid interval units, i.e rows and
			columns 
    METRES	Metre offsets from the south west corner
  		of the DTI file 
    SECONDS     Latitude and Longitude in seconds of arc 
    LATLONG	Latitude and Longitude in degrees,
		minutes and seconds 
    PROJECTION  Projection Record Units (eg. mms on the
  		source document) 

  The UNITS command defines the units of measurement that will be
  used when defining an area of interest in the currently selected
  DTI file  by means of the WINDOW command, and for specifying the
  editing cursor position with the MOVE command 
  The command also controls in what format details from the header
  of the DTI file  are displayed, when the SHOW FILEIN command is
  given. 
  The command should be given after defining the an DTI file  since
  an appropriate default units of measurement is set up when the
  file is opened. 

3  UP

  FORMAT:		UP

  UP moves the raster editing cursor up by one DTI pixel.
  The command is only available if ENABLE EDIT has been specified.
  Puck button 9 is defined as UP.

3  UPDATE_FILEIN

  FORMAT:	        UPDATE_FILEIN  file-spec

  Parameter:	file-spec
  The file specification for the input DTI file. Any part of the
  file specification not supplied is taken from the default
  'LSL$DTI:DTI.DTI' 

  This command opens and maps into memory a DTI file for write
  access. The file is opened on the lowest available DTI file
  number.  The DTI file number is displayed on the terminal, and is
  the means by which the file is selected when a number of DTI
  files are opened. 
  Up to 4 DTI files may be opened at one time.  By default the DTI
  file opened with the last FILEIN or UPDATE_FILEIN command is the
  current DTI file.
  If the logical name LSL$MATRIX_DEFAULT_WINDOW is defined with a
  value of "1", then a default area of interest is set for the file
  based on the maximum window which may be displayed in the default
  display area on the graphics device at four times magnification. 
  Otherwise a window corresponding to the entire file extents is
  set unless this is too large to be displayed in which case
  truncation takes place. 
  The area of interest may be altered at 	any time by use
  of the WINDOW command. 
  Information on the mapped DTI file may be obtained at any time by
  typing 'SHOW FILEIN' 
  This command is required if editing operations are to be carried
  out on the file. (cf FILEIN) 
  In EDIT mode issue of the UPDATE_FILEIN command results in
  automatic display of the file. 

3  WAIT

  FORMAT:		 WAIT interval

  Parameter:	 interval
  The interval of time in seconds. A real value is required.

  This command suspends program execution for the specified time
  interval. It is useful for demonstration purposes if ROVER is
  being run from a command file. 

3  WINDOW

  FORMAT:		WINDOW  xmin ymin xmax ymax

  Parameters:	xmin, ymin
  The coordinates of the bottom left hand corner of the defining
  rectangle. 

  		xmax, ymax
  The coordinates of top right hand corner of the defining
  rectangle. 

  UNITS MATRIX -  Requires 4 integer values defining the rectangle
  		  in terms of column and row numbers 

  UNITS METRES -  Requires 4 real (floating point) values defining
  		  the rectangle as metre offsets from the SW corner
  		  of the DTI file. 

  UNITS SECONDS - Requires 4 real (floating point) values defining
  		  the absolute position of the rectangle in seconds
  		  of arc. The values are supplied in the order
  		  latitude followed by longitude for the SW corner,
  		  and latitude followed by longitude for the NE
  		  corner.  A negative latitude value indicates a
         	  position in the Southern Hemisphere, and a
  		  negative longitude value a point to the west of
  		  Greenwich. 

  UNITS LATLONG - Requires 4 values defining the absolute latitude
  		  and longitude position of the rectangle in the
  		  format DDD MM SS H where DDD is the number of
  		  degrees, MM is the number of minutes, SS is the
  		  number of seconds, and H is the hemisphere
  		  (N,S,E,W). The values are supplied in the order
  		  latitude followed by longitude for the SW corner,
  		  and latitude followed by longitude for the NE
  		  corner. 

  UNITS PROJECTION - Requires 4 real (floating point) values defining
  		     the rectangle in projection record units.  By
  		     default, or if the ENABLE ABSOLUTE command has
  		     been given, the values are absolute coordinates;
  		     if the DISABLE ABSOLUTE command has been given,
  		     then the coordinates are offsets from the SW
  		     corner of the matrix. 

  Note that in all cases, the input values are adjusted
  to the nearest column and row values. 

  The WINDOW command is used to limit display to a particular
  rectangular geographical area.  Only nodes in the DTI file that
  lie within this area are drawn when the DISPLAY command is given.
  The area of interest should lie within the geographical bounds of
  the DTI file. 

  If the logical name LSL$MATRIX_DEFAULT_WINDOW is defined with a
  value of "1", then a default area of interest is set for the file
  based on the maximum window which may be displayed in the default
  display area on the graphics device at four times magnification. 
  Otherwise a window corresponding to the entire file extents is
  set unless this is too large to be displayed in which case
  truncation takes place. 

  If a digitising table is available, and a map has been registered
  to the DTM, the coordinates of the window may be defined using
  any button on the table puck. 
  In EDIT mode issue of this command causes immediate redisplay of
  the new window. 

3  ZOOM

  FORMAT:		 ZOOM [factor]
	
  Parameter:	 factor
  The zoom factor. A positive real number may be specified. If no
  parameter is given then the default zoom factor is 2. 

  ZOOM resets the current raster and IFF windows depending on the
  zoom factor. The default zoom factor is two. This halves the size
  of the window, and therefore increases the scale of the displayed
  image. A scale factor of between 0 and 1 increases the size of
  the window. In EDIT mode the new window is centred around the
  current DTI cursor coordinates. 
  If many ZOOM commands will be used during a Rover session then it
  is recommended that the colour mapping option is invoked with the
  ENABLE COLOUR_MAP command. This improves the efficiency of
  raster display.
