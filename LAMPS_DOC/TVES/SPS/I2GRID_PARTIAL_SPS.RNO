.BR;^^^*MODULE I2GRID\*

.P0; I2GRID is a module to convert data from Laser-Scan's Internal Feature
Format (IFF) to Laser-Scan's Digital Terrain Image (DTI) format.  In so doing
the data is converted from a VECTOR to a GRID (raster) form; ie. the data in the
input IFF file is rasterised. 

.P 0
In its rasterised form, the data may be manipulated and displayed using many
of the modules that form part of the Laser-Scan TVES and MATRIX packages.

.P 0
The module does not require a graphics device.

.P 0; The main features of I2GRID are:
.LIST "o"
.LE; Vector to raster conversion of the whole or part of an IFF file

.LE; Output of converted data to a new or existing grid file

.LE; Selection of which feature attribute is stored
in the output grid file (eg. feature code, height)

.LE; Output of the data at any grid resolution (dependent on the 
application of the imagery)

.LE; Conversion of point, line and area information

.LE; Selection of which IFF features are converted on the basis of
feature code, FSN or layer

.LE; User control over the order in which features are converted

.LE; Mechanism to allow preset attribute values to be associated with
selected features

.LE; On-line help, and friendly command interface using user defined
lookup and feature representation tables.
