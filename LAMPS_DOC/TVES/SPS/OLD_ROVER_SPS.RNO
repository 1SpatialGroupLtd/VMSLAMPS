.HL 1 ^&General Description\&
ROVER is a Laser-Scan program which displays both grid based and vector
geographic data, and allows a user to interact with the displayed information. 
.BL
The grid and vector data may be displayed independently, but more importantly
they may also be displayed together using the program. The user is able to
derive considerable benefits from this integrated display:
.LIST
.LE;in the areas of data validation and visualisation 
.LE;through the derivation of other geographic information from the combined
datasets. 
.END LIST
.P 0
ROVER provides a display link between Laser-Scan programs that manipulate
and display grid and vector datasets.  The Laser-Scan programs that either
generate or utilise digital elevation models (DEMs), namely PANACEA (used for
DEM generation), DTE (used for editing grid data), SLOPES (used to derive and
display slope and aspect information from a DEM) and COVER (used to calculate
intervisibility) are of particular relevance, along with Laser-Scan's vector
cartographic editor (LITES2) and plotting program (FPP).  The program I2GRID
offers vector to raster conversion, while the program VECTORISE enables
raster information to be converted to a Laser-Scan vector format.
.P 0
.HL 1 ^&SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS\&
ROVER is built under VAX VMS version 4.
.P 0
.HL1 ^&Device Requirements\&
The program runs on any DEC VAX-11 series computer, or DEC 
MicroVax computer.
.P 0
The program is designed to utilise a SIGMA ARGS 7000 colour display, configured
with a minimum of 8 bit-planes.  A VAX/GPX workstation version is currently
under development. 
.P 0
An Altek Datatab Digitising Table (or similar LSL approved digitising table),
16 button puck, and the associated Laser-Scan Table Monitor System, are
required if source document registration and the digitising options within the
program are to be utilised. 
.P 0
A DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal is required for command input.
.Hl1 ^&Data File Requirements\&
The program reads raster or grid information from a Laser-Scan
Digital Terrain Image (DTI) file.  Programs to convert elevation information
from other grid formats exist, while a number of Laser-Scan programs eg.
SLOPES, are able to produce output DTI files that may be subsequently displayed
using ROVER.  The program I2GRID is available to convert vector information
into a grid DTI format. The DTI format is documented in the document DTITECH.
.P 0
The program displays vector information from a Laser-Scan Internal
Feature Format (IFF) file.  The IFFLIB document contains details of the IFF
format and associated library routines. 
.HL 1 ^&FACILITIES\&
.P 0
The main features of the program are:
.LIST
.LE; Full or quartered screen display
.LE; Image zoom and roam under cursor control
.LE; User control over allocation of device bit-planes between the
raster and vector pictures.
.LE; Selective manipulation and display of raster and vector pictures
.LE; User control over colour tables (defining nature of raster display
colours and vector overlay colours)
.LE; Ability to annotate the display with legend, and user specified
text 
.LE; Source document registration to grid or vector data
.LE; Ability to digitise to an output IFF file, using the displayed
information as a guide
.LE; Command input via keyboard, or puck button.
.LE; On-line help and full user documentation.
