.BR;^^^*MODULE VECTORISE\*

.P0; The module VECTORISE allows grid based data (raster) to be converted into
a vector IFF representation. Lines generated from the raster image by VECTORISE
are the boundaries between areas in the grid file whose pixel values fall into
user defined ranges. The input grid file may contain a variety of geographic
information ranging from elevation or slope data to remotely-sensed satellite
imagery.

.P0; The main features of VECTORISE are:

.LE; Output into a link-node structured IFF file

.LE; Vector boundary generation

.LE; Optional smoothing of the vector boundary data

.LE; Progress and diagnostic display 

.LE; On-line help and full user documentation
