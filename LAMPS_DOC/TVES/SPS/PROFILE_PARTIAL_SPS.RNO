.BR;^^^*MODULE PROFILE\*

.P 0;The module PROFILE is used to construct a series of path profile lines
through a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). Typically, the origin of the profiles
will be a base station, and the profile data will be used for radio frequency
propagation analysis. Profiles are constructed either radially around the base
station, or between each DTM node and the base station.  Options are provided
in the program to restrict profile generation to a rectangular area of
interest, or to a sector of interest. 

.P 0;Input is a DTM, and optionally a series of clutter grid files, held in
a Laser-Scan Digital Terrain Image (DTI) format. The DTM defines the
elevation of the terrain surface, while the clutter grid file contains
height information relating to surface features such as buildings, vegetation
or water. Output is to a Laser-Scan vector Internal Feature Format (IFF) file.

.P 0;Each profile is written to the IFF file as a separate feature. The
bearing and length of the profile is stored in the IFF file, along with the 
x, y and z coordinates of the profile sample points. Additionally a clutter
index value is stored for each sample point. 

The main features of the program are:

.LIST "o"
.LE; Registration of the DTM to a source document positioned on a
digitising table, and command input from the table puck

.LE; Optional use of information on the height of surface features such as
buildings and vegetation

.LE; Construction of profiles either radially around the base station,
or between the base station and each DTM node

.LE; Use of a constant sample interval or sample interval that varies with
the distance of the sample point from the base station

.LE; Restriction of profile generation to a rectangular area of interest, or
to a sector of interest in the DTM 

.LE; Coordinate input in matrix, metres or latlong units.

.LE; On-line help and full user documentation
