.HL 1 ^^^&INTRODUCTION\&
.P 0
The DIGITAL TERRAIN EDITOR (DTE),
allows a digital terrain matrix (DTM) to be displayed in plan as a colour coded
height layered image, and has facilities that allow a user to interactively
interrogate and edit the elevation data. 
.P 0
The area of the DTM available for editing and display is selected via the
WINDOW command, while display height and colour allocation is determined using
the STEP, COLOURS and LIMITS commands. Edits are performed directly to the DTM
using the EDIT, POLYEDIT, PATHEDIT or INTERPEDIT options. 
.P 0
The program offers the opportunity to pan and zoom the display
image, the means to generate a contour map from the terrain matrix
data, the option to produce a histogram showing the distribution of
elevation points and the ability to flood the terrain.
.PAGE
.HL 1 ^^^&DTE DEVICE REQUIREMENTS\&
.P 0
The program has been designed to run on a TVES configured workstation,
consisting of an Altek digitising table, SIGMA ARGS 7000 colour display,
TEKTRONIX 4014 and an alpha-numeric terminal. However, the program can be
run on a minimum of a SIGMA ARGS 7000 with alpha-numeric terminal.
.P 0
The use of the table is optional, but allows the user to register a source
document to the input DTM and also control the FLOOD command. In order to
utilise the table, the TABLE MONITOR needs to be active and must be
successfully initialised by the program. If table initialisation fails a
warning message is given but the program will continue. The program can also
optionally use the SIGMA TRACKERBALL and FUNCTION BUTTONS. 
.P 0
The SIGMA ARGS is used to display the colour coded DTM, or a histogram
showing the distribution of heights in the DTM if the BARCHART command
is issued.
.P 0
The Tektronix display (if selected) is used to display a plot showing the
extent of the DTM in a pecked line, the current window in a solid line, and the
area of the DTM currently displayed on the SIGMA in a refresh line.  This
latter area will vary in position and size as the SIGMA display is magnified,
reduced or recentred via the ENLARGE, REDUCE and CENTRE commands. The Tektronix
is also used to display a contour map generated from the DTM via the
CONTOURWINDOW or CONTOURMAP commands. 
.P 0
The TRACKERBALL is used to move the cursor around the current window and
control the FLOOD command. A movement of the TRACKERBALL is equivalent to the
MOVE command from the table or keyboard. The 4 function buttons can be used to
issue the commands listed below. 
.P 0
The alphanumeric terminal is used to display edit and DTM information,
in the following format:
.LIT

DTI FILE      : LSL$DTI:FILE.DTI

FILE X RANGE     :     1 -  1100    WINDOW X RANGE  :   200 -   700
FILE Y RANGE     :     1 -  1000    WINDOW Y RANGE  :   150 -   550
FILE H RANGE     :     0 -  1340    WINDOW H RANGE  :   456 -   782

CURSOR HEIGHT    :   520            HEIGHT LIMITS   :   300 -  1000
CURSOR POSITION  :   250 -   450    HEIGHT STEP     :    25
.END LIT
.HL 1 ^^^&OTHER REQUIREMENTS\&
.P 0
The program requires the digital elevation data to be stored in Laser Scan's
Digital Terrain Image (DTI) file format.  Conversion programs to translate DTMs
from other formats to a DTI format exist. 
.P 0
For correct colour display on the SIGMA ARGS the colour look-up-tables
'DTECOL.DAT' and 'DTESHADES.DAT' (for the MODTEN option) should be present in
LSL$IDYSDIR. Colour look-up-tables can be changed during program execution
using the LUT command. To utilise the VT command the logical name LSL$VSALPHA
needs to be set up to point to the terminal line of the SIGMA Alpha plane.

.PAGE
.HL 1 ^^^&COMMAND INPUT\&
.P 0
Command input is via the terminal in response to the prompt DTE >, via
the command menu if the DTE menu has been positioned on the table
using the MENUSET command, by cursor puck button, or by function button 
(if available).
.P 0
A list of all valid DTE commands may be obtained at any time by typing HELP
from within the program.
.P 0
Details of the format and purpose of individual commands may be printed
on the terminal by typing HELP followed by the command name.
.LIT

The following commands are defined:


ABANDON		BARCHART	CENTRE		COLOURS
CONTOURMAP	CONTOURWINDOW	DOWN		EDIT
END		ENLARGE		EXIT		FLOOD
FILE		LUT		INTERPEDIT      LEFT
LIMITS		MAPSET		MENU		MODTEN
MOVE		PATHEDIT	POLYEDIT	RANGE
REDUCE		RIGHT		STEP		TEKTRONIX
UP		VT		WINDOW


The 16 buttons on the table puck are defined as follows:


        MOVE      CENTRE    ENLARGE   REDUCE

	LEFT       RIGHT      UP       DOWN

        EDIT     POLYEDIT   ABANDON     END 

      PATHEDIT  INTERPEDIT  BARCHART  WINDOW


The 4 function buttons on the TRACKERBALL box are defined as follows:

	ENLARGE	  REDUCE    CENTRE    EDIT


.END LIT
Puck button input is interpreted in the following way: (in order of
priority)
.LIST
.LE;to control the level of  flooding if FLOOD command has been issued
.LE;a single digit if an integer argument is expected
.LE;a menu command if the recorded point lies within the DTE menu 
.LE;a DTM matrix coordinate together with a puck button command if the point
is within the DTM map area
.LE;a puck-button command 
.END LIST
.P 0
Commands that take one or more numerical arguments:
.LIST
.LE;if issued via the terminal keyboard the arguments may follow the command on
the command line.  If omitted the user will be prompted for values. 
.LE;if issued via the menu, then a prompt for the arguments will be output
to the terminal
.LE;if issued using a puck button and the cursor is positioned within the
DTM map area, the coordinates of the point (transformed to DTM matrix values)
are taken as the argument. If no map has been registered to the matrix, a
prompt for the arguments will be output to the terminal. 
.END LIST
.P 0
In all cases single integer arguments (eg. a DTM height) may be input via
the puck buttons (using ABANDON to delete the last digit, and END
to enter the integer value).
.P 0
Note: When prompted for a DTM matrix coordinate, if the map is located on the
table the MOVE and CENTRE buttons will only move the SIGMA cursor, while any
other buttons will move the cursor and also submit a point for input. 
.P 0
Menu and puck button commands which take a logical argument
act as flip-flops.
.P 0
All argument inputs are acknowledged with a single bell.
.P 0
.HL 1 ^^^&RUNNING THE PROGRAM\&
.P 0
The program is run by typing DTE optionally followed by a DTI filename.
.P 0
If no filename is supplied on the DCL command line, a file must be selected
by means of the FILE command.
.P 0
Following file definition, it is necessary to define an area of interest
by means of the WINDOW command.  This window cannot exceed the limits of
the DTM or the screen display area of 1024 x 1024.
.PAGE
.HL 1 ^^^&USER GUIDE SYNTAX\&
This guide presents a list of all DTE commands in alphabetical order,
followed by a detailed description of the syntax and purpose of each command.
In presenting the format of each command the following is employed: 
.P 0

				     height interval ]
				   [     n     n     ]

Displays a contour map of the whole DTM area on the
Tektronix 4014. The contours are derived from the DTM.

The contour interval is determined by the 'height interval',
while the 'sampling interval' controls how many DTM points
are considered by the contouring algorithm.
Increasing the sample interval will increase the speed of
contouring, but may result in a poorer contour map.

This command may be aborted during execution by CTRL/C

.END LIT
.HL 2 CONTOURWINDOW

		Format:
			CONTOURWINDOW [ sampling interval,
					height interval ]
				      [      n     n    ]	

Displays a contour map covering the current DTM edit window.
The contours are derived from the DTM, and are drawn
on the TEKTRONIX 4014.

The contour interval is determined by the 'height interval',
while the 'sampling interval' controls how many DTM points
are considered by the contouring algorithm.
Increasing the sample interval will increase the speed of
contouring, but may result in a poorer contour map.

This command can be aborted during execution by CTRL/C.

.END LIT
.HL 2 DOWN
.LIT

.HL 2 FLOOD
.LIT

		Format:
			[+/-] FLOOD [ time interval ]
				    [      r        ]

[+] FLOOD 
Floods visible window between current height limits (using current step
interval). The command takes an optional real argument which controls
the time interval (in seconds) between the flooding of each level. If
a time interval is given the current window is flooded and drained.
Movement of the TRACKERBALL or PUCK (in Y axis) after the flooding has 
finished will control the level of flooding until a new FILE or WINDOW
is defined or the -FLOOD command is issued. If no argument (or time
interval of zero [0] ) is given then the user has immediate interactive 
control of the flooding limits. Warnings are given when the upper and
lower limits of flooding are reached.

- FLOOD 
Returns TRACKERBALL and PUCK movement to non-flood state leaving present
level of flooding.

Valid time intervals are between 0 (zero) and 10 (ten) seconds.
