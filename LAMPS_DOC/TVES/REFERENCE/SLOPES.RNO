.LM +10
SLOPES is a program to produce a slope, aspect, height difference or shaded
relief map from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The various maps may be
output either to a colour graphics display, or to a Laser Scan DTI (Digital
Terrain Image) disk file. 
.P 0
In the slope and height difference options, the user may specify the value step
interval and the value and height range within which the information is
displayed. In the shaded image option, the user has control over the sun
position and sun angle. For aspect maps the user may vary the size of the
angular step, and may display the information either as a grey scale or
colour image.

.HL 1 ^*DESCRIPTION\*
.lm +8
SLOPES is a program to produce a slope, aspect, height difference or shaded
relief map from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The various images may be
output either to a colour graphics display, or to a DTI disk file. 



.lm -8

^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*Slope and Aspect Calculation\*
.lm +8
The two components of the local gradient are slope and aspect (the direction
of slope). Both derivatives may be calculated and displayed using SLOPES. 
.P 0
The user may select from 5 different slope algorithms. 4 algorithms provide a
measure of average slope based on the slope of adjacent parts of the terrain,
while the fifth algorithm provides a measure of maximum slope.  The algorithm
is selected using the integer parameter associated with the ^*SLOPE\* command.
.P 0
The default slope algorithm is number 1.  This algorithm employs a 3 X 3
operator that is passed over the matrix column by column and row by row.  The
operator calculates the slope at the centre point of the matrix. This is done
by calculating the change in slope in the x and y direction for the
surrounding matrix points, and combining the x and y components to provide an
average measure of slope.

			Z-o       Zoo       Z+o



			z--       Zo-       Z+-


The algorithm used is:

	P = [(Z++ + 2Z+o + Z+-) - (Z-+ + 2Z-o + Z--)] / 8dx 

	Q = [(Z++ + 2Zo+ + Z-+) - (Z+- + 2Zo- + Z--)] / 8dy 

Where:
	P    slope in the x direction (west to east)
	Q    slope in the y direction (south to north)
	dx   grid interval in the x direction
	dy   grid interval in the y direction
	
.END LIT
The remaining algorithms are based on the division of the terrain matrix into
a number of regular triangular facets, and the calculation of the surface
normal vector for each facet. The slope of a facet is the angle between the
surface normal and the vertical. 
.P 0
Algorithm 2 calculates an average slope value for a grid cell using
the elevation values for the matrix points at the corner of the cell.
.LIT

			Z-+        Z++


			
			Z--        Z+-


.END LIT
The cell is divided into 2 triangular facets defined by the nodes Z--, Z+-,
Z++ and Z++, Z-+, Z--.  The average slope value for the cell is produced
by meaning the slope for the 2 facets.
.P 0
Algorithm 3 uses the same technique but attempts to remove the directional
bias inherent in the previous algorithm by dividing the cell into 4 triangular
facets.  The 4 facets are defined by the nodes: Z--, Z++, Z-+ ; Z--, Z+-, Z++
; Z-+, Z--, Z+- ; Z-+, Z-+, Z++.  The average slope value for the cell is
produced by meaning the slope for the 4 facets.
.P 0
Algorithm 4 is based on a 3 X 3 matrix and involves the calculation of 
4 surface normal vectors.

.END LIT
An average slope value for the matrix node Zoo is derived by meaning the
slope values for the 4 triangles: Zoo, Zo+, Z-o ; Zoo, Z+o, Zo+ ; Zoo,
Zo-, Z+- ; Zoo, Z-o, Z--. 
.P 0
Algorithm 5 is identical to the previous algorithm, except that the maximum
of the 4 facet slopes is output rather than the mean value.
.BL 2
The slope values are calculated by default as degrees of slope, however using
the command ^*ENABLE PERCENT\* it is possible to output the derived slope
value as a percentage slope.  In the former case the slope values will be in
the range 0 to 90 degrees; in the second case the slope values will be output
in the range 0 to 100_%.

^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*Shade Calculation\*
.lm +8
A greyscale shaded overlay or relief map is an effective way of visualising
elevation data, enabling the viewer to readily perceive the form and trend of
surface relief. 
.P 0
The shaded overlay is produced by modelling the terrain surface as though lit
by a light source. The grey levels in the shaded overlay reflect the apparent
brightness of a surface element. This in turn is dependent upon its
orientation with respect to the light source.  A surface normal to the light
source will appear brighter than a surface facing away from the light source. 
The orientation of a surface is a product of the local gradient (ie. its
direction and slope). 
.P 0
It should be noted that the apparent brightness is a function only of the
local gradient.  No account is taken of effects dependent on the position
of the surface element with respect to other elements of the DTM eg. mutual
illumination or shadowing. Taking into account such factors can detract from
the visual quality of the shaded image, and make interpretation more
difficult. 
.P 0
The appearance of the final shaded image is dependent on the position of the
light source.  The position of the light source is defined in terms of an
elevation angle (zenith angle), and an azimuth angle.  The two angles are
defined using the commands ^*SUN__ANGLE\* and ^*SUN__POSITION\*. The azimuth
angle is measured clockwise from north. 
.P 0
By default a zenith angle of 45 degrees, and an azimuth angle of 315
degrees (north-west) are assumed. This is the light source position
that is most frequently used when hill shading is manually generated by
a cartographer.  
.P 0
Incorporated within SLOPES are 3 reflectance maps, which describe how a
surface reflects and absorbs light. The different reflectance maps may be
selected using the ^*REFLECTANCE__MAP\* command.  The default reflectance map
(number 2) uses a Lambertian surface model, in which the apparent brightness of
a surface facet is directly related to the cosine of the incident angle.
.P 0
Since the computation of the grey level using the cosine of the incident angle
is expensive, a piecewise linear approximation developed by Peucker is also
incorporated into SLOPES. The approximation is computed using an elevation
angle of 45 degrees and an azimuth angle of 315 degrees, and may be selected
the command REFLECTANCE__MAP 1. The third reflectance map developed by Wiechel
also assumes a Lambertian surface, but utilises an approximation to the cosine
of the incident angle, again in order to improve performance.
.p 0
The range of slopes, in other than a particularly mountainous region,
is often so small as to produce a disappointing shaded image with little
contrast.  Exaggerating the height values, using the ^*ZSCALE\* command,
prior to calculating the components of the local gradient, has the effect
of exaggerating the slope component, and leads to a image with more
contrast in areas of low relief.  A similar effect can be generated by
decreasing the elevation of the light source.

.P 0
^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*Height Difference Calculation\*
.lm +8
A height difference map may be output using the command
^*HEIGHT__DIFFERENCE\*. The map may be used to give an indication of terrain
roughness, or may be used to validate the height matrix (eg. to detect
abnormally large or small matrix values).  
.p 0
The algorithm uses a 3 X 3 operator that is passed over the matrix column by
column and row by row.  The operator calculates a height difference for the
centre point of the matrix by calculating the absolute difference between

.END LIT
point Zoo and the 8 surrounding points. By default, an average height value is
output, derived by meaning the 8 height difference values, however if the
^*DISABLE AVERAGE\* command has been given, then the maximum of the 8 values
is output. 
.LM -8
.P 0
^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*Output Map Parameters\*
.lm +8
The content of the SLOPE, ASPECT and HEIGHT DIFFERENCE maps is controlled
using the commands ^*ANGLE__INTERVAL\*, ^*STEP\*, ^*VALUE__RANGE\* and
^*ZLIMITS\*. 
.P 0
ANGLE__INTERVAL is used to define the angular step value for ASPECT 
calculation. For example, if an angular step value of 90 degrees is used,
then 4 different classes will be distinguished, with those parts of the 
terrain which have a direction of 0 to 90 degrees measured clockwise from
north (ie. between north and east) being assigned to class 1.  The default
angular interval is 30 degrees.
.P 0
VALUE__RANGE is used to define lower and upper limits of output slope or
height difference values.  For example, using the command VALUE__RANGE 0 30 it
is possible to restrict slope display to those slopes that lie between 0 and
30 degrees. When output is to a graphics device, matrix points outside the
value range will appear in black; when output is to a DTI file, matrix points
outside the value range are assigned a null value. 
.P 0
The STEP command is used to define the slope or height difference class
interval.  If a single integer value is supplied with the command, a constant
class interval is defined.  For example, the command STEP 10 when applied to a
slope map, will classify the slopes into 10 degree classes.  Alternatively, a
variable class interval may be defined by supplying a number of integer
arguments with the STEP command. For example, the command STEP 5 8 10 when
applied to a slope map, and assuming a value range of 0 to 40, will result in
5 classes of slope being distinguished with class upper limits of 5 13 23 33
40.  Note the final step value is used to fill out the remainder of the value
range. When output is to a graphics device, each class will appear in a
different colour. 
.p0
In addition to restricting the display of slope or height difference values to
a particular value range, it is also possible using the ZLIMITS command, to
restrict calculation to matrix points within a particular height range. For
example, if the command ZLIMITS 0 200 is given, then only matrix points that
fall within this height range, will be used in the slope, aspect or height
difference calculations. When output is to a graphics device, matrix points
outside the height range will appear in white. 
.p 0
The default value of these parameters may be examined using the commands
^*SHOW ASPECT\*, ^*SHOW HEIGHT__DIFFERENCE\*, ^*SHOW SHADE\* and ^*SHOW
SLOPE\*, while the default values may be selected using the commands
^*DEFAULT ASPECT\*, ^*DEFAULT HEIGHT__DIFFERENCE\*, ^*DEFAULT SHADE\* and
^*DEFAULT SLOPE\*.
.LM -8
.P 0
^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*DTI File Output and Graphics Display\*
.lm +8
It is possible to output a SLOPE, ASPECT, HEIGHT DIFFERENCE or SHADE map
either directly to a colour graphics device or to an output DTI file.  The
latter option is usually selected if the derived information is to be
displayed as a raster backdrop within LITES2, or if further processing such
as the vector extraction of slope boundaries is required.  Note that it
is possible to output both to a graphics device and to a DTI file
simultaneously.
.p 0;The command ^*FILEOUT\* is used to specify the name of the output DTI
file.  The output file is created with the same header as the input DTM, and
any header or projection information is transferred to the output file.  It is
possible to specify the format of the data values in the output DTI file using
the command ^*DATA__TYPE\*. By default an output value is held as a 16 bit
word. 
.P 0
The derived values are by default output to the DTI file in an unclassified
form, and any class values that may have been defined are not used.
It is however possible to output the class value, rather than the actual
derived value, by giving the command ^*ENABLE CLASSIFY\* prior to generating the
output map.  If this command is given, then it is the colour index that would
be used to display the value on a graphics device that is output.  For 
example, a slope value of 15 degrees which lies in the second class, would
be output as 2 with CLASSIFY enabled, and as 15 if CLASSIFY is disabled.
The COLOURS command may be used to control the index value that is output
to the file.
.P 0
The command ^*ENABLE GRAPHICS\* is used to direct output to the workstation
graphics device.  If this option is selected then the derived slope, aspect,
height difference or shade data is displayed on the screen, in a classified
colour coded or greyscale image, as it is calculated.  The way in which the
derived data is classified and appears to the user on the screen, is 
controlled using the output map parameters, along with the commands ^*LUT\*,
and ^*COLOURS\*.
.P 0
The colours used for the display of the classified information are defined
in a colour lookup table.  2 colour tables are supplied with the program,
and may be found in a directory which forms part of the search list
LSL$LOOKUP.  By default the colour table 'SLOPES.DAT' is used for slope,
height difference and colour aspect maps, and the colour table 'GREY.DAT'
for shade or aspect greyscale maps.  
.P 0
The contents of these files may be edited to change the RGB definitions of
particular colour indices, alternatively the LUT command may be used to read a
user specified colour table.  The optional qualifier on the LUT command is
used to associate a colour table with a particular type of map eg. the command
LUT SLOPES MYTABLE.DAT will cause this colour table to be used in preference
to the default colour table 'SLOPES.DAT'.
.P 0
The COLOURS command may be used to assign a colour index to a particular
class.  For example the command COLOUR 1 5 6 will assign colours 1 5 6 to
classes 1 2 and 3.
.P 0
By default the screen is cleared of any existing image whenever an ASPECT,
SLOPE, HEIGHT__DIFFERENCE or SHADE command is given.  The command ^*DISABLE
CLEAR\* may be used to disable the clearing of the screen between image
generation.  It is often useful to do this to demonstrate the relationship
between SLOPE, ASPECT and SHADE, and to see the effect of visualising the
terrain as a shaded relief map with different light source parameters.
.LM -8
.P 0
^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*Display Annotation\*
.lm +8
When using a graphics device, the display is by default annotated with a
legend and text. The legend allows the different colours used in the map to be
related to the value class interval.  The text displayed on the lower part of
the screen provides details on the input DTM, and the output map parameters. 
The text will vary depending on the type of derived information contained in
the map. 
.P 0
Display of a legend is controlled by means of the commands ^*DISABLE / ENABLE
LEGEND\* and ^*LEGEND POSITION\*.  The ^*DISABLE / ENABLE TEXT\* commands may
be used to control whether informational text is output to the screen. 
.P 0
In addition to the annotation described above, the map may be annotated with
user information by means of the command ^*DRAW LABEL\*. There is no
restriction on the number of labels that may be drawn, however a single text
string cannot consist of more than 80 characters. The ^*LABEL POSITION\*
command determines the position of the label on the screen; a label is drawn
so that the first character is located at the current label position.  The
^*LABEL SIZE\* command may be used to select from 4 different character sizes.
The command ^*CLEAR LABEL\* may be used to delete user annotation from the
screen. 
.LM -8
.P 0
^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL2 ^*Use of a Digitising Table, Table Puck and Menu\*
.lm +8
If your workstation incorporates a digitising table, then it is possible to
register a source document such as a map to the DTM, and to issue many of the
SLOPES commands from a table menu. 
.P 0 
If the logical name LSL$AUTO__ENABLE__TABLE is defined with a value of "1" the
program will attempt to initialise the Laser Scan Table Monitor Utility on
startup.  If the logical name is absent or has any other value, initialisation
is not performed on startup, however the table can be subsequently initialised
using the command ENABLE TABLE. 
.p0
The Table Monitor controls reading from the digitising table. It must be set
up on your system if SLOPES is to take input from the digitising table.  If
table initialisation fails then the message: 
.LIT

	*** WARNING *** Initialising table monitor
	SLOPES will assume no table is available

.END LIT
will be output before the prompt ^*SLOPES>\* is displayed on the terminal. In
the event of failure, input from the digitising table or puck button is not
possible, and the program will accept commands only from the terminal. 
.P 0
Table initialisation will generally fail because no Table Monitor is currently
active, or because the Table Monitor is locked by another user. If neither of
these reasons appear to apply, you should consult the TABLIB Reference Manual,
or seek guidance from your system manager.
.BL 2
A map is registered to the DTM using the command ^*SETUP MAP\*.  Before giving
this command you should have first selected the input DTM, and have securely
attached the source document to the digitising table. 
.P0;Registration is performed by digitising 4 rectangular registration points.
The registration points represent 4 points on the map that correspond to the 4
corners of the DTM.  The points are digitised in the order top left (NW),
bottom left (SW), bottom right (SE) and top right (NE) using any button on the
table puck. A point is digitised in response to an explanatory prompt on the
terminal. 
.p0; An error message is generated if any of the angles of the digitised
rectangle are less than 88 degrees, or greater than 92 degrees (ie. if the
corner points of the rectangle are more than 2 degrees off rectangular). In
this situation you will be asked to redigitise the 4 registration points.
.P0; Once a map has been positioned on the table, it is possible to define an
area of interest in the DTM by giving the WINDOW command and digitising two
points on the map.  If the workstation incorporates a graphics device
that supports hardware pixel replication, it is also possible to centre
the displayed image around a DTM point using puck button 1.  Note that
puck buttons 2 and 3 are defined as ENLARGE and REDUCE.
.P0; If the table has been successfully initialised, then a command menu
may be positioned on the table.  The majority of the SLOPES commands may be
issued from the menu. 
.p0;A menu is positioned on the table using the command ^*SETUP MENU\*. As
with map setup, registration is performed by digitising 4 rectangular
registration points. The registration points represent the 4 corners of the
menu. The points are digitised in the order top left, bottom left, bottom
right and top right using any button on the table puck. A point is digitised in
response to an explanatory prompt on the terminal. 
.P0;A menu command is issued by digitising a point in the relevant menu box.
For commands that require a parameter argument, you should enter the parameter
in response to a prompt on the terminal, using the keyboard.  The ENABLE
commands when given from the menu act as 'flip-flops'; if the enable option
is currently disabled it will be enabled when the menu command is given, and
vice versa.

.p 0;
This command calculates an ASPECT map indicating the direction of SLOPE 
at each node in the DTM.
Aspect is measured in degrees clockwise from north (ie east = 90 degrees, 
west = 270 degrees). 
.p0;Further information on the ASPECT algorithm used is given in the 
Description section.
.p0
The aspect information is either displayed on the graphics screen, if the 
ENABLE GRAPHICS command has been given and/or to a DTI file if the FILEOUT
command has been issued.
.p0
If output to a graphics device is selected then either a grey or colour 
image is produced depending on whether the ENABLE GREY command has been given.
By default a colour image is produced. The displayed step intervals are 
controlled by the ANGLE__INTERVAL command.
.p0; If output is to a DTI file then if the ENABLE CLASSIFY has been given
each classified index, as defined by the ANGLE__INTERVAL command  is output to
the DTI file. For example, if an angular step of 10 degrees is specified then
aspect values of 1 to 10 degrees are output to the DTI file with a value of 1,
11 to 20 degrees with  a value of 2 etc. Otherwise the actual calculated
aspect values are output. 
.p0
ASPECT information is only calculated for matrix nodes lying within the
currently defined WINDOW. 
.P0
Typing <CTRL/C> (Pressing the Ctrl and C keys together) aborts the calculation 
and display of ASPECT.

.BR;^*DESCRIPTION:\*
.P 0
.p 0; The ENABLE TABLE command initialises the table monitor to allow 
input from a digitising table. The command SETUP MAP may be used to register
a map to the DTI file. The SETUP MENU command allows commands to be issued using
the SLOPES table menu.
In the event of failure, input from the digitising table or puck button is not
possible, and the program will accept commands only from the terminal. 
.P 0
Table initialisation will generally fail because no Table Monitor is currently
active, or because the Table Monitor is locked by another user. If neither of
these reasons appear to apply, you should consult the TABLIB Reference Manual,
or seek guidance from your system manager.
.p0
If the logical name LSL$AUTO__ENABLE__TABLE is defined with a value of
"1", then the table is initialised  on program startup. 
.p0
The DISABLE TABLE command may be used to turn off input from the digitising 
table.
.p0;The SHOW ENABLE command may be used to check on the status of table input.

The colour table is a file containing the RGB definitions for a series of
colour values. These values are used when images are displayed on the 
screen. 
If the optional keyword argument is omitted, then the specified
colour table is read in immediately.
.p0
The keyword argument is used to to specify the colour table to be used 
when subsequent SLOPE, ASPECT, SHADE or HEIGHT__DIFFERENCE maps are
generated on the graphics screen.

This command is used to specify the reflectance map to be used in the generation
of a shaded relief map. The three reflectance maps are as follows:-
.lit

		1		= Peucker's piecewise linear approximation 
			  	  to a Lambertian surface.
		2 (default)     = Reflectance from a Lambertian surface.
		3		= Wiechel's projected incident angle
				  algorithm.
.end lit
.p0
Note: Reflectance Map 1 assumes the source of illumination to be in the 
standard 'hill-shading' position ie. in the North West at 45, and current 
sun angle and sun position settings are not used by this algorithm.

.BR;^*DESCRIPTION:\*
.p 0;The SETUP MAP command allows a source document to be registered to the
input DTM.
.P0; In order to register the map and a DTM, the DTM should have first been
specified, and a source document should have been securely attached to the
surface of a digitising table. 
.P0;On giving the command you will be asked to digitise 4 rectangular
registration points. The registration points represent 
4 points on the map that correspond to the 4 corners of the DTM.  The points
are digitised in the order top left (NW), bottom left (SW), bottom right (SE)
and top right (NE) using any button on the table puck. A point should be
digitised in response to a prompt on the terminal.
.BR; An error message is generated if any of the angles of the digitised
rectangle are less than 88 degrees, or greater than 92 degrees (ie. if the
corner points of the rectangle are more than 2 degrees off rectangular). In
this case you will be asked to redigitise the 4 registration points.
.BR; Setup of the map may be aborted using <CTRL/Z> (pressing the Ctrl and Z
keys together).
.p 0;Following the registration of a map to the DTM, coordinate values
required by the WINDOW command, may be input using the table
puck.
