.LM +10

.P 0;The LAMPSCONTROL utility allows a flowline system manager to define a 
flowline system containing one or more flowlines, to create projects to use 
the flowline system, and to launch jobs on selected flowlines.  The 
manager is able to edit any command procedures associated with the operation 
of the system from within LAMPSCONTROL.

.P 0;LAMPSCONTROL examines and updates a relational database containing 
information about the definitions of various flowlines, the progress of 
projects and jobs on those flowlines, and the details of the 
various operators and workstations using the flowline control system.

.P0;The flowline system manager may use LAMPSCONTROL to authorise operators 
and workstations to access specified components of the system.

.P 0;In a different mode of operation, LAMPSCONTROL allows the selection of 
tasks to perform by ordinary operators according to a priority scheme. It 
ensures that tasks are correctly sequenced with reference to the definitions of 
flowlines, elements and wires.

.P 0;Reports may be obtained using LAMPSCONTROL on the system definition, 
the status of projects and jobs in the system, and the historical 
statistics of the system and those who are using it.

.P 0;If required, LAMPSCONTROL will generate a command procedure file (known 
as the 'jacket command procedure') to execute existing command procedures
which will perform any operations, such as file manipulations and calls to 
other utilities, necessary to create projects, to launch jobs and to carry 
out tasks defined by flowline elements.

.HEADER LEVEL 1 ^^^*Description\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Description
.LM +10

.P0;To get the most out of the LAMPSCONTROL documentation, the reader should 
be familiar with the concept of flowline systems as described in 
earlier chapters of this manual. In order to set up a full system including 
the command procedure files to perform the operations required for 
project creation (the 'System' command procedure), job launching (the 
'Flowline' command procedures), elements and procedures, the user must 
be fully versed in the Digital Command Language (DCL) as 
described in the DEC 'VAX/VMS DCL Concepts Manual', 'Guide to Using DCL and 
Command Procedures on VAX/VMS', and 'VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary'. To edit these 
command procedures from within LAMPSCONTROL using the EDT editor, the user 
should also be familiar with its operation as described in the 'VAX/VMS EDT 
Reference Manual'.

.P0;LAMPSCONTROL is a utility to allow the creation, modification and 
utilisation of a flowline system containing one or more flowlines. 
LAMPSCONTROL may operate in several modes, determined by the command 
qualifiers used, and by the operations which the user and his current 
workstation are authorised to perform. It may be used both interactively and 
non-interactively.

.P 0;LAMPSCONTROL maintains a relational database containing information on the 
current status and history of use of the flowline system. Using this it 
ensures the correct sequencing of tasks performed by operators according to the 
defined flowlines.

.TP15
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Interactive Operation
.P 0;If LAMPSCONTROL is used with the /MENU qualifier, then it will operate in 
its interactive mode. When LAMPSCONTROL starts to execute it will first 
display a title page. As the title page is being displayed operator and 
workstation authorisation will be taking place and progress messages indicating
this will appear. Then one of the following will occur, as determined 
by the other qualifiers on the command line:

.LIST

.LE; When /NOTIFY is used, the notification function specified by the 
other qualifiers present will be performed. This is essentially 
non-interactive and will be completed without use of menus or forms.

.LE; When /MANAGE is specified without /CREATE__JOB in the interactive 
mode, LAMPSCONTROL will display the 'Main Management Menu'. The user may then 
select one of the options. If /CREATE__JOB is also used, a job will be 
created as specified without interaction with the user.

.LE; When /REPORT is specified in the interactive mode, the 'Main Report 
Menu', allowing the user to select a report operation, is displayed.

.LE; When /REQUEST is used with LAMPSCONTROL in the interactive mode, one of 
the 'Project Request', 'Job Request' or 'Task Request' menus is displayed. 
The user may then select a task, in a chosen job and project, to perform.

.LE; When LAMPSCONTROL is used without any of /MANAGE, /NOTIFY, /REPORT or 
/REQUEST, the 'Overall Control Menu' will be displayed, allowing the user to 
opt to access one of the main management, reporting or request menus for which 
he is authorised.

.END LIST

.P 0;In interactive mode LAMPSCONTROL is menu and form driven, using the DEC 
Form Management System (FMS). A detailed description of each menu and form 
is given below in the section on 'Command Menus and Data Entry Forms'. 

.TP15
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Non-interactive Operation
.P 0;If LAMPSCONTROL is used with the /NOMENU qualifier option, no title page,
menu pages or forms are displayed, and the program operates in its 
non-interactive mode. In this mode, LAMPSCONTROL will act in one of the 
following ways:

.LIST

.LE; If /NOTIFY is specified, there is little difference between the 
interactive and non-interactive operation of LAMPSCONTROL. In the 
non-interactive mode no title page is displayed. If the /PARAMETERS qualifier 
is used on the command line, LAMPSCONTROL will enter a command driven mode to 
allow the definition of local, global and external parameters. The definition 
of such parameters is described below in the section 'Defining Local, Global 
and External Parameters'.

.LE; If /REQUEST is used with LAMPSCONTROL in the non-interactive mode, 
the highest priority task, if any are available, for which the user on his 
current workstation is authorised, will be selected. A corresponding 
task jacket command procedure will be created, and LAMPSCONTROL will finish 
executing. The user may then call the jacket command procedure to perform the 
task. The non-interactive requesting and performing of tasks may be done by a 
command procedure, executing in a batch job, authorised to carry out only 
non-interactive elements. Appropriate non-interactive tasks could then be 
completed, without the intervention of any operators, whenever such 
tasks became available.

.LE; /MANAGE should generally only be used in the interactive mode of 
operation unless /CREATE__JOB is also specified. If /CREATE__JOB is present 
with /MANAGE then no user interaction is required to create the specified job, 
and the operation of LAMPSCONTROL will proceed as in the interactive mode, but 
without the display of any title page.

.LE; /REPORT should not be used in the non-interactive mode.

.LE; LAMPSCONTROL should not be used without any of the /NOTIFY, /MANAGE 
or /REQUEST qualifiers in the non-interactive mode. 

.END LIST

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Editing Command Procedures
.P 0;LAMPSCONTROL stores the file specifications of any command procedures 
relating to project creation (the 'System' command procedure), job launching 
(the 'Flowline' command procedures), elements, procedures, projects and jobs. 
The manager is able to edit any such command procedures from LAMPSCONTROL 
with the EDT editor, which he may opt to use when creating or editing the 
system component definitions with the appropriate data entry forms, or when 
modifying or examining the statuses of the projects and jobs from the 
appropriate menus.

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures
.P0;When LAMPSCONTROL is used with the /COMMAND__FILE qualifier, a file 
containing a DCL command procedure, known as a 'jacket command procedure', 
will be generated. 

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> File Specification
.P0;It is recommended that every operator use a different jacket command 
procedure specification. This avoids the confusion which can arise if two 
operators create and then attempt to execute jacket command procedures with 
the same specification. If the jacket command procedure name is constructed 
from the operator's process name and the name of the cluster node for his 
current session, then a unique jacket command procedure file specification 
will be ensured cluster wide. This is because the process name must be 
unique on its node, and the node name must be different from all other 
node names on the cluster.

.P 0;More details about the jacket command procedures written by LAMPSCONTROL 
are given in the section 'Jacket Command Procedures and DCL Symbols'.

.P 0;When using LAMPSCONTROL interactively with the /REQUEST qualifier, to 
select the next task to perform, the user will have access to the three 
request menus, the 'Project Request Menu', the 'Job Request Menu' and the 
'Task Request Menu'. The first menu displayed for user interaction, when 
LAMPSCONTROL begins to execute, is determined by the last project, job and task 
on which the user worked.

.P 0;If the user's last project and job are still active, then the user will be 
presented with a task menu for that job, with the last task worked on, if it 
has not been completed, as the first option. If the user's last project is 
active, but the last job worked on is not, then the job menu for that project 
will be displayed. If the last project worked on by the user is no longer 
active then the project menu will presented by LAMPSCONTROL.

.P 0;Regardless of which of the three request menus is entered when 
LAMPSCONTROL begins to execute, the user will be free to move up and down the 
hierarchical project, job and task request menus by selecting the appropriate 
options. Further details of these menus are given in the section 'Command 
Menus and Data Entry Forms'.

.HEADER LEVEL 1 ^^^*Use of LAMPSCONTROL by Ordinary Operators\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Use of LAMPSCONTROL by Ordinary Operators

.BLANK
.LM +10
.P 0;It is not intended that the ordinary 'operators', whose job it is to 
carry out the menial, repetitive operations associated with completing 
individual elements in a flowline should have access to the full functionality 
of LAMPSCONTROL. Allowing this would defeat the whole purpose of LAMPSCONTROL, 
which is to ensure that well defined elements in a flowline are carried out 
in a particular sequence and on the required datasets. If an ordinary operator 
were allowed access to, say, the management menus, then he could, 
through ignorance or mischievousness, interfere with the sequencing of tasks 
or even with the definition of the system.

.P 0;Instead, the operator should only be allowed access to the 
project, job and task request menus. This can be achieved by authorising 
the operator, with a given username, to perform only the 'Request' and 'Notify' 
operations on the database. That is, the operator will be authorised to use 
only the /REQUEST and /NOTIFY 
command qualifiers with LAMPSCONTROL. Furthermore, the operator should always 
access the system through a captive command procedure, ideally part of, or 
called by, his login command procedure. This would call LAMPSCONTROL 
with the /REQUEST qualifier, taking the operator directly to a project, job or 
task request menu. The captive command procedure would then execute any jacket 
command procedure generated by LAMPSCONTROL, and would loop for the next call 
of LAMPSCONTROL with /REQUEST. The operator could exit from the system by 
selecting the 'Exit from LAMPSCONTROL' option on the 'Project Request Menu'.

.BLANK
.LM +10
.P0;Access to LAMPSCONTROL is authorised in terms of both the name of the user 
and the identity of the workstation involved. LAMPSCONTROL expects the logical 
name LSL$FLN__WORKSTATION to be defined to give the identity of the current 
workstation.

.P0;This may be done at any time before LAMPSCONTROL is called. For ordinary 
operators, it is advised that the definition occurs in some form of captive 
login command procedure which subsequently executes LAMPSCONTROL. This 
prevents the definition of LSL$FLN__WORKSTATION being altered by the operator.

.P0;If no translation for LSL$FLN__WORKSTATION is found, LAMPSCONTROL will 
terminate its execution after displaying a suitable message.

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> and DCL Symbols
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> and Jacket Command Procedures 

.BLANK
.LM +10

.P 0;LAMPSCONTROL may generate one of a number of DCL command files, referred 
to as 'jacket command procedures', to perform the actions relating to an 
operation requested from it. These jacket command procedures will access or 
assign a number of DCL symbols. 

.TP15
.P0;When LAMPSCONTROL is used with the /COMMAND__FILE qualifier, a file 
containing a DCL command procedure will be generated. This command procedure 
may carry out the following functions, depending on the command qualifiers and 
menu options selected by the user :

.LIST

.LE;^*Project Creation Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Project Creation
.BR; When the 'Create a project' option is selected from the 'Project and Job 
Creation Menu', a 'Project creation' jacket command procedure to execute 
the 'System' command procedure is created. The system command procedure will 
perform the operations necessary for creating a new project, including 
creating a 'Project' command procedure specific to that project. When the 
'System' command procedure has finished executing, the jacket command procedure 
will call LAMPSCONTROL with the /NOTIFY, /PROJECT__ID, /CREATION__RESULT and 
/NEW__COMMAND__PROCEDURE qualifiers to indicate the successful initiation 
of a project and inform the flowline control system of the specification of 
the project specific command procedure.

.LE;^*Job Launching Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Job Launching
.BR; When the 'Create a job' option is selected from the 'Project and Job 
Creation Menu', or when the /MANAGE and /CREATE__JOB qualifiers are used, a 
'Job launching' jacket command procedure to execute a 'Flowline' command 
procedure, specific to a flowline, is created. The flowline command procedure 
will perform the operations necessary for launching a 
job on the flowline, including creating a 'Job' 
command procedure specific to that job. When the flowline command procedure 
has finished executing, the jacket command procedure will call LAMPSCONTROL 
with the /NOTIFY, /JOB__ID, /CREATION__RESULT and /NEW__COMMAND__PROCEDURE 
qualifiers to indicate the successful initiation of a job.

.LE;^*Task Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Task
.BR; When the user requests a task to perform, either using the non-interactive 
automatic task selection option (/REQUEST with /NOMENU), or by choosing one 
from the 'Task Request Menu', then LAMPSCONTROL will create a 'Task' jacket 
command procedure. The task jacket command procedure will execute 
the relevant project, job and element command procedures and 
will then call LAMPSCONTROL with the /NOTIFY, /SESSION__ID, 
/SESSION__RESULT, /PROBLEM, /OUTCOME and /CPU qualifiers to inform the flowline 
control system of the result of the session.

.LE;^*Wait Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Wait
.BR; If the user makes a non-interactive task selection request, 
using the /REQUEST 
and /NOMENU qualifiers together, and no tasks are currently available, then 
LAMPSCONTROL will set up a 'Wait' jacket command procedure which will 
wait for 
a delta-time defined using the /WAIT__TIME command qualifier (defaulting to 1 
minute). This allows non-interactive task selection 
requests to LAMPSCONTROL to be made from a command procedure in a continuous 
loop, which will execute any jacket command 
procedure created. If no task is 
available, it will execute the 'Wait' command procedure and then retry the 
non-interactive task selection. The use of a 'Wait' jacket command procedure 
avoids fruitless non-interactive task requests being repeated too frequently, 
which would waste computer resources.

.LE;^*Null Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Null
.BR; If the user wishes to request an operation, or series of operations, which 
requires nothing external to LAMPSCONTROL to complete it, or if the user 
specifies the /NOLOGOFF qualifier in the LAMPSCONTROL command line and selects 
the 'Exit from LAMPSCONTROL' option on the current top level menu, then a 
'Null' jacket command procedure is created. This command procedure does 
nothing, except set up the FLN__JACKET__TYPE symbol and delete itself, when 
executed. 

.LE;^*Error Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Error
.BR; If LAMPSCONTROL encounters an error while attempting to provide a service 
to the user then an 'Error' command procedure is generated. When executed 
this will advise the user that there is a problem.

.LE;^*Logoff Jacket Command Procedure\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Jacket Command Procedures> Logoff
.BR; If the 'Exit from LAMPSCONTROL' option is selected from a 
LAMPSCONTROL menu, and the /LOGOFF qualifier was used in the original 
LAMPSCONTROL command line, then a 'Logoff' jacket command procedure 
will be created which, when executed, will terminate the user's current 
terminal session.

.END LIST

.TP25
.P 0;The user should generally specify the /COMMAND__FILE qualifier so that 
LAMPSCONTROL creates a command procedure, even if it is often a null command 
procedure. Then, when LAMPSCONTROL finishes executing, the user should call 
the command procedure which has been created. A good way to do this is to 
write a command procedure to call LAMPSCONTROL with a command line containing 
a /COMMAND__FILE qualifier specifying a particular command filename unique 
to the current user and process, and to follow it with a line to execute the 
command procedure just generated. For example, an extract from a suitable 
command procedure might be:

.LITERAL

	$!
	$! Request non-interactive task selection by LAMPSCONTROL
	$!
	$	LAMPSCONTROL -
			/REQUEST -
			/NOMENU -
			/COMMAND_FILE = JON_JACKET.COM
	$!
	$! Now execute the jacket command procedure written by LAMPSCONTROL
	$!
	$	@JON1_JACKET.COM

.END LITERAL

.P 0;The jacket command procedures written by LAMPSCONTROL will delete 
themselves once they have performed their operations.

.P 0;It is advised that each user has a unique jacket command procedure 
specification to avoid the possibility of one user executing or deleting 
another user's jacket command procedure. For more information on this, refer 
to the 'Description' section above.

.P 0;For those functions of LAMPSCONTROL which involve the execution of a 
non-null jacket command procedure, it can be seen that there are two calls 
made on LAMPSCONTROL. The first call, by the user, causes LAMPSCONTROL to 
create a jacket command procedure to carry out an operation. 
LAMPSCONTROL will ensure that the current user is authorised to carry out the 
requested operation, and will then create a jacket command procedure. The user 
then executes the jacket command procedure. The jacket command procedure 
performs the necessary 
operations, and calls LAMPSCONTROL again, with the /NOTIFY qualifier, 
to indicate the outcome of the operation. Thus, in the case of task command 
procedures, LAMPSCONTROL will store the 
outcome of a particular task in the flowline system database, and, depending 
on that outcome, may schedule any subsequent tasks.

.P0;Any DCL symbols to be examined by jacket command procedures should be 
globally assigned, either before the jacket command procedure is executed, or 
by command procedures called from the jacket command procedure. 
For example, a jacket command procedure to perform a task will expect the 
element and procedure command procedures which it calls to set up the 
FLN__RETURN, FLN__OUTCOME and  FLN__PROBLEM symbols to indicate the 
termination status of the session.

.P0;Any symbols set up by the jacket command procedures will be globally 
assigned, and may be accessed by other command procedures called from them or 
after them, for example system, flowline, project, job, element or procedure 
command procedures. An element command procedure, say,  should obtain 
the file specification for its procedure command procedure from the symbol
FLN__PROCEDURE__COMPROC.

.P0;No DCL symbols starting with the characters 'FLN__' should be used in the 
user defined 
command procedures to be called from the jacket command procedure, apart from 
those described below. This ensures that no name clashes occur with symbols 
used internally by the jacket command procedures.

.P0;The global DCL symbols involved are listed and described below:

.BL2;.TP15;.P0;^*FLN__CREATION__RESULT\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__CREATION__RESULT
.P0;This symbol contains a string keyword, which should be assigned 
in the 'System' (project creation) or 
'Flowline' (job launching) command procedure, and should indicate the success 
or otherwise of the procedure.
.I0;The FLN__CREATION__RESULT symbol is used in constructing a project or job 
creation jacket 
command procedure LAMPSCONTROL notification command line. Its value is 
supplied to the /CREATION__RESULT (q.v.) qualifier. FLN__CREATION__RESULT 
should be assigned a string containing one of the keywords associated with 
/CREATION__RESULT, that is one of the following:

.P5;^*SUCCESS\*
.I5;^*FAILURE\*

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__ELEMENT__COMPROC\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__ELEMENT__COMPROC
.P0;This is assigned by a task jacket command procedure to be a string 
containing the specification of the element command procedure associated 
with the task. The jacket 
command procedure will call the element command procedure using the command 
line:

.P5;$#####@'FLN__ELEMENT__COMPROC'

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__ELEMENT__ID\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__ELEMENT__ID

containing the identifier of the element corresponding to that task.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__FLOWLINE__COMPROC\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__FLOWLINE__COMPROC

it will call to launch the job.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__FLOWLINE__ID\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__FLOWLINE__ID
.P0;This is assigned by a job launching jacket command procedure to be a

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__INT
.P0;If this has a DCL 'TRUE' value (ie if it starts with 'Y','y','T' or 't') 
then the jacket command procedure is being 
executed interactively. 
.I0;This symbol should be set up before the jacket 
command procedure is executed. If the jacket command procedure finds it is not 
defined, its value will be determined with the DCL lexical function call, 
F$GETJPI("","MODE").

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__JACKET__COMPROC\*

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__JOB__COMPROC
.P0;The FLN__JOB__COMPROC symbol is assigned, as a string, the file 
specification of the 
current job's command procedure. 
.I0;When job launching occurs, the flowline 
command procedure should determine the job command procedure specification by 
interaction with the user, and should assign it to this symbol; the jacket 
command procedure may then use it in constructing its LAMPSCONTROL 
notification command line, with the /NEW__COMMAND__PROCEDURE qualifier. 
.I0;A task 
jacket command procedure assigns the command procedure specification for the 
job containing the current task to this symbol.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__JOB__ID\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__JOB__ID
.P0;This contains a string value representing the integer identifier of the 
current job. It is assigned by the task jacket command procedure.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__JOB__NAME\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__JOB__NAME
.P0;This is assigned a string value representing the character job name of the

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameters> Definition with DCL Symbols
.P0;These symbols can be assigned string values by any command procedures 
executed during the performance of a session within a task, for example, they 
may be set up by element or procedure command procedures.
.BR;The values assigned to these symbols will be lists of local, global or 
external parameters for passing between tasks or sessions (see Chapter 2).
.BR;These symbols will be used by the task jacket command procedure to 
construct the parameter definition commands (see the section 'Defining 
Local, Global and External Parameters' below) as follows:

.LM +15
.P-10;PARAMETER>#^*LOCAL <FLN__LOCAL__PARAM>\*
.I-10;PARAMETER>#^*GLOBAL <FLN__GLOBAL__PARAM>\*
.I-10;PARAMETER>#^*EXTERNAL <FLN__EXTERNAL__PARAM>\*
.LM -15

.P0;As an illustration of how to set up these symbols, consider the 
requirement to set up the following local parameters (which will all be valid 
DCL statements) for inclusion in the next task jacket command procedure:

.P5;L1 = 1
.I5;L2 = "local2"
.I5;@plot

.P0;To specify these local parameters, the procedure or element command 
procedure should globally assign the symbol FLN__LOCAL__PARAM as follows:

.LM +15
.P-10;FLN__LOCAL__PARAM == """L1 = 1"",""L2 = """"local2"""""",""@plot"""
.LM -15

.P0;This would result in the command, after substitution of the symbol 
FLN__LOCAL__PARAM:

.LM +15
.P-10;PARAMETER>#^*LOCAL "L1 = 1","L2 = ""local2""","@plot"\*
.LM -15

.P0;The use of pairs of double quotes, within strings delimited by double 
quotes, to signify single double quotes, should be noted.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__MODE\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__MODE
.P0;This should assigned a keyword string value before LAMPSCONTROL is 
executed to create a jacket command procedure. Its value indicates the mode of 
operation of LAMPSCONTROL:

.LM +15
.P-10;^*BATCH\*####non-interactive operation (task request, job launching)
.I-10;^*CONTROL\*##entry through 'Overall Control Menu'
.I-10;^*MANAGE\*###entry through 'Main Management Menu'
.I-10;^*OPERATE\*##entry through 'Request Menus'
.I-10;^*REPORT\*###entry through 'Main Report Menu'
.I-10;^*SLAVE\*####operating interactively, but not from terminal session
.LM -15

.P0;The final 'SLAVE' mode of operation occurs if LAMPSCONTROL executes in a 
subprocess or from a batch job, but with input and output through a VT220 
compatible device.
.I0;If FLN__MODE is not set up before a jacket command procedure is executed, 
then that jacket command procedure will assign it a default value, either 
'OPERATE' or 'BATCH' depending on whether the value of FLN__INT is TRUE or 
FALSE respectively.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__OPERATOR\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__OPERATOR

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__OUTER__PROJECT__ID
.P0;These symbols are assigned string values by the job launching jacket 
command procedure. 

.BR;For jobs which are to be launched on subflowlines, these 
symbols contain the element, flowline, procedure, and project identifiers 
and command procedure specifications, and the job name and command procedure 
specification for the element, flowline, procedure, project and job enclosing 
the subflowline on which the job is to be launched.

.BR;For jobs which are to be launched on ordinary 
flowlines, these symbols will be assigned null string values. 

.BR;It is thus possible to write a flowline command procedure which, by 
checking if these symbols have null values, can carry out different operations 
for launching jobs on its flowline as a full flowline or as a subflowline.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__OUTCOME\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__OUTCOME
.P0;This symbol should be assigned a string representation of the integer 
outcome value of a completed task. The assignment should be carried out by the 
element or procedure command procedures. The FLN__OUTCOME symbol will be used 
by the task jacket command procedure in constructing the LAMPSCONTROL command 
line to notify a session termination.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__PROBLEM\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__PROBLEM
.P0;This symbol should be assigned a string containing a brief description of 
the nature of the problem when a session terminates in 'ERROR' or 'RESTART' 
conditions. The assignment should be carried out by the element or procedure 
command procedure. The symbol will be used by the task jacket command 
procedure in constructing the LAMPSCONTROL command line to notify a session 
termination.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__PROJECT__COMPROC\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__PROJECT__COMPROC
.P0;The FLN__PROJECT__COMPROC symbol will hold, as a string, the file 
specification of the 
current project's command procedure. When project creation occurs, the system
command procedure should determine the project command procedure specification 
by interaction with the user, and should assign it to this symbol; the jacket 
command procedure may then use it in constructing its LAMPSCONTROL 
notification command line.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__PROCEDURE__COMPROC\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__PROCEDURE__COMPROC
.P0;This symbol is assigned the file specification of the procedure command 
procedure required for the current task by a task jacket command procedure. 
The element command procedure should call the procedure command procedure 
named by this symbol.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__PROJECT__ID\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__PROJECT__ID
.P0;This symbol holds the string identifier of the current project.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__RESULT\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__RESULT
.P0;This symbol is used in constructing a task jacket command procedure's 
LAMPSCONTROL notification command line. Its value is supplied to the
/SESSION__RESULT (q.v.) qualifier. FLN__RESULT should be assigned a 
string containing one of the keywords associated with /SESSION__RESULT, that  
is one of the following :

.LM +15
.P-10;^*COMPLETE\*
.I-10;^*CONTINUE\*
.I-10;^*RESTART\*
.I-10;^*ERROR\*
.I-10;^*OFFLINE\*
.I-10;^*SUBFLOWLINE\*
.LM -15

.P0;This assignment should occur in the element or procedure command 
procedure, and should indicate the termination status of the session.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__SESSION__ID\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__SESSION__ID

It contains the integer session identifier unique to the current session.

.BL2;.TP10;.P0;^*FLN__SESSION__STATUS\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> DCL Symbols> FLN__SESSION__STATUS
.P0;This symbol is assigned a string by value by the task jacket command 
procedure indicating whether the session is a new session, or the online 
resumption of a session which has just completed an offline phase. Its 
possible values are:

.LM +15
.P-10;^*NEW\*#######This is a new session.

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameters> Definition with Commands

.LM +10

.P0;If the /PARAMETERS qualifier is used in the command line for session 
termination notification, then LAMPSCONTROL will, when it begins to execute, 
enter a command driven mode to allow the definition of up to 16 of each 
(48 in total) of the 3 types of session/task parameters (local, global and 
external).

.P0;For more information on the nature and usage of local, global and 
external parameters, refer to Chapter 2.

.P0;The commands available in this mode are:

.BL2;.TP4;.P0;^*EXIT\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameter Definition Commands> EXIT
.P0; If this command is used, the command driven mode will be terminated, and 
LAMPSCONTROL will continue with its execution to carry out the notification of 
the end of the session.

.BL2;.TP4;.P0;^*EXTERNAL string-list\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameter Definition Commands> EXTERNAL
.P0; This command is used to specify a list of external parameters.

.BL2;.TP4;.P0;^*GLOBAL string-list\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameter Definition Commands> GLOBAL
.P0; This command is used to specify a list of global parameters.

.BL2;.TP4;.P0;^*LOCAL string-list\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameter Definition Commands> LOCAL
.P0; This command is used to specify a list of local parameters.

.BL2;.TP5;.P0;The 'string-list' argument for the above commands consists of a 
list of strings separated by spaces or commas. If any string contains a space 
or a comma, it must be delimited by double quotes ("). If a double quote is 
required in any string delimited by double quotes, that double quote should be 
represented a pair of double quotes. Each item in the 'string-list' will 
become a parameter, and should thus constitute a valid DCL statement.

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Parameter Definition Commands> DCL Symbol Substitution
.P0;It is possible to achieve the substitution of the value of a DCL symbol 
for part or all of the 'string-list' argument. If the DCL symbol name should 
be included in the required position in the argument, delimited by '<' at the 
start, and '>' at the end, of the name.

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Menus> Standard Options
.P0;Each menu will consist of one or more options. These may be divided into 
two categories, options which are specific to a particular menu, and 
the 'standard' options common to most of the menus used by LAMPSCONTROL. These 
generally applicable standard options are:

.LIST

.LE; ^*Move up to 'higher level' menu\*
.BR;This option would be found on menus which were displayed as a result of 
selecting an option on another menu. It can be used to move up through a 
hierarchy of menus. The phrase 'higher level' will usually be replaced on the 
menu option with the name, or a description of, the menu which would be 
displayed by selecting it. 
.BR;This option will not be found on the top level menu for the current 
activation of LAMPSCONTROL (see description of 'Jump to top level menu' 
option).

.LE; ^*Jump to top level menu\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Menus> Top Level Menus
.BR;This option is present on most menus. Selecting it causes the menu at the 
top of the hierarchy of menus, through which the current menu was reached, to 
be displayed. 
.BR;Exactly which menu this is depends on the combination of command 
qualifiers used with LAMPSCONTROL.
.BR;If /MANAGE was used, the 'Main Management Menu' is the top level menu.
.BR;If /REPORT was used, the 'Main Report Menu' is the top level menu.
.BR;If /REQUEST was used, the 'Project Request Menu' is the top level menu.
.BR;If none of /REQUEST, /REPORT or /MANAGE was used, the 'Overall Control 
Menu' is the top level menu.
.BR;This option is omitted from a menu if the effect of selecting it would 
be the same as that of selecting the 'Move up to higher level menu' option, or, 
obviously, if the menu is the top level menu.

.LE; ^*Exit from LAMPSCONTROL\*
.BR;This option is present on the LAMPSCONTROL top level menu (see the 
previous item). Selecting it causes LAMPSCONTROL to 
create a suitable command procedure ('logoff' if /LOGOFF was used or 'null' if 
/NOLOGOFF was used), and then to finish executing.

.LE; ^*Move to next page of options\*
.BR;On particularly long menus, when all the options cannot be displayed in a 
single screenful, this option will be displayed. By selecting it the user can 
move forwards through the list of menu options, to examine a fresh page of 
alternatives. If the current menu page represents the end of the option list, 
this option will not be displayed.

.LE; ^*Move to previous page of options\*
.BR;On particularly long menus, when all the options cannot be displayed in a 
single screenful, this option will be displayed. By selecting it the user can 
move backwards through the list of menu options, to examine a fresh page of 
alternatives. If the current menu page represents the start of the option list, 
this option will not be displayed.

.END LIST

.P0;The standard options above will not be described in the individual 
sections below relating to particular menus.

.P0;Any user able to access a particular menu will be authorised to select or 
perform all the options displayed on it.

.BL2
.P0;In each example of the forms below, the presence of underline characters, 
'__', indicates an area into which the user is expected to type a 
field value. This is also true of the forms displayed on the screen. On the 
screen, the field into which any character typed will be placed is indicated 
by the position of the cursor and will appear in reverse video. 

.TP10
.P 0;The following keys may be used to control movement
between, and entry of data into, forms and fields: 
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Forms> Control Key Sequences
.LM +15

.TP6
.P -12;^*Tabulate\*####Advances the cursor to the next field in the form. 
Attempting to advance forward from the last field on a form will result in the 
message ^*'No next field on form'\* being displayed.

.TP6
.P -12;^*Back#Space\*##Moves the cursor back to the previous field on the form. 
If an attempt is made to move back from the first field on a form, the message 
^*'No previous field on form'\* is displayed.

.TP6
.P -12;^*Line#Feed\*###Deletes the contents of the current field.

.TP6
.P -12;^*Return\*######Exits from a form. Any data entered will be acted on

.P -12;^*GOLD(PF1)#7\*#On the data entry forms, this command
discards any data entered already, and returns the user to the menu from which 
the form was selected. No check is made on whether data for mandatory fields 
have been entered. 

.TP6
.P -12;^*PF2\*#########This is the help key. For most fields on the data entry 
forms, pressing the key once will cause details of the format and type of data 
required for that field to be displayed on the bottom line of the screen.
.BR;For most forms, pressing the help key twice, over any field,
will cause a help form to be displayed on the screen. Frequently, there is 
more help text than can be fitted onto a single form, so it is broken up into 
a number of forms which may be viewed consecutively. The user may move 
from one help form to the next by pressing the help key. The user may 
return to the original form, from any of the help forms, by pressing the 
ENTER key.

.TP6
.P -12;^*PF3\*#########Switch on the overstrike mode for entering characters 
in fields. In overstrike mode, any character typed will replace the 
character over which the cursor is positioned.

.BL2
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Forms> Control Key Sequences (Scrolled Areas)
.P0;Some forms contain 'scrolled areas'. These areas consist of a number of
identical and consecutive lines on the form, containing one or more fields, 
which can be scrolled to allow the user to enter a 'table' of data of 
virtually unlimited length. Movement between fields on the same line
of the scrolled area is controlled in the same way as movement between fields 
on ordinary areas of the form (with 'tabulate' and 'back space'). The user
will enter the scrolled area by moving forwards as normal from the field
immediately preceding the area. Movement out of the scrolled areas, and 
between lines of the scrolled area is controlled using the following 
key sequences:

.LM +20

.P -17;^*GOLD#Up#arrow\*####Moves the cursor to the field preceding the
scrolled area.

.P -17;^*GOLD#Down#arrow\*##Moves the cursor to the field following the 
scrolled area.

.P -17;^*Up#arrow\*#########Moves the cursor to the line of the scrolled 
area preceding the current one.

.P -17;^*Down#arrow\*#######Moves the cursor to the line of the scrolled 
area following the current one.

.LM -20



.P0;Movement within a field, for editing purposes, is controlled by the back 
arrow (to move to the right) and forward arrow (to move to the left) keys.

.P0;On some forms, default values will initially appear in some of the 
fields. These may be edited as required by the user.

.P0;On certain menus and forms, certain 'GOLD sequences' - that is pressing 
the GOLD (PF1) key followed by some other key - have special uses. Details of 
these are given in individual menu and form descriptions.

.I0;Typing 'GOLD D' will cause the user to be prompted to make sure that this 
operation is really required. If the response is 'Y' for 'Yes', the job will be 
deleted. That is, all references to the job, including the tasks which it 
contains, will be removed from the area of the database dealing with current 
jobs. Information about the history of the job will be retained. This option 
can only be applied to jobs containing no active tasks. Note that if the job
is being deleted because it is intended to re-launch it, then it is advisable
to rename it using 'GOLD N' first, otherwise a different name will be needed
for the new job.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#E##-#edit job command procedure file\*
.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Editing Command Procedures
.I0;Typing 'GOLD E' will cause the EDT editor to be started, with the job 
command procedure as the file for editing. If the file does not exist, 
then EDT may be used to create it.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#H##-#change the status of the job to 'Held'\*
.I0;Typing 'GOLD H' will change the status of the current job to 'Held'. 
This will allow any current sessions for any tasks in this job 
to be completed, but will prevent any further sessions or tasks being started 
in the job. The user may proceed to modify the statuses of tasks in the job.
.BR;This key sequence has no effect if the job status is already 'Held'.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#M##-#move a job backwards in its flowline\*
.I0;Typing 'GOLD M' will cause the 'Element Selection for Job Movement Menu' 
to be displayed. The user may use this to move the current position of a job 
in the flowline back to one or more of the elements through which it has 
passed. This will allow a job to be restarted at a particular stage in the 
flowline, for example, after an error has occurred.
.I0;This option automatically causes a job to be 'Held'. It will require 
releasing, after moving, before any tasks can be performed as part of it.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#P##-#alter the priority of a job\*
.I0;Typing 'GOLD P' will cause the user to be prompted for a new priority for 
the job.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#N##-#alter the name of a job\*
.I0;Typing 'GOLD N' will cause the user to be prompted for a new name for
the job. This is only recommended if the job is about to be deleted so
that another with the same name can be launched. If the name is not changed,
then the presence of a job history record for the old job will prevent the
new one from being launched. For a job which has already been completed or
deleted, the Job Statistics Menu allows the name to be changed.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#R##-#change the status of the job to 'Active'\*
.I0;Typing 'GOLD R' will release the current job, changing its status to 
'Active'. Any tasks in the job will be able to proceed, with

.P0;The following key sequences are associated with this menu:

.I0;When 'GOLD H' is typed and the cursor is currently positioned on the same 
line of the menu as a task with 'Inactive' status in the menu, the status of 
that task will be changed to 'Held'. 
.BR;If the status of the task is already 'Held' this key sequence has no 
effect. 
.BR;If the status of the task is 'Active', a message will be displayed and 
the status will not be changed.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#R##-#change the status of the current task to 'Inactive'\*
.I0;If 'GOLD R' is typed when the cursor is positioned on a task with 'Held' 
status, the user will be prompted to determine if the task should be restarted 
as if none of it had been done before, or whether it should be continued from 
the stage which it had reached before being transferred to 'Held' status. The 
prompt used is described below. The task's status will then be changed to 
'Inactive', and it will be restarted or continued as appropriate. 
.BR;If typed when the current task is not 'Held', then 'GOLD R' has no effect.

.TP10;.P0;^*GOLD#S##-#skip the current task\*
.I0;If 'GOLD S' is typed when the cursor is positioned on the same line as a 
task with 'Inactive' status, then the task will be skipped, being marked in 
the database as if it had completed successfully. The user will be prompted 
for the outcome value of the task, so that an appropriate subsequent task 
can be initiated. The user will also be 
prompted to determine if parameters are to be entered. If required, th local, 
global and external parameters forms will be displayed to allow the user to 
enter the parameters associated with the completion of the task.
The prompts used are described below.

.P0;The following prompts for additional user input, which appear at 
the bottom of the screen, are associated with this menu:

.TP10;.P0;^*Treat task as if no sessions have been performed on it (Y/N) ?\*
.I0;This appears when the user opts to release a task with the 'GOLD R' key 
sequence. It allows the user to specify whether the task should be continued 
from the point which it had reached when it was 'Held', or whether it should 
be completely restarted. Answering 'Y' for 'Yes' causes the task to be 
restarted, while answering 'N' for 'No' causes it to be continued. The default 
response is 'N'.

.TP10;.P0;^*Task outcome (RETURN to abort) :\*
.I0;This appears when the user opts to skip a task. The value entered should be 
one of the possible integers which would have been returned by the relevant 
element command procedure (in FLN__OUTCOME) had the task been executed and 
completed successfully. The outcome value determines which of the possible 
following tasks will be initiated. If RETURN is pressed without entering
a number, then the task is not skipped.

.TP10;.P0;^*Enter parameters (Y/N) ?\*
.I0;This prompt appears after the task outcome prompt above, during a task 
skipping operation. It allows the user to choose whether to enter any local, 
global or external parameters associated with the task. If the user replies 
'Y' for 'Yes', the 'Local Parameters', 'Global Parameters' and 'External 
Parameters' forms will be displayed in that order. The user may then enter any 
parameters required. If the user replies 'N' for 'No' in response to the 
prompt, the task skipping will be performed with no parameters.

.TP10;.P0;^*Unable to change 'Active' task to 'Held'\*
.I0;The user has attempted, by typing 'GOLD H' to change the status of an 
'Active' task to 'Held'. This is not possible, since, if a task is active, 
a session associated with it will be in progress. If the user wants to alter
the task to 'Held', the termination of this session, but not of the task, 
with result 'CONTINUE', should first be indicated to LAMPSCONTROL using 
the 'Session Notification Menu'. The task status will then become 'Inactive', 
and the user may return to this menu to change the task status to 'Held'.

.INDEX LAMPSCONTROL> Messages> on Menus and Forms
.J
.P0;These messages appear on the last two lines of the terminal screen 
when a menu or form is currently displayed. They are all accompanied by 
an audible warning. Since they are associated with the menu mode of operation 
of LAMPSCONTROL, they will not occur when /NOMENU is used on the command line.

.P0;They are designed to: 

.LM +5
.P -2;-#Tell the user what to do next.
.P -2;-#Inform the user of any invalid or potentially invalid field entries.
.P -2;-#Inform the user of what the LAMPSCONTROL utility is doing.
.P -2;-#Describe any errors which the LAMPSCONTROL utility has encountered.

The messages associated with each form have been described earlier.
 
.P0;Other messages are generated by FMS, the most significant being :
.LM +5
.P 0;^*Numeric required\*
.I 0;^*Alphabetic required\*
.I0;In most of the forms, there are fields, or sub-fields, which can only 
contain numeric characters or can only contain alphabetic characters. In such 
cases, an attempt to enter a character of the wrong type will result in an 
error message being displayed.
.P 0;^*Field full\*
.I0;An attempt was made to enter more than the allowed number of characters in 
the current field.
.P 0;^*Input required\*
.I0;An attempt was made to exit from a form using RETURN  before data for a 
mandatory field was entered.
.P 0;^*Full field required\*
.I0;An attempt was made to move onto another field before the required number 
of characters had been entered in the current field.

.P0;In addition to the above messages which are generated by FMS
and LAMPSCONTROL itself,  other messages  may  be   produced by  the
command line interpreter (CLI), by the relational database 
system (RDB),  and by  Laser-Scan libraries. 
LSLLIB  messages  are  introduced  by    '%LSLLIB' and are
generally self-explanatory.  They are  used  to  explain the
details of program generated errors.
