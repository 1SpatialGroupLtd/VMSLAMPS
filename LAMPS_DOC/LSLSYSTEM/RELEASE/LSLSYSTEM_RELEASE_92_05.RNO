.TITLE LSLSYSTEM Release notes
.PAGE
.HL 1 ^&CONTENT\&
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan software package
LSLSYSTEM. This package provides run time library support and system utilities
to create an environment which is assumed by all other Laser-Scan software.
.P 0
The programs and libraries of the LSLSYSTEM package are documented as part
of the various application packages which use them. In particular, the user
is referred to the MAPPING package documentation for general environment
information. The main component of LSLSYSTEM is the LSL run time library
LSLLIB.OLB, which is also provided as a shareable image file LSLSHR.EXE.
.P 0
This document is part of the LAMPS V4.0 release, which went into Alpha test in
May 1992. It covers changes to package LSLSYSTEM since the previous LAMPS
release (V3.5) which went into Alpha test in September 1991. See the release
notes for the previous LAMPS release for information about earlier changes. 

.HL 1 ^&NEW OR CHANGED FACILITIES\&
The specified versions of the LSLSYSTEM package libraries and programs had the
following facilities added, implemented or their actions altered. 
.LIST 
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LU,")"

.LE;RELEASE NOTES: - These have been trimmed back to the last regular issue.

.LE;MTDUMP.EXE - Version of 27-Nov-1991
.LIST
.LE
This is a utility for producing human-readable dumps of magtapes.
A new qualifier, /SWAP, has been added which enables tapes from foreign
systems (such as Hewlett Packard) to be interpreted correctly. The qualifier is
described as follows:
.BLANK
/SWAP
.BLANK
-#specifies that adjacent bytes in the input are to be swapped.
This is performed irrespective of the data type qualifier. (ie. the bytes in
each word are swapped even if /WORD is not given). This qualifier is intended
for the diagnostics of foreign tapes such as those from Hewlett Packard
systems.
.END LIST 0

.LE;QUO.EXE - Version of 10-Feb-1992
.LIST
.LE
QUO is a utility for showing information about active processes on a system or
cluster. The working set, or physical memory, information printed out by QUO is
now the sum of GETJPI quantities PPGCNT and GPGCNT (private and global page
counts), rather than WSSIZE which was the length of the working set list and
often an overestimate of the physical pages in use. The number now agrees with
that printed by SHOW SYSTEM. 
.LE
The parsing of the QUO command line is now more versatile, in particular the
qualifiers can be put before the nodename if required, and spaces between the
nodename and qualifiers are allowed. A side effect is that some incorrect
command lines which would previously have produced some output will now result
in the error "_%LIB-F-SYNTAXERR, string syntax error detected by LIB$TPARSE".
.END LIST 0

.LE;LSLINSTALL.COM - Version 2.2 of 23-Mar-1992
.LIST
.LE
This procedure is only used at initial installation at a customer site, by the
LSL installation engineer. The procedure now ensures that the customer name
logical name LSL$CUSTOMER__NAME is properly defined immediately after having
been given (SPR1577). 
.END LIST 0

.LE;LSLUPDATE.COM - Version 2.0 of 31-Mar-1992
.LIST
.LE
The LSLUPDATE command procedure is used to install upgrades to LSL software
packages. The new version now has a new CHECK phase in which newly provided
files on LSL$UPDATE__ROOT are checked to see if site-specific versions exist on
LSL$SITE__ROOT. If so, then warning messages are produced to guide the
installer to clear up and avoid the new files being hidden by stale
site-modified versions (SPR1572). 
.LE
LSLUPDATE now checks at the end of the LOAD phase to see if a new version
of LSLUPDATE.COM has been provided as part of the update. If so, it transfers
control to it, to take advantages of any new facilities.
.LE
LSLUPDATE now checks at the start of the MERGE phase to see if any
package-specific LSLUPDATE command files have been provided as part of this
update. If so, it invokes them before continuing with the MERGE phase.
This mechanism allows particular packages (eg XGIS) to clear up before merging 
in the new files.
.END LIST 0

.LE;LSLSHR.EXE, LSLLIB.OLB - Versions of 31-Mar-1992
.LIST
.LE
The argument type of the COUNT arguments to the 3 sort routines (HEAP__SORT,
QUICK__SORT, and SHELL__SORT) has been changed from word (INTEGER_*2) to
long (INTEGER_*4) to enable sorting of larger arrays. The CF, COPY, and SWAP
routines supplied by the caller to these routines should also accept long
index arguments. The arguments passed to these were actually always long but
were documented as word. This change will only affect any users who have
written their own programs using the LSLLIB sort routines, which is unlikely.
Although the change is incompatible, the shareable image version of LSLSHR
remains at 1.5. Laser-Scan programs have been amended to take account of
this change.
.END LIST 0

.LE;LSLSHR.EXE, LSLLIB.OLB - Versions of 13-Apr-1992
.LIST
.LE
The routines CVT__DAY__STR and CVT__DAY__DMY have been amended to return
error code SS$__IVTIME if a day number with absolute value greater than
2973483 (31-DEC-9999) is passed. Previously such values would cause an
integer overflow error. Note that CVT__DAY__STR is used in the _%DD format
conversion, used (for example) when formatting date type AC entries from
IFF files - this will not output anything if the date is invalid.
The shareable image version of LSLSHR remains at 1.5.
