.HL1 ^*FUNCTION\*
.P 0;READCCT is a program to read a Computer Compatible Tape (CCT) containing
remotely sensed data. The program is able to read either a SPOT STANDARD CCT;
a THEMATIC MAPPER CCT, or NRSC RAE CCT. The image data is read into a 
Laser-Scan 
DTI format file, while any header or ancillary data may be written to a 
text file using a 'keyword = value' structure, or output to a terminal or
line printer.
.B
The program allows the user to select which tape records are decoded, as well
as which part, and if appropriate, which bands of the imagery are stored in 
the final DTI file(s).
.PAGE
^*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL1 ^*INTRODUCTION TO SPOT DATA\*
The first SPOT satellite was launched by the French in 1986.  The satellite
orbits in a circular sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of
832 Km. The revisit frequency is 26 days, though the off-nadir viewing
capability of the satellite enables more frequent coverage of a given area to
be achieved if required.
.B
The satellite carries a HRV instrument which is designed to operate in either
panchromatic mode over a broad spectral band producing imagery at 10 metres
resolution, or in multispectral mode within 3 narrower spectral bands,
producing imagery with a ground resolution of 20 metres. 
.B
The imagery contained on the CCT received from CNES will have undergone a
certain level of preprocessing.
.LIST
.LE; Level 1A  
.BR; Radiometric equalisation, but no geometric correction.
.LE; Level 1B  
.BR; Radiometric equalisation and radiometric correction to take
account of satellite motion, plus bulk geometric preprocessing (geometric
correction for the earth's rotation, curvature and viewing angle) involving
data resampling. 
.LE; Level 2
.BR; Radiometric preprocessing as for Level 1B, plus 2 dimensional
geometric resampling using Ground Control Points (GCPs).  This does not include
any compensation for terrain relief.
.LE; Level S
.BR; Radiometric preprocessing as for Level 1B, plus 2 dimensional
geometric resampling to obtain registration with another SPOT scene, itself
processed to Level 1B or Level 2.
.END LIST
Preprocessing parameters of relevance to the applications scientist are 
contained in the SPOT STANDARD CCT Ancillary data records.
.PAGE
^*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL1 ^*INTRODUCTION TO THEMATIC MAPPER CCT\*
A TM scene is generally supplied as 4 quadrants: quadrant 1 contains the upper
left quarter of the scene; quadrant 2 contains the upper right quarter;
quadrant 3 contains the lower left quarter, and quadrant 4 the lower right
quarter. The division of a scene is determined by the WRS scene centre.
The quadrants may be recorded in either Band Interleaved (BIL) or Band
Sequential (BSQ) format.  A 6250 bpi tape, or 3 1600 bpi tapes,
are required to record one scene quadrant.  A full TM scene contains 5965
lines and 6967 samples.
.B
READCCT is able to decode the following TM CCT files:
.LIST
.LE; Volume Directory (Volume Descriptor, File Pointer and Text Records)
.LE; Leader File (File Descriptor, Scene Header, Map Projection and
Radiometric Calibration)
.LE; Imagery File (File Descriptor, Imagery)
.LE; Trailer File (File Descriptor, Trailer)
.END LIST

.PAGE
^*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL1 ^*NRSC RAE CCT DATA\*
The RAE CCT tape format is the means by which the National Remote Sensing
Centre (NRSC) at RAE Farnborough supplies data from their archive of imagery.
The tape format is the same irrespective of the data source.  For certain types
of imagery a number of tapes may be required to hold all the bands of
information relating to a particular scene.  The CCTs are generally written as
9-track 1600 bpi phase encoded tapes. 
.B
Only a limited amount of header information relating to the imagery is
supplied on the CCT. This is contained in a series of records
identified by the ANSI standard tape labels VOL 1, HDR 1, EOF 1,
and EOV 1, and in a series of image header records preceeding the image data
records.  The header information is written in 8 bit ASCII code, and is
used to determine the number, packing and size of the image records.
.B
Exact information about the location and characteristics of the scene, 
satellite ephemeris and altitude, radiometric and geometric preprocessing etc.
is not available from the RAE CCT tape.
.B
The imagery on the CCT is organised in Band Sequential (BSQ) form ie.
the imagery for a single spectral band is grouped together as a set of
image records, and separated from the image records relating to another
spectral band by an image header record.

.HL1 ^*COMMAND QUALIFIERS\*
.LM+10
.BLANK
.P -10;/ANCILLARY
.I -10;/NOANCILLARY
.TP 25
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of all the Ancillary data records contained on
a SPOT STANDARD or TM CCT.  The qualifier is not relevant when reading a
RAE CCT.
.B
On a SPOT CCT, the Ancillary records consist of 5 different classes of data,
namely Ephemeris / Attitude, Radiometric Calibration, Histogram, Map Projection
and Ground Control Point information; on a TM CCT only Map projection and
Radiometric Calibration records are generally present. Decoding of a specific
class of data may be suppressed by use of the appropriate qualifier eg_. the
use of the /NOCALIBRATION qualifier with the /ANCILLARY qualifier, will cause
all Ancillary data records except a Radiometric Calibration record to be
decoded. 
.B
It should be noted that certain Ancillary records may only contain useful
information if the image data has undergone the relevant level of preprocessing
eg_. for SPOT Level 1A processing (radiometric equalisation, but no geometric
correction), the Map Projection and Ground Control Point records will not be
set. 
.B
The decoded information may be output to the terminal or to a data file using
the /LIST qualifier; to the line printer using the /PRINT qualifier, or to a
HDR text file in a 'keyword=value' format if the /HDR qualifier is supplied on
the command line.

.TP 15
.P -10;/ANNOTATION
.I -10;/NOANNOTATION
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of an Annotation data record contained on
a SPOT STANDARD or TM CCT.  The qualifier is not relevant when reading a
RAE CCT.
.B
The Annotation record consists of tick marks, and character strings with
associated coordinate values, which may be used to annotate a photographic
representation of the image. 
.B
On most CCTs this record is unlikely to be present, and therefore in the
current implementation of READCCT this information may only be output to the
terminal or line printer by using the /ANNOTATION qualifier in combination
with either the /LIST or /PRINT qualifiers. 


.TP 20
.P -10;/BAND=integer[,...]
.P -2;-#Selects which bands of image data are transferred from
the CCT to the output DTI file. 
.B
The use of the /BAND qualifier is only required, if the CCT contains
multispectral data. The list of values should be in the range 1 to 7, although
of course the number of bands present on the CCT is dependent on the source of
the multispectral imagery: SPOT MSS contains 3 bands (1-3); LANDSAT MSS
contains 4 bands (numbered 4-7, except for Landsat 4 when the bands are
numbered 1-4), and THEMATIC MAPPER 7 bands (1-7). 
.B
By default Band 1 is selected. If the CCT contains LANDSAT 3 MSS imagery
therefore, the /BAND qualifier should be used to select one or more of the
bands which are numbered 4,5,6,7 on the CCT.
.B
For SPOT panchromatic data this qualifier need not be supplied on the command
line. 

.TP 20
.P -10;/CALIBRATION
.I -10;/NOCALIBRATION
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of an Ancillary record containing Radiometric
Calibration data on a SPOT STANDARD or TM CCT.  The qualifier is not relevant 
when reading a RAE CCT. 
.B
The qualifier may be used alone on the command line to request decoding of
just the calibration data, or may be used with the /ANCILLARY or /HISTOGRAM
/EPHEMERIS /PROJECTION /GCP qualifiers to control which classes of Ancillary
data record are decoded.
.B
The decoded information may be output to the terminal or to a data file using
the /LIST qualifier; to the line printer using the /PRINT qualifier, or to a
HDR text file in a 'keyword=value' format if the /HDR qualifier is supplied on
the command line. In the case of a SPOT CCT ,it should be noted that a
considerable amount of information (12000 values for a full SPOT scene) will be
generated. 

.TP 15
.P -10;/DESCRIPTOR
.I -10;/NODESCRIPTOR
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of a SPOT STANDARD or TM CCT File Descriptor record.
The qualifier is not relevant when reading a RAE CCT.
.B
The File Descriptor contains information on how various data on the tape
should be read, and where certain data values are to be found within
specific records.
.B
The use of the /DESCRIPTOR qualifier is not recommended, and is available
for debugging purposes only.  The qualifier should be used with either the
/LIST or /PRINT qualifiers to output the decoded information to the terminal
or line printer.

.TP 25
.P -10;/DEVICE=device-name
.P -2;-#Identifies the tape device on which the CCT is loaded.
.B
By default the CCT is assumed to be loaded on 'MT0:'
.B
It is essential that the tape is mounted as a foreign volume prior to
running READCCT.  This is achieved using the DCL command MOUNT with the
/FOREIGN qualifier eg_. MOUNT MT0:/FOR  
.B
If the CCT is part of a multi-volume set of CCTs, the program will ask
for a continuation tape to be loaded after the current tape has been
read.  In response to the message:
.LIT

	Mount continuation tape on <device>
	Respond with E to exit, or Y when ready:

.END LIT
a continuation tape should be loaded on the specified device and Y entered
on the terminal.  Note that it is not necessary to MOUNT a continuation
tape.

.TP 10
.P -10;/DIAGNOSTICS
.I -10;/NODIAGNOSTICS
.P -2;-#Writes brief details about the tape record currently being read to the
terminal. For a SPOT or TM CCT information about the record number, record
length, and record type and sub-type is output; for a RAE CCT a description of
the record type is produced. 
.B
The qualifier is intended primarily as a debugging tool, but may be used to
monitor the progress of the tape decoding operation.

.TP 15
.P -10;/DTI=DTI-file-spec
.P -2;-#Specifies the name of the DTI file to receive the Image Data from 
the CCT.
.B
The DTI-file-spec is parsed against the default 'LSL$DTI:SPOT.DTI' The
supply of a file-spec with the /DTI qualifier is therefore generally 
recommended to avoid subsequent confusion between the filename and the
actual imagery the file contains.
.B
The /DTI qualifier should be used in conjunction with the /IMAGE qualifier
to ensure that the image data is transferred from CCT to disk.
The size of the output DTI file is determined from the values associated
with the /START__SAMPLE /START__LINE /END__SAMPLE /END__LINE qualifiers.
These should be specified carefully, and with consideration to the available
free disk space.
.B
If the CCT contains Multispectral data a separate DTI file for each selected
band is created.  The band value is appended to the main part of the filename.
Thus if a filename of 'SPOT.DTI' is supplied ,and all 3 bands of a SPOT
multispectral image are selected for transfer, 3 files with the names
'SPOT1.DTI','SPOT2.DTI', and 'SPOT3.DTI' will be created. 

.TP 15
.P -10;/END__LINE=integer
.P -2;-#Specifies the last line of image data to be transferred.
.B
The integer value should be in the range 2 to 9999 and should exceed the value
supplied with the qualifier /START__LINE. If the /END__LINE  qualifier is not
given, a value equal to the number of lines in the CCT image is assumed. 
.B
The /END__LINE qualifier in combination with the /START__LINE qualifier is used
to determine how many columns will be present in the output DTI file.  If the
/END__LINE value exceeds the actual number of lines of image data on the CCT,
the /END__LINE value will be truncated to avoid the generation of a DTI file
with zero filled columns. The specification of an /END__LINE value rather than
the use of a default is generally recommended. 

.TP 15
.P -10;/END__SAMPLE=integer
.P -2;-#Specifies the last sample (pixel) of image data to be transferred.
.B
The integer value should be in the range 2 to 9999 and should exceed the value
supplied with the qualifier /START__SAMPLE. If the /END__SAMPLE qualifier is
not given, a value equal to the number of samples in the CCT image is assumed. 
.B
The /END__SAMPLE qualifier in combination with the /START__SAMPLE qualifier is
used to determine how many rows will be present in the output DTI file.  If the
/END__SAMPLE value exceeds the actual number of pixels per line of image data
on the CCT, the value will be truncated to avoid the generation of a DTI file
with zero filled rows. The specification of an /END__SAMPLE value rather than
the use of a default is generally recommended. 

.TP 20
.P -10;/EPHEMERIS
.I -10;/NOEPHEMERIS
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of an Ancillary record containing Ephemeris and
Attitude data on a SPOT STANDARD CCT.  The qualifier is not relevant when
reading a TM or RAE CCT. 
.B
The qualifier may be used alone on the command line to request decoding of
just the ephemeris data, or may be used with the /ANCILLARY or /HISTOGRAM
/CALIBRATION /PROJECTION /GCP qualifiers to control which classes of Ancillary
data record are decoded.
.B
The decoded information may be output to the terminal or to a data file using
the /LIST qualifier; to the line printer using the /PRINT qualifier, or to a
HDR text file in a 'keyword=value' format if the /HDR qualifier is supplied on
the command line.

.TP 25
.P -10;/GCP
.I -10;/NOGCP
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of an Ancillary record containing Ground Control
Point or Registration Control Point information on a SPOT STANDARD CCT.
The qualifier is not relevant when reading a TM or RAE CCT.
.B
The qualifier may be used alone on the command line to request decoding of
just the GCP or RCP data, or may be used with the /ANCILLARY or /HISTOGRAM
/CALIBRATION /PROJECTION /EPHEMERIS qualifiers to control which classes 
of Ancillary data record are decoded. 
.B
GCP information will only be present if the SPOT imagery has undergone Level 2
Preprocessing (geometric correction using map registration points). RCP
information will be present if Level S Preprocessing (geometric resampling to
achieve registration with another geometrically corrected SPOT scene) has been
applied.
.B
The decoded information may be output to the terminal or to a data file using
the /LIST qualifier; to the line printer using the /PRINT qualifier, or to a
HDR text file in a 'keyword=value' format if the /HDR qualifier is supplied on
the command line.

.TP 30
.P -10;/HDR=header-file-spec
.P -2;-#Specifies the name of the HDR text file that will receive information
decoded from any selected Header or Ancillary data records on the CCT. 
.B
The header-file-spec is parsed against the default 'LSL$DTI:SPOT.HDR'
The supply of a file-spec with the /HDR qualifier is therefore generally 
recommended to avoid subsequent confusion between the filename and the
data it contains.
.B
Information is written to the HDR file using a 'keyword=value(s)' format.  The
primarily use for this file is for DTI to HIPS conversion using the program
DTI__TO__HIPS. An example of the output format generated by using the /HEADER
qualifier with the /HDR qualifier, is given in this reference guide. 
.B
For a SPOT STANDARD or TM CCT the /HDR qualifier should be used in conjunction
with the /HEADER or /ANCILLARY /EPHEMERIS /CALIBRATION /PROJECTION /HISTOGRAM
/GCP qualifiers. Information decoded from other data records such as the
Trailer record, will not be recorded in the HDR text file.   For a RAE CCT
the /HDR qualifier should be used in conjunction with the /HEADER qualifier.
.B
The HDR file may be viewed or printed on a line printer using appropriate
system utilities.

.TP 15
.P -10;/HEADER
.I -10;/NOHEADER
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of a CCT Header record.
.B
On a STANDARD SPOT and TM CCT, the header record contains information relating
to the input scene (eg. Latitude and Longitude values of the scene centre),
and to the degree of correction that has been applied to the image as part of
preprocessing.  On a RAE CCT, the header records contain only a small amount of
information relating to each band of information present on the CCT. 
.B
The decoded information may be output to the terminal or to a data file using
the /LIST qualifier; to the line printer using the /PRINT qualifier, or to a
HDR text file in a 'keyword=value' format if the /HDR qualifier is supplied on
the command line.

.TP 15
.P -10;/IMAGE
.I -10;/NOIMAGE
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of CCT Image Data records, and their transfer to a
DTI file if the /DTI qualifier is also specified on the command line.
.B
In order to output the image data values to a DTI file, the /IMAGE qualifier
must be used with the /DTI qualifier.  The /START__LINE /START__SAMPLE
/END__LINE /END__SAMPLE qualifiers may be used to control which part of the
image is transferred, while the /BAND qualifier may be used to control which
bands of a Multispectral image are read.  
.B
A full SPOT scene has 6000 lines and 6000 columns of information, while a full
TM scene has 5965 lines and 6967 columns. It is therefore advisable to transfer
only the required area of interest if this can be determined beforehand. 

.TP 25
.P -10;/LIST=LIST-file-spec
.I -10;/NOLIST
.P -2;-#Directs output of any decoded record information to the terminal, or to
a specified text data file if the LIST-file-spec is present. 
.B
The default LIST-file-spec is SYS$OUTPUT, and therefore if the qualifier
/LIST is given without a file-spec, details will be output to the terminal.
.B
An example of how the information is tabulated is provided in the
reference guide. Note that in contrast to the HDR file generated using
the /HDR qualifier, a 'keyword=value' format is not employed.
.B
Only information on those records selected for decoding by the user is
output.  In many cases this information may only be relevant for debugging
purposes eg. information on the Volume Descriptor, File Descriptor and File
Pointer records is unlikely to be of interest to the general user.  For
Image Data records on a SPOT STANDARD or TM CCT, only information obtained
from the header part of these records, and not the actual data byte values,
are written to the terminal.
.B
Note that the /PRINT and /LIST qualifiers are mutually exclusive.  The
/HDR qualifier may however be specified with the /LIST qualifier in order
to produce a HDR text file.

.TP 20
.P -10;/NRSC
.I -10;/NONRSC
.P -2;-#Enables reading of remotely sensed imagery written on a CCT in
NRSC RAE format.
.B
The NRSC RAE format is the means by which the National Remote Sensing
Centre at RAE Farnborough generally supplies data from their archive of
imagery. The tape format is the same irrespective of the data source.
.B
The /NRSC qualifier indicates to the program that the CCT is in RAE format.
The following qualifiers may be used with the /NRSC qualifier: /BAND
/DEVICE /DIAGNOSTICS /DTI /END_LINE /END_SAMPLE /HDR /IMAGE /LIST /PRINT
/START_LINE /START_SAMPLE /SUMMARY   All other qualifiers are not relevant when
reading a RAE CCT.

subsequently spooled to the system line printer.  The temporary file
is always deleted after the information has been printed.
.B
An example of how the information is tabulated is provided in the

Note also that the information in the header part of Image Data records is not
considered for output if the /PRINT qualifier is present on the command line. 
.B
Note that the /PRINT and /LIST qualifiers are mutually exclusive.  The
/HDR qualifier may however be specified with the /PRINT qualifier in order
to produce a HDR text file.

/CALIBRATION /GCP /EPHEMERIS qualifiers to control which classes 
of Ancillary data record are decoded. 
.B
For a SPOT CCT, the fields in the Map Projection record will only be set if the
imagery has been geometrically corrected.  For Level 1A preprocessing the
information will be unset. 
.B
The decoded information may be output to the terminal or to a data file using
the /LIST qualifier; to the line printer using the /PRINT qualifier, or to a
HDR text file in a 'keyword=value' format if the /HDR qualifier is supplied on
the command line.

.TP 20
.P -10;/SCENE=integer
.P -2;-#Selects which scene from a number of scenes contained on a
STANDARD SPOT or TM CCT is to be read.
.B
A CCT may contain header, ancillary and image data records relating to a
number of scenes recorded sequentially on the CCT. The /SCENE qualifier
allows the user to select which scene is to be decoded - the first scene
on the tape is labelled 1, the second 2 etc.  Only information relating
to one scene may be decoded during a single run of READCCT - for CCTs
containing multiple scenes therefore repeated runs of the program with a
different /SCENE value are required to read all the information on the
CCT.
.B
The default /SCENE value is 1.

.TP 10
.P -10;/START__LINE=integer
.P -2;-#Specifies the first line of image data to be transferred.
.B
The integer value should be in the range 1 to 9999. The default value is 1.
The /START__LINE qualifier in combination with the /END__LINE qualifier is used
to determine how many columns will be present in the output DTI file.

.TP 5
.P -10;/START__SAMPLE=integer
.P -2;-#Specifies the first sample (pixel) of Image Data to be transferred.
.B
The integer value should be in the range 1 to 9999. The default value is 1.
The /START__SAMPLE qualifier in combination with the /END__SAMPLE qualifier is
used to determine how many columns will be present in the output DTI file. 

.TP 10
.P -10;/SUMMARY
.I -10;/NOSUMMARY
.P -2;-#Generates a table showing which data records are contained on the
CCT. 
.B
The /SUMMARY qualifier should be used in conjunction with the /LIST qualifier
in order to output the summary table to the terminal, or with the /PRINT
qualifier in order to output the information to the line printer.
.B
All the data records present on the CCT are included in the summary
irrespective of any other decode record qualifiers present on the command line.
The use of the /SUMMARY qualifier is recommended prior to the decoding of the
CCT in order to determine which records are present on the tape, and to
verify that the tape format conforms to the standard.

.TP 10
.P -10;/TEXT
.I -10;/NOTEXT
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of a Text data record on a SPOT STANDARD or
TM CCT. The qualifier is not relevant when reading a RAE CCT. 
.B
The information present in the Text record may be output to the terminal or to
a data file using the /LIST qualifier, or to the line printer if the /PRINT
qualifier is supplied on the command line. The Text information cannot be
output to a HDR text file.

.TP 10
.P -10;/TRAILER
.I -10;/NOTRAILER
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of a Trailer data record on a SPOT STANDARD
or TM CCT. The qualifier is not relevant when reading a RAE CCT.
.B
The /TRAILER qualifier should be used in conjunction with the /LIST or
/PRINT qualifiers in order to output the decoded information to the terminal or
to the line printer. The Trailer information cannot be output to a HDR text
file. 

.TP 10
.P -10;/VOLUME
.I -10;/NOVOLUME
.P -2;-#Enables decoding of a CCT Volume Descriptor record on a SPOT
STANDARD or TM CCT. The qualifier is not relevant when reading a RAE CCT.
.B
The Volume Descriptor is the first record on the CCT and contains
information on the CCT as a whole, including the volume sequence number
should the data span volumes.
.B
The use of the /VOLUME qualifier is not recommended, and is available for
debugging purposes only.  The qualifier should be used with either the /LIST
qualifier to write the decoded information to the terminal or to a text data
file, or with the /PRINT qualifier to output the information to the line
printer.

.P 0;This example illustrates how READCCT may be used to transfer image data
from a CCT in either SPOT STANDARD or TM format. The CCT is mounted on the
default tape device MT0:__ An area of interest of 1 - 1000 lines, and 1 - 1000
samples has been selected by use of the qualifiers /END__LINE and /END__SAMPLE
and use of the default START__LINE and START__SAMPLE values. Data for bands 6
and 7 have been selected, and therefore two DTI files with the names
'LSL$DTI:TM6.DTI' and LSL$DTI:TM7.DTI' will be created.  Note that the filename
supplied on the command line is parsed against the default 'LSL$DTI:SPOT.DTI',
and that the band number is appended to the main part of the filename.  Both
the /IMAGE and /DTI qualifiers must be supplied to enable the transfer of
imagery from tape to disk. No decoding of header or ancillary records has

These   messages  give information   only,    and require no
immediate action by  the  user.  They  are  used to  provide
information on  the  current  state  of the  program, or  to
supply explanatory  information in support  of  a warning or
error message.

^*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL1 ^*MESSAGES (ERROR)\*

These messages indicate an error in processing which has caused the program to
terminate.  The most likely causes are a fatal hardware error when
reading from the tape device, the CCT is not in the expected format causing an
error within a decoding function, or an incorrectly specified command line. 
.B
A READCCT error message is generated indicating the general problem area,
followed in many cases by a more detailed system error.
.B 2

.LM +4

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADENDLINE, END__LINE value is invalid
.JUSTIFY

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The value supplied with the /END__LINE qualifier
does not lie within the range 1 - 9999, or does not exceed the
START__LINE value.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with a new END__LINE
integer value.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADENDSAMPLE, END__SAMPLE value is invalid
.JUSTIFY

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The value supplied with the /END__SAMPLE qualifier
does not lie within the range 1 - 9999, or does not exceed the 
START__SAMPLE value.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with a new END__SAMPLE
integer value.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADQUAL, Bad command line qualifier
.JUSTIFY

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* A qualifier on the command line was incorrectly
specified.  The accompanying CLD error message will indicate the
precise problem.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Take corrective action and reenter the command line.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADSTARTLINE, START__LINE value is invalid
.JUSTIFY

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The value supplied with the /START__LINE qualifier
does not lie within the range 1 - 9999.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with a new START__LINE
integer value.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADSTARTSAMPLE, START__SAMPLE value is invalid
.JUSTIFY
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The value supplied with the /START__SAMPLE qualifier
does not lie within the range 1 - 9999.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with a new START__SAMPLE
integer value.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADTAPEFORMAT, Unrecognised tape format
.JUSTIFY

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The format of the record currently being read does
not correspond to the standard.  The most likely explanation is that the
tape is a RAE CCT and the /NRSC qualifier has not been supplied on the
command line, or the /NRSC qualifier is present and the tape is a TM or
STANDARD SPOT CCT.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Check that the CCT is of the expected kind, and that the
/NRSC qualifier has been supplied on the command line if appropriate. If a
problem remains then it probably means the tape format has been revised since
the last release of READCCT, and modifications to the program by Laser-Scan may
be required.  Inform Laser-Scan of the problem who may subsequently ask you to
to supply diagnostic printout.

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
ERRMTINIT, Error initialising tape device
.JUSTIFY
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* An error has occurred attempting to initialise the
tape device in preparation for the first read operation.  The accompanying
system warning message will indicate the precise reason for failure.  The
most likely reasons for failure are that the tape device specified using
the /DEVICE qualifier or the default tape device MT0: does not
exist on your system; the tape device is allocated to another user, or
the tape has not been mounted using the DCL command MOUNT with the
/FOREIGN qualifier.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Check whether the tape device MT0: or the device
specified on the READCCT command line exists; that the device is not allocated
to another user, or that the tape has been correctly mounted by using the
command SHOW DEVICE <tape device> /FULL 
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
ERRMTREAD, Error during tape read operation
.JUSTIFY
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* An unrecoverable error has occurred during a tape read
operation. The accompanying system warning message will indicate the precise
reason for failure.  In a number of situations this may be due to a hardware
error on the tape device, and in other situations may be due to a corrupt or
bad tape. 
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* If the system warning message indicates a tape device
error, report the problem to your system manager who may be able to suggest
appropriate action.  If the problem appears to be a corrupt block on the
tape confirm this by attempting to read the tape using the VMS DUMP utility.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
ERRMTREW, Error rewinding tape
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\* There was an error rewinding the tape.
.B
.P0; ^*User action:\* Check the tape and/or device  for malfunction.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
INVBAND, Band value out of range
.JUSTIFY
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* One or more of the integer values supplied with the
/BAND qualifier does not lie within the range 1 - 7.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with new band values.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
LINEOUTSIDE, START__LINE value outside image area
.JUSTIFY
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The integer value supplied with the /START__LINE
qualifier exceeds the actual number of image lines present on the CCT.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with a new /START__LINE
value.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
SAMPLEOUTSIDE, START__SAMPLE value outside image area
.JUSTIFY

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The integer value supplied with the /START__SAMPLE
qualifier exceeds the actual number of image samples present on the CCT.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with a new /START__SAMPLE
value.
.B

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
TOOMANYBANDS, Too many band values specified
.JUSTIFY
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* More than 7 integer values were supplied with
the /BAND qualifier.
.B
.P 0;^*User action:\* Reenter the command line with new band values.

.HL     1 ^^^*MESSAGES (OTHER)\*

In addition to the above messages which are generated by the
program itself,   other messages  may  be   produced by  the
command line interpreter (CLI) and by  Laser-Scan libraries.
In particular, messages may be  generated by the IFF library
and  by the  Laser-Scan  I/O library,  LSLLIB.  IFF  library
messages are introduced by   '%IFF' and are  documented in
the IFF library users' guide. In most cases IFF errors will
be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be the first
area of investigation. If the  cause of  the error cannot be
traced by the  user, and  Laser-Scan are consulted, then the
output  file should  be  preserved to  facilitate diagnosis.
LSLLIB  messages  are  introduced  by    '%LSLLIB' and are
generally self-explanatory.  They are  used  to  explain the
details of program generated errors.
