  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan IFF Map Processing (IMP) package consists of independent  modules
  which  together  form  a  powerful  data manipulation system within an automated
  mapping environment.  All the  modules  have  common  command  syntax  which  is
  decoded  using  the  Command  Line Interpreter as used by the VAX/VMS utilities.
  IMP modules all generate VMS format messages and set VMS DCL symbol  $STATUS  on
  image  exit.   In  command  files  the  success of a preceding IMP module may be
  tested using $STATUS before proceeding.  All  IMP  modules  are  comprehensively
  documented  in  the  IMP  Reference  Manual  and  the  documentation includes an
  explanation of messages output by  the  modules  together  with  suggested  user
  action.   All  IMP  modules  handle  IFF  HI  (HIstory),  ZS  (three dimensional
  strings), TS (Text Status), CB (coordinate block) and type 2 MD (Map Descriptor)
  entries.  (For a detailed description of these and the other IFF entries see the
  IFF Users Guide).  These  entries  could  not  be  handled  by  the  DAMP  ([3mDA[0mta
  [3mM[0manipulation  [3mP[0mackage)  utilities  which  IMP  was  designed to replace.  IMP is
  supplied with on-line help which is available via the VMS HELP utility.

  Four new IFF entry types are available for use with IMP programs.

      (i)  HI (HIstory) entry.  This is a mechanism  for  automatically  recording
           statistics  in  an  IFF file each time it is updated, so that it may be
           determined which users and programs contributed to the final  state  of
           the  file.   The HI entry contains up to 100 80-byte ASCII records each
           with the following format:

  Date        Time  Username     Program   Function     Elapsed  CPU      STATUS
  23-JUL-1986 12:22 CLARKE       IMERGE    Merge: rest  1:31:34 00:09:05 00000001


     (ii)  MD (type 2 Map Descriptor) entry, upwards compatible with the  existing
           type  1  MD.   This  entry  contains  projection,  scale  and  spheroid
           information etc.  It also contains an origin offset.  This is an  (X,Y)
           coordinate  pair, each held as a REAL*8 (double precision) number, that
           is added to any pair of coordinates in the IFF file to  give  the  true
           projection coordinates of the points.  This allows the absolute size of
           the coordinates in the IFF file, which are only held as REAL*4  (single
           precision)  numbers to be reduced, thus avoiding problems of truncation
           and reduced accuracy.

    (iii)  TS (Text Status) entry.  In the past IFF text  features  could  contain
           only  one  text  string, with associated location and descriptive data.
           With the introduction  of  the  IFF  TS  entry  text  features  may  be
           [1mcomposite[0m  -  that is composed of several sub-texts or text components,
           which may be manipulated independently or as a single entity.

     (iv)  ZS (3 dimensional string) entry.  The ZS 3 dimensional strings are held
           as  x,y,z  coordinates  in  a  similar  fashion  to  the existing IFF 2
           dimensional ST (STring) entries.

      (v)  CB (Coordinate  Block)  entry.   In  January  1988  the  CB  entry  was
           introduced  to replace the functionality of ST and ZS entries and offer
           the description of per-point attributes in addition to the  X,Y  and  Z

  This list may be compared with the IMP package details in the following section.
  All  major  DAMP  package  functionality is retained in IMP, although the module
  which provides that functionality may have changed.  In addition IMP offers many
  more functions than the DAMP package.

  [1m*[0m [1mICHECK[0m (vector data geometry checking)

      DAMP module equivalent:  CHKLP

          ICHECK is an IFF geometry checking utility.  It scans the coordinates of
          an  IFF  file  and  reports  on  the  following  potential errors within
          features or between features:

           o  loops within features, for example where the  digitiser  has  looped
              back upon itself,

           o  crossing features or touching features, IFF layers and feature codes
              may be selected,

           o  open features which do not  intersect  with  a  user  defined  sheet
              neatline  and  which start, or end, within a border zone offset from
              the neatline.

           o  feature characteristics at variance with the graphical type of  that
              feature.    The  graphical  types  are  read  from  a  FRT  (Feature
              Representation Table) file.


          Specific features may be selected for checking on the basis of IFF layer
          and/or  feature  code.   Text output may be directed to file, printer or
          terminal.  An option is provided to enable generation  of  an  IFF  file
          containing  error  markers  for  error  overlay  plotting.  An option to
          output a LITES2 command file is provided to enable automated  assistance
          in editing.



  [1m*[0m [1mICUT[0m (IFF feature manipulator)

      DAMP module equivalent:  none

          ICUT is a  utility  for  converting  selected  input  features  from  an
          existing  IFF  file.   Conversion is attained by imposing constraints on
          the selected  features.   The  resulting  features  (converted  and  not
          converted) are written to a new output IFF file.

          Features are selected on the basis of:

           o  IFF layer number,

           o  IFF feature codes.


          Constraints that can be set on the output features are:

           o  to limit the number of points contained in the features,

           o  to limit the length of the features,

           o  to restrict the output features to 2-dimensions,

           o  that the features do not contain invisible line breaks.


          In addition, the following attributes  of  the  input  features  can  be
          attached to the output features:

           o  height,

           o  feature code,

           o  feature serial number.




  [1m*[0m [1mIDIFFERENCE[0m ( IFF file comparator)

      DAMP module equivalent:  CMPIFF

          IDIFFERENCE is a program for comparing  two  IFF  files.   The  features
          inside them need not be sorted in order of feature serial number.

          The program detects:

           o  missing features (in either file),

           o  differences in feature code,

           o  differences in ancillary codes,

           o  differences in texts,

           o  changes in the coordinates within features.

           o  differences in the HI (HIstory),

           o  differences in the MD (Map Descriptor),

           o  differences in the RA (RAnge),

           o  differences in the CP (Control Point)

           o  and the CC (Cubic Coefficient) entries.


          Output may be directed to file, printer or terminal.

  [1m*[0m [1mIFILTER[0m (IFF string filtering and/or smoothing)

      DAMP module equivalent:  None, IFILTER is a new IMP utility.

          IFILTER is designed to smooth or filter, or smooth and then  filter  IFF
          strings using one of the following algorithms:


          FILTERS:

           o  least squares "BUNCH" filter,

           o  Douglas-Peuker filter.


          SMOOTHING OPTIONS:

           o  linear interpolation,

           o  Akima cubic interpolation.

           o  McConalogue cubic interpolation

           o  Bezier interpolation


          Smoothing and filtering takes place by default for all features  in  the
          file.   Alternatively  a restricted class of features may be selected on
          the basis of IFF layer or feature code.



  [1m*[0m [1mIFIXAREA[0m (area feature check and repair)

      DAMP module equivalent:  DAMP IFIX

          IFIXAREA is designed to read an IFF file and test for errors relating to
          area  features.   The  errors  to  be  checked  for are specified on the
          IFIXAREA command line, and may be any combination of the following:

           o  repeated adjacent vertices,

           o  'almost repeated' vertices - i.e.   adjacent  points  in  a  feature
              which  become  equal  when  their  co-ordinates  are  rounded to the
              nearest integer, or lie within a specified tolerance of each other,

           o  open features - i.e.  having at least three points and unequal start
              and end points,

           o  the direction of feature digitising (the usual  orientation  for  an
              area feature being anticlockwise)


          Checking  takes  place  by  default  for  all  features  in  the   file.
          Alternatively  a  restricted  class  of  features may be selected on the
          basis of IFF layer or feature code for checking.

  [1m*[0m [1mIINFO[0m (IFF file scan and summary)

      DAMP module equivalent:  IFINFO and SCI

          IINFO gives brief general information about the specified IFF file.  The
          default information given is as follows:

           o  full file specification,

           o  RA (RAnge) entry,

           o  HI (HIstory) entry,

           o  CP (Control Point) entry,

           o  optionally, MD (Map Descriptor) entry,

           o  information per overlay; number of features, number  of  points  and
              line length,

           o  information per feature code; number of features, number  of  points
              and line length,

           o  totals information,

              And optionally:

           o  the maximum and minimum values of any point heights, integer contour
              heights and real contour heights in the IFF file,

           o  a scan of all the entries in the IFF file,

           o  timings statistics based on the IFF HI (HIstory)  entry  values  for
              elapsed and CPU usage during the files history,

           o  interpretation and text output of  the  files  MD  (Map  Descriptor)
              entry.


          Output may be directed to terminal or printer.

  [1m*[0m [1mILAYFC[0m (IFF feature code reallocation - by whole IFF layer)

      DAMP module equivalent:  LIT

          ILAYFC enables the user to set all of the feature codes in one  or  more
          layers in an IFF file to specified values.

          Optionally ILAYFC processes in-situ on the input file.



  [1m*[0m [1mIMEND[0m (IFF file recovery)

      DAMP module equivalent:  MIF and IFT

          IMEND enables recovery of IFF files which have been improperly closed as
          a  result of system failure or operator error.  Options exists to update
          the RA (RAnge) entry after mending a file or to suppress the addition of
          EF,EO,EM and EJ entries which terminate an IFF file.



  [1m*[0m [1mIMERGE[0m (IFF file joining, layer selection or file splitting)

      DAMP module equivalent:  MER

          IMERGE is an IFF file merge utility.  It is used in four circumstances:

           o  After a map  has  been  digitised  on  LASERTRAK  and  processed  by
              LAPROCESS,  IMERGE  should be run to consolidate all the layer parts
              from different sessions, before further processing.

           o  To concatenate two or more IFF files into  a  single  map,  possibly
              offsetting the string coordinates using information from the IFF Map
              Descriptor entries.

           o  IMERGE can be used to merge out of the input file(s)  only  selected
              layers.  The layers are selected using the /LAYER qualifier.

           o  To split a single (or multiple) input IFF file(s) into two  separate
              output  files  on  the basis of IFF layer.  One output file contains
              all the features which lay within IFF layers selected from the input
              IFF  file(s)  and  while  the other contains the rest of the layers,
              i.e.  those which were not selected.  The output IFF files  may  use

  [1m*[0m [1mIPATCH[0m (IFF patch editor)

      DAMP module equivalent:  IED

          IPATCH is the IFF file patch editor.  It allows  the  user  to  inspect,
          edit or delete the various entries in the file.  The file is not copied,
          and changes made in write mode are performed in-situ.  As IFF files have
          serial  structure  it is thus not possible to add additional IFF entries
          nor re-write an entry of greater length than the original.

          The default mode of operation is to open the IFF file for reading only.

          IPATCH offers:

           o  optional journalling facility

           o  optional input from external command file

          IRENUMBER takes an IFF file and creates a new version  of  the  file  in
          which the Feature Serial Numbers (FSNs) are reallocated in monotonically
          increasing order.  IRENUMBER is intended mainly for recovery from  error
          situations  which have resulted in multiply allocated FSNs within an IFF
          file.

          IRENUMBER offers:

      DAMP module equivalent:  SELAC

          ISELAC reads an IFF file and writes selected features to a new IFF file.
          Feature selection is based on AC (Ancillary Code) type or on one or more
          of the attributes associated with an AC entry.  ISELAC utilises a series
          of  dynamic  command tables created from a user-defined 'skeleton' file,
          to offer greater AC selection flexibility.

          ISELAC offers the following features:

           o  command driven,

           o  dynamic command table definition,

           o  feature  selection  may  be  based  on  complex  attributes  in  IFF

      DAMP module equivalent:  None, ISTART is a new IMP utility.

          ISTART is designed to create an IFF file as a  pre-digitising  template.
          The  file  is  then  filled  with  data  captured  during the digitising
          process.  ISTART enables the user to specify  the  control  points,  map
          scale and origin offset information which are written to the template CP
          (Control Point) and MD (Map Descriptor) entries.   The  values  for  the
          control points may either be typed at the users terminal, or they may be
          coordinates captured from  a  manual  digitising  table.   The  LASERAID
          digitiser  may  then be started up in 'OLD' mode reducing the time spent
          by the user in poor lighting conditions typing in control point values.

          ISTART  creates  customer  specific  MH  (Map  Header)  entries  if  the
          appropriate  customer  command  qualifiers  are  specified.  In Ordnance
          Survey mode ISTART prompts for header information and then  generates  a
          grid in layer 0.  Laser-Scan MUART (Multi-UART) and TABLE_MONITOR driven
          digitising tables may be addressed.

      DAMP module equivalent:  DAMP I2TEXT and TEXT2I

          ITOTEXT and IFROMTEXT are two programs which have been designed for  the
          conversion  of  an  IFF file into text, and vice versa.  It is envisaged
          that ITOTEXT will be used for the conversion of data into text form  for
          transfer  to external customers, and IFROMTEXT for creating template IFF
          files, standard grids, etc.  The two programs can also be used to enable
          text  editing of IFF files.  This is done by converting an IFF file into
          text form using ITOTEXT, editing the text file, and creating a  new  IFF
          file from the edited text file using IFROMTEXT.

          ITOTEXT offers:

           o  optional output of addresses of IFF entries,

           o  a brief option, IFF entry mnemonics only, no entry contents,

           o  optional listing annotation with IFF entry addresses,

           o  optional output of coordinate values as  double  precision  absolute
              numbers, in a user defined format if required.


          Output may be directed to file, printer or terminal.

          IFROMTEXT offers:

           o  input may optionally be read from the terminal,

           o  optional comments in the text will be ignored,

           o  optional echo of text to terminal as input file is read,

  [1m*[0m [1mITRANS[0m (IFF coordinate transformation)

      DAMP module equivalent:  Projection computation and transformation functions
          of IPR

          ITRANS is a powerful general map projection program.

          It  allows  transformation  between  spheroidal   data   (latitude   and
          longitude)  and  specified  map projections and will also transform data
          from one map projection directly into another.

          Plane transformations ("empirical transformations") can also be  carried
          out.

          ITRANS is primarily intended for operation on data held  in  IFF  files,
          but it can also be used to transform individual points.

          ITRANS transforms coordinates from one coordinate system  into  another.
          It has no knowledge of any implied connection between these coordinates.
          Users must be aware, particularly when using data  sets  covering  large
          portions  of the earth's surface, that points that are close together in
          one system may be far apart on another  and  this  may  give  unexpected
          results when these points are adjacent vertices in an IFF feature.

          The MD (map descriptor) entry in the IFF file carries information  about
          the  projection that the coordinate data is currently held in.  Each run
          of ITRANS will ask the operator for details of the  required  projection
          and  the  data in the file will be transformed into this projection in a
          new IFF file with a corresponding MD entry.

          ITRANS can be used to edit an existing version 2  MD  entry  (or  insert
          one, if none exists) without transforming any of the coordinate data.

          The version 2 map descriptor contains the following information:-

         (i)  The local origin for the IFF file.


        (ii)  The scale of the map that the IFF file represents.

              This is a REAL*8 (double precision) number which when multiplied  by
              map  (or  sheet)  units gives IFF units - e.g. 50000.0 for a 1:50000
              map.

              It is used to relate IFF units to e.g. symbol and text sizes on  the
              map  sheet  and  also as a general indication of the accuracy of the
              digital data.

       (iii)  The spheroid that the data relates to.

              All  geographical  data  is  ultimately  related  to  a   particular
              spheroid.

              The spheroid is the geometrical model of the  earth  that  was  used
              when  the  original  survey  was carried out.  It is possible, using
              ITRANS, to convert data  from  one  spheroid  to  another,  but  the
              relationships  between  the  particular  geodetic  datums  that  the
              spheroids are part of must be known.

              The spheroids that ITRANS knows about are as follows:-

                      1) Those projections marked with * are only  defined
                      for a sphere, not a spheroid

                      2) Data can be held  in  spheroidal,  or  spherical,
                      coordinates   (i.e.   Latitude   and  Longitude)  by
                      specifying projection code 100.

                      3) When using projection  code  100,  it  should  be
                      noted  that  the  coordinates  are stored in the IFF
                      file  in  the  order  Longitude,  Latitude  as  this
                      corresponds  most  closely to X and Y on a cartesian
                      system.

                      4) In all LAMPS software a right  handed  coordinate
                      system  is  assumed.   ITRANS  only  produces  right
                      handed systems even when particular projections  are
                      traditionally used to produce left handed systems.


              The projections listed above specify the formulae to be used in  the
              projection,  but  in any particular case more data will be required.
              There is  provision  in  the  map  descriptor  to  store  up  to  15
              additional pieces on data as REAL*8 (double precision) numbers, such
              as projection zone, origin etc.


         (v)  The units that the data represent.
              The possible units in IFF files, and their codes are:
                     0 Unset
                     1 Feet (assuming projection units are metres)
                     2 Projection units (i.e. units used to specify spheroid)
                                These will be International metres, except for 
                                user-specified spheroids.

               DAMP module equivalent:   DAMP ICLIP


                   The clipping rectangle can be given explicitly using /NORTH,
                   /SOUTH, /EAST and /WEST qualifiers on the command line.
                   Alternatively it can be
                   extracted from the map header or control point entries.


                   IWINDOW offers: 


                    o  clipping of IFF 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional strings,


                    o  where 3 dimensional strings intersect with a clipping
                       boundary a Z-value
                       for the intersection point is calculated using linear
                       interpolation between the
                       two data points which straddle the boundary. The line
                       between the two points
                       is then clipped,


                    o  Ordnance Survey mode, which caters for the special
                       requirements of Ordnance survey map digitising,

                    o  selective clipping on the basis of IFF layer,


                    o  clipping to a void within the source map,


                    o  coordinate offset handling.

           *  At least a  4096  pages  working  set  per  process  is  needed  for
              efficient operation of the larger utilities.

           *  ISTART requires a Laser-Scan supported digitising table.  The  table
              may  either be on direct serial line to host computer, or controlled
              by a Laser-Scan MUART  (Multi-UART)  board.   Laser-Scan  should  be
              consulted  if  the use of a digitising table is considered as futher
              software development may be required.

          IMP modules run under OpenVMS Version 5.5-2, or  OpenVMS  AXP  V1.5  (or
          higher   version,  assuming  continued  upwards  compatability  by  DEC)
          concurrently with other interactive and batch processes.

          Laser-Scan  provide  all  relevant  interface  libraries.   Laser-Scan's
          LITES2  interactive  digitising and editing software running on the same
          host computer is recommended for digitising vector input data.  LASERAID
          automated   digitising   is  recommended  for  large  numbers  of  input
          documents.

          It is recommended that  the  reader  becomes  familiar  with  the  LAMPS
          Environment  Guide  which  outlines  in  greater detail the hardware and
          software environment required by the LAMPS package as a whole (of  which
          IMP is but a part).

          The main module in the STRUCTURE  package  is  ILINK,  an  IFF  geometry
          tidying   and  link-node  structuring  utility  offering  the  following
          features:

           o  Geometry idealisation:

                  Digitising inaccuracy can be corrected.

                  Duplicate feature sections can  be  merged  into  single  shared
                  features.

                  Features can be broken where they intersect.

                  Unique junction points can be created  where  features  meet  or
                  cross.


           o  Link/node data structuring of IFF files.


          The structured  data  generated  by  ILINK  permits  network  processing
          operations,  such  as  polygon generation, route planning, map colouring
          and structured data-base compilation.

          For more information on ILINK please see the separate STRUCTURE Software
          Product Specification (SPS).
