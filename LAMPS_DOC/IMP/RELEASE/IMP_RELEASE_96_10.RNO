.HL 1 ^*CONTENT\*
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software
package IMP. This package provides a collection of utility programs to
manipulate data held in Laser-Scan's internal feature format - IFF. 

.P 0
Details of IMP functionality and commands can be found in HELP, and in
the latest edition of the IMP Reference Manual. Supporting information
is to be found in the documentation for the MAPPING package.

.! customers who received software upgrades between releases.

This document is part of the LAMPS V4.5 release, which went into Alpha test
in September 1996. It covers changes to package IMP since the previous
LAMPS release (V4.4) which went into Alpha test in April 1995. See the
release notes for the previous LAMPS release for information about earlier
changes.

13-July-1995 - Modules GCTPLIB, ITRANS
.list
.LE;^*GCTPLIB\*#-#The Modified-Stereographic Conformal projection has been
added to the LSLMAINT package GCTPLIB, together with its five options defined
on the sphere as described in the ITRANS section below.
.LE;^*ITRANS\*#-#The Modified-Stereographic Conformal projection has been added,
together with its five options defined on the sphere:

.list
.le;  Miller Oblated Stereographic projection for Europe and Africa.
.le;  Lee Oblated Stereographic projection for the Pacific Ocean.
.le;  GS50 for the 50 US states
.le;  Modified-Stereographic projection for Alaska.
.le;  Modified-Stereographic projection for the U.S. bounded by a
near-rectangle.

References for these projections will be found in Map Projections - A Working
Manual by John P.Snyder (U.S.Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395).

Descriptor projection, Modified-Stereographic, when performing
IINFO/MAP__DESCRIPTOR.
.LE;^*IPATCH\*#-#The program has been relinked to pick up the new Map
Descriptor projection, Modified-Stereographic, when the user types `EXPLAIN'
whilst at the Map Descriptor (MD) entry.

27-Sep-1995 - Module ITRANS
.list
.LE;^*ITRANS\*#-#The program has been relinked to include a new maximum limit
of 800 control points when using the /CONTROL qualifier to specify a file of
coordinates to define a particular empirical transformation.

offset for the /ABSOLUTE qualifier (SPR 3084).

25-Jan-1996 - Module IFIXAREA
.list
.LE;^*IFIXAREA\*#-#A problem has been fixed where the /DFAD qualifier resulted
in points close together being deleted and then put back. This is because the
/DFAD qualifier is equivalent to /CLOSE, /NEAR and /REVERSE. If the penultimate
point was very close to the last, the last is deleted due to the /NEAR
qualifier and then put back with the /CLOSE qualifier. This has been rectified
so that the last is removed and the penultimate point is made the same as the
first (SPR 3093).

9-Oct-1996 - Module IINFO

"Information per Feature Code/Layer" output, certain FCs occasionally did not
appear (SPR 3497).

11-Oct-1996 - Module IFILTER

being closed. This is now fixed (SPR 3381).

15-Oct-1996 - Module ITRANS

.LE;^*ITRANS\*#-#The program had been modified so as to link with the
latest version of the GCTPLIB library in the LSLMAINT package. This fixes
the problem with Krovac projection transformations failing on AXP machines
(SPR 3246).
