.HL 1 ^^^&Notes on issuing and setting up LITES2 V2.9\&
LITES2 V2.9 includes some new licenced options and additional shareable
images which some customers will need. These are described to some
extent in the release notes, but some more details are given here.

.HL 2 ^^^&New licenced options\&
An example of the latest style
FAC file appears below. The new licenced options are:
.LIST
.LE; Z - allows the ENABLE Z command to be given. This treats Z as a
third coordinate rather than just a point attribute, so the cursor
may be positioned in 3D using POS, and START then digitises
in 3D. Many other commands also take account of Z.
This option is initially intended for use with the KERN DSR which
generates 3D coordinates, since no other interactive devices presently
work in 3D.
.LE; VIEW - allows the VIEW command which is used to generate rendered
views in additional display windows (VAXstation only). This also requires
a new shareable image, so "VIEW" should also be included as a component
of the LITES2 package in CUSTOMERS.RNO.
.END LIST

.HL 2 ^^^&New shareable images\&
Several components of LITES2 now come as separate shareable images, which
are invoked at run time only if required. This avoids other users having
this code wasting memory when they do not use it. We must take care to
ensure that customers get the images they need, and that LITES2INI sets
up the logical names to point to them.
.LIST
.LE; LSL$LITES2__GEOG__ROUTINES - this logical name should point to
LSL$EXE:LITES2GEOGSHR. This allows use of the commands GEOGRAPHICAL
and SHOW GEOGRAPHICAL, and the variables $LATITUDE and $LONGITUDE.
The issue procedure will be changed to always include this image
since this command is not licenced.
.LE; LSL$LITES2__VIEW__ROUTINES - this logical name should point to
LSL$EXE:LITES2VIEWSHR. Customers who purchase VIEW need both the
VIEW option in their LITES2 licence, and also the VIEW component in
CUSTOMERS.RNO.
.LE; LSL$LITES2__KERN__ROUTINES - this logical name should point to
one of two images, LSL$EXE:LITES2DSRSHR (for just a KERN DSR), or
LSL$EXE:LITES2KRISSSHR (for a DSR with KRISS). There is no option
in the licence for this - only customers purchasing it will receive
these images, by including DSR and KRISS as components of LITES2 in
CUSTOMERS.RNO. Note that only the VAXstation (UIS) version of LITES2
supports the KERN DSR. There is a new LITES2 - KERN DSR Workstation Guide
describing use of the DSR/KRISS.
.END LIST

.HL 2 ^^^&New bundled components\&
The UISMENUS system is now bundled with the UIS version of LITES2, so
anyone with the UIS component will automatically receive the UISMENUS
image plus examples. This is documented in the LITES2 - VAXstation (UIS)
Workstation Guide.
