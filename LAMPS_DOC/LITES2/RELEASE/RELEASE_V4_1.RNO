.HL 1 ^*CONTENT\*
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software
package LITES2. This package provides facilities for display and editing
of geographic and map data. 

.P 0
Details of LITES2 functionality and commands can be found using the HELP
facility in LITES2, and in the latest edition of the LITES2 Reference
Manual. Supporting information is found in the documentation for the
MAPPING package. 

.P 0
This document is for the LITES2 V4.1 release, which went into Alpha
test in December 1992. It covers relevant changes to package LITES2
since the previous LAMPS release (V4.0) which went into Alpha
test in May 1992. At that time, the extant version of LITES2 was described as
V4.0 of 9-April-1992. Another limited release (V4.0-1) went into Alpha test
on 29th July 1992. The changes in that version are included here also.

See the release notes for the previous LAMPS release for
information about earlier changes. 

.P 0
The current version of LITES2 is now V4.1 of 17-Dec-1992. LITES2MOTIF (only)
allows TRI font numbers greater than 32, includes some other minor changes
documented below, and has the version number V4.1-3.

.HL 1 ^*ENHANCEMENTS\*
The following particularly significant enhancements are included in
LITES2 V4.1
.LIST
.LE; The ability to "unload" IFF files without returning to INITIAL state
is provided (see QUIT n below). This reduces overhead, and hence provides
more production throughput when editing a series of similar maps. 
The Laser-Scan GIS products Horizon and Metropolis will also 
benefit from reduced resource requirements for long sessions.
.LE; The ability to read FRT, SRI, and TRI files while in READY state.
This allows a developer to experiment with different representations of the 
same data, which can be very useful when setting up a mapping system.
.LE; A new SEARCH command finds features in strict order of increasing
distance from the cursor (see SEARCH NEAREST below). This is of particular 
interest for GIS queries.
.LE; The MOTIF version is able to use the "Display PostScript" facilities
of the X-Windows system to draw high quality text. See below.
.END LIST 0

.PAGE
.HL 1 ^*INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES AND WARNINGS\*
Particular attention is drawn to the following changes in LITES2 V4.1, which
may result in behaviour incompatible with previous versions, or merit special 
warnings. The items are also
described in more detail in the appropriate section below.
.LIST
.LE; The QUIT command may now be followed by an optional integer, and will
then just "unload" that particular map. Such a command would previously
have been invalid. After using this command, there may be "gaps" in the map
numbers in use, and the number of maps may not correspond to the $MAPTOTAL
system variable. Files read subsequently will use the lowest available map
number. The $MAPSTATUS system variable may be used to determine whether a
particular map number is in use.
.LE; The FRT, SRI, and TRI commands may now be used in READY state. Care should
be taken if using this facility, that the new FRT information is compatible with
any IFF files currently loaded. If the new FRT, SRI, or TRI files have missing
codes, or codes which have graphical types inconsistent with the old ones, then
LITES2 may fail when these feature codes are used. 
.LE; The ENABLE HWTEXT command previously only had any effect in the SIG6000
version. In that version, its behaviour is unchanged, but in the other versions
it will now cause any text feature with a hardware bit set in the flags field
of the FRT to be drawn using hardware text. It is intended that this only be
used in the MOTIF version on a display which supports Display PostScript. Any
other use is likely to result in low quality text, or even no text at all.
.END LIST 0

.PAGE
.HL 1 ^*NEW OR CHANGED FACILITIES IN V4.1\*
The following facilities have been added, implemented or had their
actions altered:- 
.LIST
.LE
SPRs 1629 and 1895. The size of the LITES2 internal screen menu may now be
specified as a fraction of the screen rather than mm. This is done by giving
sizes in the range 0 to 1 to the DESCRIBE SCREEN command. Sizes greater than 1
are still taken as mm as before. Since sizes less than 1 were previously
illegal, this change is upwards compatible except for those using a menu
exactly 1mm in size.Any size larger than the screen will now be reduced to the
screen size. The positioning of menus on the MOTIF screen has been changed to
no longer allow space at the top of the screen for the old DECwindows icon box.
.LE
Access to bit images used as raster backdrop has been optimised. This improves
draw and plot times when monochrome backdrops are used.
.LE
Two new user routine calls are provided. These are completion user routines
invoked by returning a request code from USRRET. They are USRANO to provide
access to the functionality of the ANNOTATION command,
and USRDRW to provide access to the functionality of the DRAW command.
.LE
A new OPERATION (called FAR__MOVE__POINT) is provided to automatically set
attributes when points or features are moved by more than a user specified
tolerance. See new commands section below.
.LE; The FRT, SRI, and TRI commands may now be used in READY state. Unlike when
in INITIAL state, each command just reads its own file at the time the command
is given. This facility is provided mainly to assist in developing FRT files -
new codes could be added, or for example a pattern definition changed, and the
file then read in again. Care should be taken however that the new files are
compatible with any map data currently in use, i_.e_. all the feature codes
are present, and any changes of graphical type are to a similar type. It
is reasonable to change between line, curve, symbol string, and area, and also
from one type of symbol to another. Note that LITES2's spatial index for
a feature is not recalculated, so for instance if a symbol or text is changed to
one of a different size, then attempts to find it by a point on its bounding
box may fail.
.P 0
If the new FRT file has missing codes, or codes which have graphical types
inconsistent with the old ones (e.g. text instead of line), then LITES2 may
fail and enter its "collapse" routine when these feature codes are used.
.LE
The logical name LSL$UIS__MAX__COLOUR has been used in the UIS and MOTIF
versions to limit the number of colours used with the WORKSTATION 7000
setting. For the MOTIF version, the preferred logical name for this purpose
is now LSL$DECW__MAX__COLOUR, although the old version will still work.
.LE
The MOTIF version now supports X-Windows screens with a 'direct colour visual
type'. This means that it can draw correctly on 24 plane workstations (though
at present there is no advantage to the user over an 8 plane workstation).
.LE
The MOTIF version is able to use the "Display PostScript" facilities
of the X-Windows system to draw high quality text. See the LITES2 X-Windows
(MOTIF) Workstation Guide for details of how to enable the use of display
PostScript, and how to specify which fonts to use.
.P 0
The ENABLE HWTEXT command will now cause any text feature with a hardware bit
set in the flags field of the FRT to be drawn using hardware text. It is
intended that this only be used in the MOTIF version on a display which
supports Display PostScript. Any other use is likely to result in low quality
text, or even no text at all. Note that although LITES2MOTIF is able to
calculate the length of a hardware text string, and hence perform centre or
right justification without reference to the character widths in the TRI file,
this does not at present apply to using FPPPOSTSCRIPT in the PLOTTING package,
so one may still need a TRI file with accurate character widths.
.LE
The following new commands are provided:
.LIST 
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS '(',LL')'
.LE; New command ANNOTATION HWTEXT [n] enables (n absent, or 1) or disables
(n 0) the use of hardware text for annotations. Enabling this has the same
effect on annotation text as setting the hardware bit in the flags field of
the FRT does for map text.
.LE; New command PLOT HWTEXT [n] enables (n absent, or 1) or disables
(n 0) the use of hardware text for hardcopy plotting. Enabling this has the
same effect for hardcopy plotting as ENABLE HWTEXT does for screen drawing.
It is intended mainly for use with PostScript hardcopy plotting - other
versions do not support high quality hardware text.
.LE; SPRs 1057 and 1569. New command QUIT n (QUIT with an integer map number
after it) just unloads that particular map. It may be used in INITIAL state
(to remove an incorrectly specified map before it is read in), or READY state
(to remove a map which has already been read in). To preserve any edits made
to a map before unloading it, use the WRITE command (possibly with SELECT MAP n
and SELECT OUTPUT if more than one map is in use). The map being unloaded will
still remain on the screen until a redraw operation is performed (except on
a Sigmex or Tektronix display with segment store and ENABLE SEGMENTS, in which
case the map will be erased from the screen).
.P 0
If the map unloaded is not the one with the highest map number, then a "hole"
will remain in the list of map numbers in use. The system variable $MAPTOTAL
still holds with highest map number in use, which may not be the same as the
total number of maps in use. When a new map is read, it will use the lowest
available map number. The system variable $MAPSTATUS may be used to determine
the status of a particular map number.
.P 0
If all maps are unloaded while still in READY state, then when the first
map is read, the LITES2 working area will be set to its RANGE (plus the usual
5_% all round), possibly modified by a RANGE LIMITS command, and the ranges
of any raster images in use. The RANGE LIMITS command is now valid in READY
state, provided no maps are in use, to facilitate setting a new working area.
.P 0
It is now possible to move from INITIAL state to READY with no IFF files or
images (by using the MAPS 0 command) provided that RANGE LIMITS has been
used to specify a working area. There is no need to have given FRT, SRI, or
TRI file names, but these must be given before any IFF files can be read.
.LE; New command SEARCH NEAREST is similar to SEARCH ALL but finds the nearest
feature satisfying the search criteria. SEARCH NEXT then finds subsequent
features in order of increasing distance. SEARCH NEAREST can take much longer
that SEARCH ALL and should only be used when it is important that features
are found in order of distance.
.LE;SPR 1401. New command OPERATION FAR__MOVE__POINT sets a list of attributes
to be set when a point, or feature is moved by more than the tolerance
specified by TOLERANCE FAR__MOVE. This operation is performed after any others.
.LE;New command TOLERANCE FAR__MOVE sets the tolerance for the OPERATION
FAR__MOVE__POINT command.
.END LIST 0
.LE
The following new system variables are provided:
.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS '(',LL')'
.LE;$FILENAME n - the name of the specified text file (as used by the FILE
commands).
.LE;$FRT   - the name of the current FRT file.
.LE;$SRI   - the name of the current SRI file.
.LE;$TOPFC - the highest feature code defined in FRT file.
.LE;$TRI   - the name of the current TRI file.
.END LIST 0
.LE
Type 4 CITF Map Headers will now have the change indicator flags updated if the
OPERATION command is used to define the correct bit. The lookup table pointed
to by logical LSL$OS__MH__TABLE has fields CITF__MH__CH__IND__A to
CITF__MH__CH__IND__E which define the positions of the flags to be updated by
OPERATION flags 1 to 5 respectively.
.LE
LITES2MOTIF was updated on 11-Feb-1993 and now allows up to 127 TRI fonts, with
font numbers in the range 1-127. Logical name LSL$FRT__FONTMAX will have to be
defined as usual to access more than 5 fonts. The version number was changed to
V4.1-1 to indicate this change. The other versions of LITES2 will adopt this
new limit in the next release. The change was mainly intended for use with
Display PostScript text on the screen, and PostScript text in plots, when the
actual character shapes in the TRI are not used.
.LE
LITES2MOTIF was updated on 1-Mar-1993 to avoid a problem where an 'access
violation' error ocurred while deleting the screen menu (LITES2's own menu -
not UILMENUS). The error was rare, and tended to happen if there was other
screen activity while the menu was being deleted. The version number was
changed to V4.1-2 to indicate this change.
.LE
SPR 1682. LITES2MOTIF was updated on 10-Mar-1993 to attempt to improve the
generation of 'buffer zones' using the REGION ZONE command. When the feature
has tight curves in it, the zone generated should be less likely to have loops
in it. The algorithm is not yet perfect, and further enhancements are planned.
The version number was changed to V4.1-3 to indicate this change.
.LE
SPR 2166. LITES2MOTIF was updated on 10-Mar-1993 to fix a problem with the
_$MAP__SHEET system variable for Ordnance Survey (GB) maps. If the cursor
was within 0.5 IFF units of the right or top edge of the sheet, then the
name of the sheet to the right, or above was produced.
The version number was changed to V4.1-3 to indicate this change.

.HL 1 ^*PROBLEMS FIXED IN THIS RELEASE\*
This release corrects the following problems that have been found to exist
in LITES2 Version 4.0 :-
.LIST
.LE
SPR 1514 - It is now possible to use 4 buttons on a bitpad puck in LITES2MOTIF.
Previously LITES2 would only respond to buttons 1, 2, and 3, whereas it is not
now specific as to what buttons to expect from the X-Windows library. (The
implication is that even more buttons may well work if an input device had more
than 4.) This was actually fixed in V4.0 but was omitted from the release
notes.
.LE
A problem with the drawing of clipped hardware filled areas has been fixed.
This only applied when zooming in to relatively small but complex fill areas
which contained several holes. A workround to the problem was to define the
logical name LSL$DECW__HW__FILL to 0 to tell LITES2 to use software fill
instead. This workround was no longer needed when LITES2 V4.0-1 was used.
.LE
SPR 1818 - A problem with paragraph justifying a paragraph that has more than
one subtext on a line (for example a paragraph that has already been
justified) has been fixed. The previous version put all the subtexts at the
start of a line.
.LE
A problem with a possible 1 pixel error in registration of backdrops with
origin off the screen was fixed.
.LE
A change has been made to allow ENABLE NARROW to work, even when there are
raster images being drawn. This can be useful if previewing a narrow plot.
ENABLE NARROW always worked when plotting, but if previewed, window was
adjusted to screen and then the screen area was plotted.
.LE
A change has been made to avoid divide by zero if window is smaller than one
image pixel.
.LE
SHOW FC__PRIO of a feature code which was in the FRT but without a PRIORITY
record no longer produces the message 'FC -1 will be displayed...'. Instead,
the  correct FC number is given.
.LE
A problem with SHOW PATTERN has been fixed which could cause corruption of
FRT information within LITES2. This only occurred in unlikely circumstances
involving SHOW PATTERN of a FC with certain particular bit patterns present
in the hardware field.
.LE
SPR 1888 - The package-specific initialisation file LITES2INI.COM has been
modified to ensure that the symbol LITES2 is set to run an image that exists,
when running in batch mode (previously it was set to LITES2TEK4100).
.BR
SPR 1889 - Corrected bug, introduced in version V4.0, that set the logical
name LSL_$LITES2TERMINAL incorrectly on Motif Workstations.
.BR
Ammended, so that on X-terminals the workstation name is valid. Previously
it finished with a "/".
.LE
Avoid problems with the graphics transformation, resulting in the
cursor and highlighting being in the wrong position until a redraw was done.
This arose when images with non-square pixels were in use, after opening a plot,
drawing a plot, or drawing into a tertiary display.
.LE
Avoid error messages in the MOTIF version resulting from invalid values for
cap and join styles in the hardware field of the FRT file. These have tended
to result from what were intended to be numeric 'comments' at the end of
the FRT line being interpreted as a hardware field. It is recommended that all
FRT comments have a '_!' in front of them to avoid any chance of them being
read as numbers. Invalid hardware values are now treated as 0.
.LE
The LOOP command is now forbidden for a read-only map. Previously it would
attempt to perform the edit and get a less friendly IFF error.
.END LIST 0

.PAGE
.HL 1 ^*CHANGES TO ANCILLARY PROGRAMS FOR THIS RELEASE\*
This release includes the following changes to ancillary programs included 
with LITES2 Version V4.1:
.LIST
.LE;The following changes have been made to the Motif menu system utilities
UILMENUSMOTIF and UILGENMOTIF:
.LIST 
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS '(',LL')'
.LE;The WIDGET NAME command in UILGEN may now be used to give a name to a
PULLDOWN__MENU, so that the ADD and REMOVE actions in UILMENUS may be used.
Any attempt to use WIDGET NAME previously merely resulted in the name being
given to the first button within the menu.
.LE;The LABEL LABEL action in UILMENUS (used to change the text displayed in
a label widget, generated using the ADD TEXT command in UILGEN) may now be also
used to alter the text label of buttons, toggle buttons, pulldown menus, and
option menus.
.END LIST 0
.LE;
There is a new program in the LITES2 package, which is a LITES2 LCM macro
language preprocessor called LCMSQUASH. Its purposes are to speed LCM execution,
and to give a differentiation between source and executable.
See the LCMSQUASH User Guide for a full
description. Highlights are: 
.LIST 
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS '(',LL')'
.LE;LCMSQUASH reads a .LCM source file and creates a .LCM output file to 
contain the processed commands.
.LE;All LITES2 primary commands are reduced to 4 characters to minimise file
size. 
.LE;All comments are removed to minimise file size. 
.LE;Multiple statements are put on each line, to reduce record reading overhead.
.LE; Various diagnostics are produced to aid the developer in producing optimal 
code.
