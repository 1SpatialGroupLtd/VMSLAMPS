.HL 1 ^&BUGS FIXED\&
This release corrects the following bugs that have been found to exist
in  LITES2 Version 2.7 :-
.LIST
.LE; Avoid access violation when re-drawing with ENABLE SORT, and there
are no selected items in the window.
.LE; Comment out ASK TABLE command in the journal file. The command
should not be re-executed if the journal is re-played. 
.LE; Correct error message "attributes after n ignored" in EDIT
ATTRIBUTE.
.LE; Avoid errors in some version when a user routine deleted the old
feature and created a new one with a different feature code.
.LE; Ensure that thick lines in symbols/texts zoom along with the
rest of the picture (but not on segmented Sigmex 6000 series).
.LE; DISABLE THICK now suppresses thick lines in symbols/texts and fill
area borders/hatches, in addition to ordinary features.
.LE; Ensure that 2-point texts (with no RO entry) are drawn correctly.
.LE; In OS squaring (SQUARE WHOLE and SQUARE PART) ensure that fixed
end points are never moved, and ensure that list of fixed points is
not carried over from one feature to the next.
.LE; Avoid problems when PARAGRAPH command produced a line with a
single text component in the middle of the paragraph.
.LE; Avoid problems when FINDing circle arcs. They were occasionally
highlighted in the wrong place.
.LE; Avoid collapse which could occur if repeatedly constructing new
features into one map, and then changing them into another map.
.LE; Listed names in SHOW VARIABLES, PUCKS/MENUS, MACROS, COMMANDS
are not truncated to 12 characters now.
.LE; On a segmented display, ensure that selections of AC/CATEGORY/STYLE
were actually reflected on the display.
.LE; Ensure that all text components are considered in SEARCH/LOCATE TEXT.
.LE; Ensure that the construction is highlighted while doing an INCLUDE
PART (TEK__ARGS version was already OK).
.LE; Don't change the FC when doing CHANGE TCC on whole feature (not in
MODIFY (part) state).
.LE; SELECT FC for composite texts now refers only to the FC, and not to
the TCCs.
.LE; Allow for slightly increased text length if text is italicised
(negative font).
.LE; Ensure that edited flag is always set (provided ENABLE FLAGS) in
certain editing operations (EDIT VISIBILITY/ATTRIBUTES, TAKE ATTRIBUTES,
EDIT POINT, and LOOP).

.HL 1 ^&NEW OR CHANGED FACILITIES\&
The following facilities have been added, implemented or had their
actions altered:- 
.LIST
.LE; New commands
.LIST 'o'
.LE; DRAW commands to display various information on the graphics screen
.LIST ' '
.LE; DRAW POSITION/GEOGRAPHICAL/ABSOLUTE/SHEET - marks the cursor position
and writes its coordinate (in various units) on the screen.
.LE; DRAW TEXT/TITLE ... - write an arbitrary text string on the screen
(DRAW TEXT also marks the cursor position)
.LE; DRAW VECTOR - draws a line on the screen
.END LIST
.LE; EDIT CP - allows the corner points in the IFF files to be edited
.LE; OPERATION USER__FEATURE and USER__POINT, together with
CANCEL USER__FEATURE and USER__POINT, specify operations to be performed
on features created by a user-routine.
.LE; ROUTINE - like USER but allows choice of which user routine image
to use.
.LE; SHOW CP - lists the corner points of the maps
.LE; ENABLE IFFMAP - allows use of memory mapped files; useful when
LITES2 is being used for display purposes with small numbers of maps
.END LIST
.LE; New variables
.LIST 'o'
.LE; $MODTCC - the current text component code in MODIFY (part) state
.LE; $PRIVPOINT - true if the current point has a PRIVILEGE POINT
attribute
.LE; $TCC - the current text component code in TEXT state
.END LIST
.LE; LITES2 will now allow SYS$INPUT to be a mailbox (rather than a
terminal) if required, but note that it is impossible to transmit CTRL/C
via a mailbox. It has always been possible for SYS$OUTPUT to be a
mailbox, but now prompts and bells are sent to it in addition to
ordinary output. 
.LE; User routines 
.BL
The user routine interface has been redesigned.
.LIST 'o'
.LE; There is a new command ROUTINE n, which allows up to 10 more user
written images to be present.
.LE; The user written images are not mapped at image startup, but only
at the first call to the image. This means
.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS RL,")"
.LE; There is no need to assign a value to LSL$LITES2ROUTINES, if user
routines are not to be used.
.LE; LITES2 will start quicker, as it does not have to map the user 
rouitnes at image startup
.LE; There will be a slight delay the first time the USER command (or
ROUTINE n command) is given 
.END LIST
.LE; There is no need to supply routines that are not required.
.LE; There are alternative routines that can be called for obtaining and 
outputting coordinates, that allow the manipulation of composite text 
and features with point attributes.
.LE; There is no need to link the shared image with a transfer vector; 
however the required entry points must be made available with 
UNIVERSAL commands in the link file.
.LE; There are new example user routines and templates in new directories
LSL$PUBLIC__ROOT:[LITES2.ROUTINES.EXAMPLE] and [LITES2.ROUTINES.TEMPLATE]
.LE; Existing user routine images will still work with the new regime.
.END LIST
.LE; The new FRTLIB (with which LITES2 is linked) allows symbols in a
patterned area to be clipped to the boundary of the area.
.LE; If ENABLE DIAGNOSTICS, then signal any error which occurs whilst
initialising the table monitor.
.LE; OPERATIONs will now not update any attribute or AC which is on the
PRIVILEGE POINT list. THIS IS A NON-UPWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGE.
.LE; The POINT command is now valid for texts. It enables a particular
text component to be made current (only FIRST/LAST/NEXT/PREVIOUS were
possible before). All five commands do not now enter MODIFY (part) state
if given in TEXT state. THIS IS A NON-UPWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGE - anyone
requiring the old behaviour must follow these commands with a THIS
command. 
.LE; The ANNOTATION COLOUR command now allows arguments 0 - draw labels
in the background colour (this can be used to delete a label by drawing
over it again), and -1 - draw labels in the same colour as the feature
they are annotating.
.LE; The CLIP commands now allow invisible line segments to be clipped.
.LE; The INVISIBLE command may now be repeated in constructions,
producing multiple invisible segments. 
.LE; EXAMINE FC now also gives the text component code of sub-texts.
.LE; The ENABLE INVISIBLE command has been withdrawn. It was intended to
allow invisible line segments to be made visible, but was never actually
implemented.
.LE; The version of LITES2 for Westward terminals (LITES2TEK4100 with
WORKSTATION TYPE 1 1000) has been modified to suit monochrome terminals,
and will not for now produce colour output. In this version, ENABLE
BLINK applies to the whole refresh picture and not just the cursor.
.LE; Uses new IFF routine (in latest version of IFFSHR) that allows
faster drawing of features of graphical types 1,2,3,4,5,7,11 and 12
.END LIST
.BL 2
Details of all these commands can be found
in HELP and the latest edition of the LITES2 Reference Manual.
