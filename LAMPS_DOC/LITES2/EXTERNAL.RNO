.CENTRE;^*LITES2 - Facilites for external control\*
.FIG 2
.P 0
The Laser-Scan map editor LITES2 has several facilities which 
allow it to communicate with external processes, or external data. 
The main of these are:
.LIST 
.LE
LITES2 will run with its main command input stream (SYS$INPUT) coming
from somewhere other than the usual interactive terminal. The replacement 
is typically a VMS "mailbox" device which has been created and written to
by a separate driving program. An example use of this might be to use LITES2
as the map graphics presentation tool for a command and control system.
.LE
LITES2 has available a number of auxillary input streams, referenced as
LSL$LITES2AUX__n. These can be assigned to any VMS-supported serial device. 
This might be a mailbox (as above) driven by a second process such as one
interacting via pop-up menus. It might instead be a device such as a voice
recognition system. Use of these streams allows a single LITES2 process to
handle simultaneous input from several sources, interleaved. 
.LE
LITES2 now has the ability to write ASCII text output streams from the LITES2
macro command language. These would normally be used to create text files
(such as report files, or guidance command files for later execution), but
equally well could write to mailbox devices for interprocess communication. 
.LE
LITES2 has a powerful "user-routine" mechanism, by which user-written
program code can be activated from within the standard LITES2 image.
These user routines can carry out user-specific functions, usually
on graphic features which have been passed to the user routine from LITES2.
However, there are no real restrictions on what user routines can do,
and examples have already been written which carry out accesses to relational
databases. Equally, a user routine could carry out inter-process communication
by any of the standard VMS means (shared memory, mailboxes, semaphores,
locks...), and can return command lines to LITES2 for subsequent execution.
