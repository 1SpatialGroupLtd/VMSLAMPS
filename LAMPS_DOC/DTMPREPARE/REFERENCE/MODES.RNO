.P 0;^*Mode 1\* Intersect river/ridges with terrain data.

.P 0;This processing mode is invoked when the GO command is issued after the
ENABLE MODE INTERSECT command is given. The following tasks are performed by
this processing mode: 

.LM +4
.P -3;1._ The terrain data (contours, spot heights etc.) is loaded and
overlayed onto the river/ridge data. River/ridges are broken at every terrain
intersection.  The Z coordinate at each terrain intersection is set equal to
the terrain feature height. 

.P 0;These intersection nodes will be referred to as virtual nodes.  If an
intersection location is within the 'node__tolerance' of a physical node (a
river/ridge junction) then the terrain height is assigned to the node in place
of virtual node generation. 

.P -3;2._ Free-ends are marked and all free-end river/ridge links with length
less than that specified by the /CLIP qualifier from the nearest terrain
intersection are ^&deleted\&. This may create new free ends, so this process is
repeated untill no "short" free-end links remain. 

.P -3;3._ A new IFF file is created for each of the input river/ridge IFF files,
with the resulting broken and clipped river/ridges. 2D strings are converted
into 3D strings with the undefined value assigned to the Z coordinate (height)
except at terrain intersection points. 

.LM -4

.P 0;^*Mode 2\* Determine a height for every link end so as to give a
consistent flow within the river/ridge network 

.P 0;This processing mode is invoked when the GO command is issued after the
ENABLE MODE FLOW command is given. River/ridge link end heights are calculated,
but no river/ridge IFF file(s) are output.

.P 0;This mode provides a standalone mechanism for generating a check plot IFF
file which can be used for quality control purposes. The check plot IFF file is
generally displayed with river, ridge and terrain data in LITES2, or output to
a hardcopy device. 

.P 0;If there are any river/ridge nodes for which a height cannot be found,
their coordinates are written to a LITES2 command file, which must then be used
in conjunction with the LITES2 interactive cartographic editor to assist in the
interactive heighting of these nodes. 

.P 0;The following tasks are performed by this processing mode: 
.LM +4

.P -3;1._ The river/ridge network is loaded and a link-node structure is set up.
If there are any unheighted free-ends, these will be entered into the LITES2
command file (if the LITES command was given), a warning will be given and the
FLOW stage will terminate processing for this river/ridge file. 

.P -3;1._ The river/ridge network is traversed to establish the number of nodes
and the minimum height node and maximum height node within each river/ridge
network component (a network "component" being the largest part of the whole
network which is connected to any given point within the network). 

.P -3;2._ The direction of flow is determined in each link within the network
component.  This is achieved in stages as follows: 
.LM +4

.P -3;a)_ Flow is established down hill along a link from the maximum heighted
node, and up hill along a link from the minimum heighted node. 

.P -3;b)_ Heighted intersection nodes are visited and the closest nodes (one
link away) examined for height data so that one or both of the links can be
directed.  If either of the links can be directed then the other link can also
be directed. 

.P -3;c)_ Heighted intersection nodes are visited and all next heighted nodes
reachable up stream or down stream are examined. If the next heighted nodes are
either all greater than or all less to the visited node then the start link
can be directed. If the start link cannot be directed then the same process is
repeated on the other side of the visited two arm heighted node. 

.P -3;d)_ The minimum and maximum heighted nodes and two arm heighted nodes
are visited. Starting at these positions the network is traversed until a
heighted node (target) is found. The target node must have flow directed along
the link into it which is in the same sense as the flow directed along the
link away from the start (visited) node.  The network is further traversed to
try and establish the shortest path from the visited node to the target node.
If while traversing the network a height node is found to be closer than the
current target node, then this new node will become the target. Once the
shortest path is found between the visited node and the target node, then all
links along this path can be directed. 
.LM -4
.P -3;5._ Heights all unheighted nodes within the link node structure. This
involves calculating the longest combine path up hill and down hill along
directed links from each unheighted node to all heighted nodes within a
network component.  Once the longest combine path was found, all unheighted
nodes along this path are heighted.  The process is repeated until all
unheighted nodes in each network component are heighted.  The heighting node
algorithm relies on there being flow into and out of the unheighted node. A
data error will result if this criteria is not met. Should this occur then an
entry will be made in the LITES2 command file (if the LITES command was given). 

.P -3;6._ Checks all links in a final pass routine. This pass attempts to
direct those links which have not been directed earlier.  If a link cannot be
directed at this stage then a data error will result. Should this occur, then
an entry will be made in the LITES2 command file if the LITES command was
given. 

.P -3;7._ Creates a check plot IFF file.  The purpose of this file is to
provide a mechanism of checking the flow derived.  This can be a powerful tool
when overlaid on river/ridge data to enhance the information
displayed. 
.LM -4

.P 0;^*Mode 3\* Interpolate heights along each river/ridge feature

.P 0;This processing mode is invoked when the GO command is issued after the
ENABLE MODE INTERPOLATE command is given. This mode is designed to height all
vector data within a river/ridge network. The tasks performed by this
processing mode are described as follows: 

.LM +4
.P -3;1._ All tasks defined in mode 2 above are first performed. The check-plot
option is not available within this mode. If any node height cannot be
determined for any reason, an error will occurr and the process will terminate.
In other words, the FLOW process must be completed successfully before the
INTERPOLATE process can be used.

.P -3;2._ Heights are Interpolated along each river/ridge feature.

.P -3;3._ 3D River/ridge IFF files, of similar structure to the original 2D
river/ridge IFF files, are output.
