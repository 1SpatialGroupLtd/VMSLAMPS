.CHAPTER ^*^&RIV3D - 3 DIMENSIONAL RIVER/RIDGE LINE INTERPOLATION\& \*

.INDEX PANACEA>User guides>RIV3D

.HL1^*^&INTRODUCTION\&\*

.P 0;The purpose of RIV3D is to accept 2 IFF files, one which contains a river 
network which has been digitised in 2D and the second which contains contours
again as 2D features. The river file is read into the program and any river 
ends that are within a specified tolerance are joined together to form nodes 
and so a link node structure is built up at run time to represent the river 
network. Once the link node structure has been built up for the rivers the 
rivers are overlayed on the contours and all the intersections between the 
rivers and contours are stored. These stored river/contour intersections are
subsequently used to calculate the heights of the river nodes, along with the 
network information where required. 

.P 0;The RIV3D software can also cope with ridgeline information and will treat 
this in the same way as the river information so all the information in the 
data preparation section will still apply. The main difference between the 
river and the ridge information is that ridges should not really be flat but 
may change their direction of fall whereas rivers may be flat but should 
definitely not change their direction of fall. Rivers and ridges at the present 
time should be put through the software in two different runs causing the 
production of two output files containing spot heights or 3D strings.

.P 0;The input to the RIV3D program will be taken from LSL$IF:(filename).IFF 
unless one specifies another default directory for the program too look in.

.P 0;Output from RIV3D may take one of three forms, IFF 2D spot heights, IFF 3D 
strings or PANACEA break lines. In all cases unless otherwise specified the 
output will be directed to LSL$IF:(filename).IFF in the case of IFF 2D or 3D
output or (filename).BRK in the case of PANACEA break line output.

.P 0;To produce the output heights the software takes one river at a time and
then interpolates heights between the contour/river intersections if the 
distance between any two of these intersections is greater than the user 
specified length, as specified with the maxlen command. The method of 
interpolation is linear. The first points to have their heights calculated are 
the nodes, this being done by looking up and down river for the 
closest intersections that are not the same height and then using the distance 
from each intersection to the node position and the height of each intersection 
to linearly interpolate the height of the node.
If the nodes at the end of a river have been attributed
heights then the whole of the river will be spot heighted, but if the either 
node has not been heighted then the section of river from the node to the first 
intersection with a contour will be undefined.

.HL1^*^&DATA PREPARATION\&\*

.P 0;When data is being used with RIV3D certain data preparation points should 
be taken into account, these points are:

.list
.le ;As RIV3D tries to form a network of the rivers/ridges it is supplied the 
data ^*MUST\* effectively be in a link node form but without the nodes being 
explicitly nominated. This being the case when digitising a network one should 
ensure that at the confluence of two or more rivers all the features flowing 
into and out of the confluence either begin or end at the confluence, figures 
1a and 1b illustrate the correct and incorrect ways of producing river 
data for the software. One may not break a river feature at a confluence ^*IF\* 
one for some reason wishes to segregate part or parts of the river network.

.le ;One should remember that any end section of a river that is left hanging 
in space will be ignored as there is no way too attribute a height to the river 
end node, and hence this section of the river will be lost in the output file. 
To overcome this problem one may add supplementary contours in the form of short 
straight lines close to the "free" river end or small rings around the "free" 
river end.

.le ;The contour file should be checked to see if the case as in figure 2 
occurs as this can lead to the node at position ^*X\* being attributed with a 
height greater than that of the contour ^*Y\* hence river ^*Z\* would change 
its direction of fall, as indicated by the flow arrows. If this is not checked 
for before RIV3D is run on the data, then the situation should be born in mind 
when examining any rivers which according to the log file change direction of 
fall.

.le ;If the touch tolerance is given too larger value then it is possible for 
ends of river which are not in fact related to be pulled together onto one 
node. This problem is illustrated by figures 3a and 3b. When this happens 
many of the rivers produced will change direction of fall, and hence warnings 
will be issued in the log file associated with the run. It is possible to get 
an idea of the suitability of the touch tolerance chosen, by when running the 
software interactively one should note the number of nodes that it says it 
forms. If there are a large number of rivers but very few nodes it would tend 
to indicate that the tolerance is too great, and conversely if there are a large 
number of nodes it could indicate the tolerance is too small. The number of 
nodes produced will also depend on how discontinuous the river network is. A 
reasonable figure would be in the range of 1/4 - 3/4 of the total potential 
number of nodes, where the total potential number of nodes is number of rivers
_* 2. The default tolerance is greatest map range / 500.
