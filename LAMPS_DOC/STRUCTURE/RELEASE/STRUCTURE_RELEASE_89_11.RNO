This document describes the recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software
package STRUCTURE. This package provides an IFF link-node structuring and
manipulation utility. STRUCTURE also incorporates powerful geometry tidying
capabilities.

This document covers changes to the package STRUCTURE since the previous
general release of LAMPS software, which was frozen ready for issue on
17-AUG-1989. At that time, the extant version of STRUCTURE was described as
v4.4 of 04-APR-1989. See the STRUCTURE release notes for the previous LAMPS 
release for information about earlier changes.

.P 0;ILINK is an IFF link-node structuring and manipulation utility. ILINK also
incorporates powerful geometry tidying capabilities.

.P 0;ILINK provides the following functions:
.LIST "o"
.LE ;^*link-node structure\* generation.
.LE ;^*alignment of lines with lines\* (ie. feature alignment). 
.LE ;^*merging of duplicate line sections into single features.\*
.LE ;^*joining of line ends to lines\* (viz. joining feature ends to any point
along a feature, including points along line segments between original feature
vertices). 
.LE ;^*joining of feature ends to ends\*.
.LE ;^*breaking features into separate features where they cross\*
.END LIST 

.P 0;One-point features are treated as zero length linear features. 

.P 0;Structured data can be used for many network processing operations, such
as polygon generation, route planning, map colouring and data-base
compilation.

.INDENT -4;MISSFC, missing or invalid feature code at line 'integer' of /FCC
file 
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* ILINK expected but was unable to read a feature code
on the specified line of the FCC file.
which most probably lies outside of the specified range.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Check the offending line in the FCC file against the
definition of FCC file syntax given in the description section above. Ensure
that all feature codes lie within the range 0 - 32767, that there are no
non-numeric characters within feature codes and that all feature code range
specifications of the form M:N do have an integer value for 'N'.

.INDENT -4;NOIFFRA, IFF RA entry not found
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The input IFF file did not contain a valid RA
entry.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Investigate cause of the missing RA entry. Read the file
into LITES2 and then use the LITES2 'EXIT' command to correct the range entry.

.INDENT -4;NOJNSTR, no junction structure
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* An ILINK operation, such as /SORTARMS, has been
requested which requires a junction structure to be present in the
input IFF file, but this was not present. 
.P 0;^*User action:\* Use ILINK to create a junction structure first.
The /SORTARMS qualifier can be used either together with /STRUCTURE,
or on its own.

.INDENT -4;TOOMNYAPN, too many arms per node - maximum allowed is 'integer'

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* A node has been found with more arms than the
data structure used by ILINK will allow. This number is very high so
this error should never arise, but if it does it is probably due
to the specification of an excessive /JNTOL tolerance.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Check the /JNTOL tolerance value is correct relative both
to the coordinate system defined in the IFF file and to the
length of the shortest features in the IFF file. If it is found that the input
geometry does actually possess nodes with higher degree than ILINK has allowed
for, this should be reported and the maximum number of arms per node will be
increased within reason.

.INDENT -4;TOOMNYARMS, too many arms - maximum allowed is 'integer'

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* Processing has formed a junction with more arms than the
data structure used by ILINK will allow. This number is very high so this error
should never arise, but if it does it is probably due to the specification of
an excessive /JNTOL tolerance. 
.P 0;^*User action:\* Check the /JNTOL tolerance value is correct relative both
to the coordinate system defined in the IFF file and to the length of the
shortest features in the IFF file. If it is found that the input geometry does
actually possess junctions with higher degree than ILINK has allowed for, this

.P 0;^*Explanation:\* FCP file contains more than the maximum number
of different feature codes permitted.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Try using less feature codes, possibly by
making maximum possible use of the /LAYERS layer selection qualifier,
or by running ILINK several times with separate FCP files.

.TEST PAGE 7
.INDENT -4;TOOMNYFTRS, too many features - maximum allowed is 'integer'
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The maximum number of features allowed for when
memory was allocated by ILINK has been exceeded. There are either too mny
features in the input file or or else the error has resulted from the creation
of new features during ILINK processing.  New features are generated when
features are broken into separate parts where they cross. This happens during
several of the available ILINK operations, not just in /BREAK. Even
when /BREAK is not specified, features are always broken where they cross
and are reconstituted on output as necessary. 
.P 0;^*User action:\* Increase the number of features which ILINK
should allocate memory for, using the /BPF qualifier (average number of Breaks
Per Feature during processing). A large /BPF value value will cause
more memory to be allocated to receive the expected increase in the number of
output features. 


.BLANK
.TEST PAGE 7
.INDENT -4;TOOMNYNDS,  too many nodes - maximum allowed is 'integer'
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The maximum number of nodes allowed for when
memory was allocated by ILINK has been exceeded. This is because
the number of nodes allowed for is equal to twice the number of
features allowed for, which may have been too low.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Increase the number of features which ILINK
should allocate memory for, using the /BPF qualifier (average number of Breaks
Per Feature during processing). A large /BPF value value will cause
more memory to be allocated to receive the expected increase in the number of
output features.

.P 0;^*User action:\* please submit an SPR and ILINK will have its maximum line
count increased. 

.BLANK
.TEST PAGE 7
.INDENT -4;TOOMNYPRFCS, too many different feature codes suitable for
processing - maximum allowed is 'integer' 
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* ILINK has analysed the FRT file specified with the /FRT
qualifier. There is insufficient memory to hold all the feature codes which
have been read from the FRT file and have been flagged as suitable for ILINK
processing. The input data must have very complex feature coding.

.P 0;^*User action:\* Ensure that there are not redundant feature codes in the
data and the FRT file. Try using less feature codes, possibly by making use of
the /LAYERS qualifier, in conjunction with running ILINK several times with
separate FRT files. 


.BLANK

.INDENT -4;TOOMNYPTS, too many points - maximum allowed is 'integer'
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The maximum number of points allowed for when
memory was allocated by ILINK has been exceeded.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Increase the number of features which ILINK
should allocate memory for, using the /BPF qualifier (average number of Breaks
Per Feature during processing). A large /BPF value value will cause
more memory to be allocated to receive the expected increase in the number of
output features.

.INDENT -4;TOOMNYPRFCS, too many different feature codes rejected for
processing - maximum number of rejects allowed is 'integer' 
.FILL
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* ILINK has analysed the FRT file specified with the /FRT
qualifier. There is insufficient memory to hold all the feature codes which
have been read from the FRT file and have been flagged as unsuitable for ILINK
processing. The input data must have very complex feature coding.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Ensure that there are not redundant feature codes in the
data and the FRT file. Try using less feature codes, possibly by making use of
the /LAYERS qualifier, in conjunction with running ILINK several times with
separate FRT files.

.INDENT -4;TOOMNYSHFTRS, too many shared features - maximum allowed is 'integer'
.FILL
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* The maximum number of shared features allowed
for when memory was allocated by ILINK has been exceeded.
.P 0;^*User action:\* Increase the number of features which ILINK
should allocate memory for, using the /BPF qualifier (average number of Breaks
Per Feature during processing). A large /BPF value value will cause
more memory to be allocated to receive the expected increase in the number of
output features. 



.BLANK
.TEST PAGE 7
.INDENT -4;SPACELIM, insufficient workspace - maximum workspace available is
'integer' bytes 
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* ILINK has attempted to allocate memory for more points
and features than is permitted by the user's virtual-page-count limit. 
.P 0;^*User action:\* Either reduce the number of points and/or
features which ILINK is attempting to allow for, or, if this is
not possible because the file to be processed is simply too large,
then the VMS system virtual page count limit must be increased.

.P 0;If this is not possible, you will have to divide the IFF file into
two or more separate file, process these separately and then merge
them together again.

.P 0;However, if this course of action is taken it will not be possible
to obtain junction structure for the whole file by merging
together each of its structured parts. 

.P 0;If a junction structure is required over the final whole area
then this ^*must\* be produced using ILINK on the whole file. This will
often be possible, even though ILINK could not run the /LLJOIN,
/LPJOIN or /BREAK processes on the whole file due to lack of virtual
memory space, because these require address space for every feature
point whereas the PPJOIN and STRUCTURE operations do not require
address space for feature points but only for a fixed small amount of
data per feature.

.INDENT -4;UNEXPEOF, unexpected end of IFF file
.P 0;^*Explanation:\* This message indicates there is something seriously wrong
with the IFF file which has caused immediate termination of the program. ILINK
has detected the end of the IFF file, but has not detected an IFF 'EJ' entry. 
.P 0;^*User action:\* Use IMEND on the file, which will correctly position the
EOF marker and insert an EJ entry at the end of the file.  Re-run  ILINK on 
the corrected file.

In addition to the above messages which are generated by the
program itself,   other messages  may  be   produced by  the
command line interpreter (CLI) and by  Laser-Scan libraries.
In particular, messages may be  generated by the IFF library
and  by the  Laser-Scan  I/O library,  LSLLIB.  IFF  library
messages are introduced by   '%IFF' and are  documented in
the IFF library users' guide. In most cases IFF errors will
be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be the first
area of investigation. If the  cause of  the error cannot be
traced by the  user, and  Laser-Scan are consulted, then the
output  file should  be  preserved to  facilitate diagnosis.
LSLLIB  messages  are  introduced  by    '%LSLLIB' and are
generally self-explanatory.  They are  used  to  explain the
details of program generated errors.
