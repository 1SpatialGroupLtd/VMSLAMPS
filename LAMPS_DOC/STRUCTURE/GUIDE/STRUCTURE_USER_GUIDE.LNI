            Documentation for new  utility,  ICASE,  added  to  reference  manual.
            ICASE  is  suited  to  the  production  of  large scale schematic road
            casings and `area fills as  often  seen  in  road  atlases.   Given  a
            junction  structured  IFF file containing road centrelines, a table of
            feature codes, priorities and road widths, the program will create  an
            output  IFF  file  containing  road  casings  and  area  fills for the
            selected features.  It is important to realise  that  the  input  road
            centreline  data  must  be  geometrically  clean  to  prevent spurious
            results occurring.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is an overview of STRUCTURE  and  is  intended  as  a
            quick  reference  guide  to  the  salient  features  of  the STRUCTURE
            package.

            There then follow summary User Guides for the individual modules which
            comprise  STRUCTURE.   Each  individual module contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the STRUCTURE module.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the modules does

            FORMAT              - a summary of the module command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            FSN 'integer' ('integer')
                                  FSN  followed by two integer arguments indicates
                                  an IFF feature serial number. The integer number
                                  enclosed   in  round  brackets  is  the  feature
                                  internal sequence number.

            00003DE7              A  hexadecimal  address  of a location within an
                                  IFF file.  STRUCTURE  modules  express  all  IFF
                                  addresses  using hexadecimal radix.  The address
                                  is  always   padded  with  leading  zeros  to  a
                                  standard field width of 8 characters.

            STRUCTURE utilities use the VMS Command Line Interpreter (CLI) to  get
            and  parse the program command line.  STRUCTURE utilities thus offer a
            VMS emulating user interface.  Unfortunately the VMS  Digital  Command
            Language  (DCL)  does  not support the real (or "floating point") data
            type.  Many STRUCTURE utilities require real value arguments  for  the
            specification   of   tolerances  and  distances  etc.   To  meet  this
            requirement, Laser-Scan have developed an enhanced CLI  based  command
            line  decoding  mechanism.  This enables the interpretation of numbers
            as either "real" or "integer".  Throughout this  document  the  number
            types  are  differentiated  by the words 'integer' for integer numbers
            and 'real' for real (or "floating point") numbers.

            The STRUCTURE package consists of independent modules  which  together
            form  a  powerful  structured  IFF data manipulation system within the
            LAMPS  automated  mapping  environment.   LAMPS  is   the   [1mL[0maser-Scan
            [1mA[0mutomated  [1mM[0map  [1mP[0mroduction  [1mS[0mystem.   Readers are also referred to the
            collection of manuals on VMS produced by Digital Equipment Corporation
            for the detailed command structure and facilities.

            It is recommended that  the  user  becomes  familiar  with  the  LAMPS
            Environment  Guide  which  outlines  in  some  detail the hardware and
            software environment required by the LAMPS  package  as  a  whole  (of
            which STRUCTURE is but a part).

            All the STRUCTURE modules have common command syntax which is  decoded
            using  the  Command  Line  Interpreter  used by the VAX/VMS utilities.
            STRUCTURE modules all generate VMS format messages and set $STATUS  on
            image  exit.   In  command  files the success of a preceding STRUCTURE
            module may be tested using $STATUS before proceeding.   All  STRUCTURE
            modules  are  comprehensively  documented  in  the STRUCTURE Reference
            Manual and the documentation includes an explanation of  all  messages
            output  by  the  modules together with suggested user action.  Not all
            STRUCTURE modules handle IFF ZS entries (three dimensional strings).

            IFF stands for [1mI[0mnternal [1mF[0meature [1mF[0mile and is the Laser-Scan vector file
            format  generated  by  LASERAID  and other Laser-Scan mapping systems.
            IFF is used as the data  structure  throughout  the  Laser-Scan  LAMPS
            system.  IFF files are binary and cannot be manipulated directly using
            a text editor.  The STRUCTURE package enables the user  to  perform  a
            wide  range  of  structured  data  manipulation  tasks  related to the
            requirements of the automated mapping industry.   Within  the  VAX/VMS
            system  IFF  files  can  be  treated  as  any other file type for file
            management purposes.  To enable the user to instantly  distinguish  an
            IFF  file  from  a  file of another type IFF files have by default the
            file extension '.IFF'.

            To provide great flexibility in the production environment  IFF  files
            are  referenced  by  all  the  STRUCTURE  modules  using  logical name
            LSL$IF:.  (For an explanation of logical names see  volume  2  of  the
            VAX/VMS  document set).  Logical name LSL$IF:  is assigned to a device
            and directory specification either using the VMS ASSIGN command or the
            Laser-Scan  SI  utility.  Use of the SI utility is described in detail
            in the IFF User Guide.  If a device and directory are not included  in
            a command line file specification, all the STRUCTURE modules will look
            for the file in the device and directory pointed  to  by  the  logical
            name  LSL$IF:.   The assignment made to LSL$IF:  at login time is site
            dependent and may not point to the location of your IFF files.  It  is
            most  important that the user remembers this and becomes familiar with
            the SI command.

            Once logged in the user must  give  two  commands  to  initialise  the
            STRUCTURE  package  before  any  IFF manipulation can take place.  The
            first command  is  STRUCTUREINI  and  should  be  issued  thus:   (see
            footnote for explanation of presentation conventions)

                      $ [1mSTRUCTUREINI[0m

            The STRUCTUREINI command invokes a command procedure which  defines  a
            DCL symbol (the module name) for each of the STRUCTURE modules.  After
            using STRUCTUREINI the user need only type the symbol name to activate
            the  chosen  module.   STRUCTUREINI  also  installs  process dependent
            STRUCTURE message definitions.  These allow the user  to  examine  the
            text represented by the condition code placed in DCL symbol $STATUS by
            all STRUCTURE modules on image exit.

            As an alternative to explicitly typing the STRUCTUREINI  command  each
            time  the  user  wishes to use the STRUCTURE package, the STRUCTUREINI
            command may be placed  in  the  users  login  file,  or  in  the  site
            dependent default login file.

            The second command which must be  given  before  using  the  STRUCTURE
            package  is  the  SI command.  The SI command assigns the logical name
            LSL$IF:  (or IF:  for short)  to  the  device-directory  specification
            which  contains  the  IFF  file(s)  that  are  to be manipulated.  For
            example:

                      $ [1mSI[0m [1mDUA3:[BUREAU.TRIALS.DIGITISING][0m

            This will assign logical name LSL$IF:  to  the  device  and  directory
            specification DUA3:[BUREAU.TRIALS.DIGITISING]

            The modules are described in alphabetical order.  Each  module  has  a
            very  brief  section  outlining  its  functionality, the format of the

            ILINK is an IFF geometry tidying and structuring utility.  It can join
            feature  [1mends[0m  [1mto[0m  [1mends[0m,  [1mends[0m  [1mto[0m  [1mlines[0m  (i.e.  to any point along a

            vertices),  or  [1mlines[0m  [1mto[0m [1mlines[0m (ie.  feature alignment).  It can also
            merge duplicate feature sections into single features, break  features

            [1mstructure[0m.

            One-point features are treated as linear features with zero length.

            Structured data can be used for many  network  processing  operations,
            such   as  polygon  generation,  route  planning,  map  colouring  and
            data-base compilation.

  [1mFUNCTION[0m

            RELHT assigns relative heights to the ends of all links in a  junction
            structured IFF file.  RELHT requires for input the junction structured
            IFF file and an ASCII file containing a user defined table of  feature
            code  height priorities.  The junction structured file may be produced
            by either ILINK or LASERAID.

            The relative height coding for the ends of each  link  are  placed  in
            type  10 and type 11 AC (Ancillary Code) entries for the start and end
            of each link respectively.

            The junction structure is not preserved in the output file.

            The relative height coding may be  used  to  determine  which  feature
            "lies  on  top of" another for reprographic and GIS applications.  For
            example, the relative height information may be used  to  ensure  that
            motorway  features  are plotted as a continuous feature, while a river
            feature  would  be  broken  where  it  intersects  with  the  motorway
            features.

  [1mFUNCTION[0m

            ICASE is suited to  the  production  of  large  scale  schematic  road
            casings  and  area  fills  as  often  seen  in  road atlases.  Given a
            junction structured IFF file containing road centrelines, a  table  of
            feature  codes, priorities and road widths, the program will create an
            output IFF file  containing  road  casings  and  area  fills  for  the
            selected features.

            It is important to realise that the input road centreline data must be
            geometrically clean to prevent spurious results occurring.

            Note that for small scales work, it is often easier to  generate  road
            casings   'on   the  fly'  during  display  and  plotting,  using  the
            prioritised multiple representation capabilities of FRTLIB now used in
            LITES2 and FPP.
