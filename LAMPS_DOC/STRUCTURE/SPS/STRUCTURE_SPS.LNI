            1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

            The Laser-Scan STRUCTURE package is  a  structured  IFF  creation  and
            processing package.  The package operates on Digital Equipment VAX and
            Alpha AXP series computers running the  VMS  operating  systems.   See
            later sections for details of hardware and software prerequisites.  It
            is recommended that  the  reader  becomes  familiar  with  the  "LAMPS
            Environment  Guide"  which  outlines  in  some detail the hardware and
            software environment required by the LAMPS  package  as  a  whole  (of
            which STRUCTURE is but a part).  LAMPS is the [1mL[0maser-Scan [1mA[0mutomated [1mM[0map
            [1mP[0mroduction [1mS[0mystem.

            The acronym IFF stands  for  [1mI[0mnternal  [1mF[0meature  [1mF[0mormat.   IFF  is  the
            Laser-Scan   vector  file  format  generated  by  LASERAID  and  other
            Laser-Scan mapping systems and used as the data  structure  throughout
            the  Laser-Scan  LAMPS  system.   IFF  files  are binary and cannot be
            manipulated directly using  a  text  editor.   The  STRUCTURE  package
            offers the user to a variety of geometry idealisation options and also
            provides the option for generation of IFF link  node  data  structure.
            The  link/node  structured  IFF data data can be used for many network
            processing operations, such as polygon generation, route planning, map
            colouring and data-base compilation.

            Although all data input to the STRUCTURE package utilities must be  in
            IFF  format, conversion software is available to transfer a variety of
            commonly used customer formats  to  and  from  IFF  format.   See  the
            CONVERT   package   SPS  for  details  of  supported  customer  format
            conversions.

            The STRUCTURE package consists of independent modules  which  together
            form  a  powerful  data structuring system within an automated mapping
            environment.  All the modules have  common  command  syntax  which  is
            decoded  using  the  Command  Line  Interpreter  as  used  by  the VMS
            utilities.  STRUCTURE modules all generate VMS format messages and set
            VMS  DCL  symbol $STATUS on image exit.  In command files, the success
            of a preceding STRUCTURE module may be  tested  using  $STATUS  before
            proceeding.   All  STRUCTURE modules are comprehensively documented in
            the STRUCTURE Reference  Manual  and  the  documentation  includes  an
            explanation  of messages output by the modules together with suggested
            user action.

            The  following  computer  hardware  requirements  are  needed  to  run
            STRUCTURE.

             o  Any DEC VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or Alpha AXP computer supported
                by the current version of VMS.

             o  At least 2MB available disc space for  software,  plus  sufficient
                for data files.

             o  At least 8192 page working set per process for  efficient  use  on
                typical  datasets,  16384  page working set per process for larger
                datasets.

             o  At least 30000 page virtual address space per process for handling
                of typical datasets, more for larger datasets.

             o  Any DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal.




            2.2  [3m[1mSoftware[0m [3m[1mprerequisites[0m

            STRUCTURE modules run under OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2, or OpenVMS  AXP
            V6.1  (or  later  version,  assuming continued upward compatibility by
            DEC).   STRUCTURE  modules  may  be  run   concurrently   with   other
            interactive and batch processes.

            The prerequisite Laser-Scan MAPPING package provides IFF and FRT  file
            interface libraries.

            The Laser-Scan LITES2 interactive digitising and editing  software  is
            recommended for digitising vector input data.

            It is recommended that the reader  becomes  familiar  with  the  LAMPS
            Environment  Guide  which  outlines in greater detail the hardware and
            software environment required by the LAMPS  package  as  a  whole  (of
            which STRUCTURE is but a part).

            4  [3m[1mRESTRICTIONS[0m


            1.  ILINK will not detect cases where a  feature  intersects  with  or
                doubles  back  on  itself.   It is recommended that such loops are
                detected using the ICHECK tool of the  IMP  package,  and  removed
                using the LITES2 editor before running ILINK.

            2.  ILINK, like all geometry handling  programs,  has  to  handle  the
                infinite  precision  of  mathematical  geometry  within the finite
                precision of computer arithmetic.  This means that it has to apply
                tolerances  to  all  positional  comparisons,  which  it does in a
                self-consistent manner.  However, care should be  taken  not  skip
                stages  in  ILINK  processing  (on  the  grounds  that  equivalent
                processing has been done by a different program) as the algorithms
                and  tolerances  may  not  match.   In  particular, the /BREAK and
                /FREE_ENDS qualifiers should  only  be  used  on  data  which  has
                previously been processed using /LPJOIN and /PPJOIN.

            3.  ILINK will not retain invisible moves within features, but instead
                will create independent features for each visible section.

          [1mILINK[0m (IFF data tidying and structuring)

            ILINK is an IFF geometry tidying  and  link-node  structuring  utility
            offering the following features:

             o  Geometry idealisation:

                    Digitising inaccuracy can be corrected.

                    Duplicate feature sections can be merged  into  single  shared
                    features.

                    Features can be broken where they intersect.

                    Unique junction points can be created where features meet.


             o  Link/node data structuring of IFF files.


            The structured data generated  by  ILINK  permits  network  processing
            operations,  such as polygon generation, route planning, map colouring
            and structured data-base compilation.

            Six geometry idealisation options are available:

            OPTION 1 (LPJOIN)    - Feature-end to feature joining.   This  process
                                   is useful when feature ends fall just short of,
                                   or project just over other features,  or  where
                                   features   are  required  to  move  onto  point
                                   features which are close to them.  For example,
                                   railway lines being moved so as to pass exactly
                                   through railway stations.

            OPTION 2 (PPJOIN)    - Feature-end  to   feature-end   joining.    For
                                   example,  where  a  digitised network such as a
                                   road map needs to have feature ends within some
                                   small tolerance brought together to arrive at a
                                   unique point

            OPTION 3 (LLJOIN)    - Feature  alignment.   For  example,   where   a
                                   polygon  map  has been digitised as a series of
                                   closed polygons and these are  required  to  be
                                   aligned.

            OPTION 4 (MERGE)     - Feature merging.  For example, where a  polygon
                                   map  has  been  aligned  as  a series of closed
                                   polygons and these are required to be merged so
                                   that  duplicate boundary sections become single
                                   shared-features.

            OPTION 5 (BREAK)     - Breaking  features  where  they   cross.    For
                                   example,   where   a   wire-frame   perspective
                                   projection  is  required  to  be  broken   into
                                   separate  line  features  between  every  point
                                   where lines cross, so that hidden line sections
                                   can subsequently be edited out manually.

            OPTION 6 (FREE_ENDS) - Reporting free  ends.   All  free  ends  (1-arm
                                   nodes)  are  found  and  reported,  either to a
                                   LITES2 command file or as point features  in  a
                                   separate final IFF layer.

            In addition to the geometry idealisation options ILINK  also  provides
            IFF link/node structuring.

            OPTION 7 (STRUCTURE) - This  option  is  useful  when  the   link-node
                                   structure  resulting  from  the  ends with ends
                                   joining operation described above, is  required
                                   for  subsequent  processing.   For example, the
                                   compilation of a structured data base or  route
                                   planning.

            OPTION 8 (SORTARMS)  - Junction Structure 'arm' sorting.  The arms  in
                                   the   IFF   JB  (Junction  Block)  node_to_link
                                   pointer entries are sorted (in situ) into order
                                   of   increasing   orientation  angle  (measured
                                   anti-clockwise from the positive x axis).

            Because each of the above options is independent,  they  can  be  used
            individually,  or can be applied successively to transform an image in
            a series of iterative steps.

            This makes ILINK very flexible; for example, the following sequence of
            ILINK command lines:

                   $ [1mILINK[0m [1minfile[0m [1mfile1/PPJOIN/JNTOL=4<CR>[0m

                   $ [1mILINK[0m [1mfile1[0m [1mfile2/LPJOIN/JNTOL=4<CR>[0m

                   $ [1mILINK[0m [1mfile2[0m [1mfile3/LLJOIN/JNTOL=1.5<CR>[0m

                   $ [1mILINK[0m [1mfile3[0m [1mfile4/MERGE<CR>[0m

                   $ [1mILINK[0m [1mfile4[0m [1mfile5/BREAK<CR>[0m

                   $ [1mILINK[0m [1mfile5[0m [1moutfile/STRUCTURE<CR>[0m


            will result in joining ends with ends; followed  by  joining  ends  to
            lines; followed by feature alignment; followed by merging; followed by
            breaking lines where they touch or  cross;  and  finally  producing  a
            link/node structured IFF output.

            Specific features may be selected for processing on the basis  of  IFF
            layer  and/or  feature  code.   All other features will be transferred
            from input to output IFF files unchanged.

            The positions of any unattached link ends and zero  length  links  may
            optionally  be  recorded  in a LITES2 guidance file.  This facilitates
            semi-automatic editing of the IFF  data  using  the  LITES2  graphical
            editor.

          [1mRELHT[0m (IFF feature relative height coding)

            RELHT assigns relative heights to the ends of all links in a  junction
            structured IFF file.  RELHT requires for input the junction structured
            IFF file and an ASCII file containing a user defined table of  feature
            code  height priorities.  The junction structured file may be produced
            by either ILINK or LASERAID.

            The relative height coding for the ends of each  link  are  placed  in
            type  10 and type 11 AC (Ancillary Code) entries for the start and end
            of each link respectively.

            The junction structure is not preserved in the output file.

            The relative height coding may be  used  to  determine  which  feature
            "lies  on  top of" another for reprographic and GIS applications.  For
            example, the relative height infomation may be  used  to  ensure  that
            motorway  features  are plotted as a continuous feature, while a river
            feature would be broken where it intersects with the motorway.

            The junction positions of any doubtful link  ends  may  optionally  be
            recorded  in  a LITES2 guidance file.  This facilitates semi-automatic
            editing of the IFF data using the LITES2 graphical editor.

            RELHT offers the option of an ASCII output file to contain a  list  of
            the  coordinate  position and the number of arms for all the junctions
            in the input IFF file.

          [1mICASE[0m (generation of road casings and area fills)

            ICASE is suited to  the  production  of  large  scale  schematic  road
            casings and area fills as often seen in road atlases.

            Given a junction structured IFF file containing  road  centrelines,  a
            table  of  feature codes, priorities and road widths, the program will
            create an output IFF file containing road casings and area  fills  for
            the selected features.

            It is important to realise that the input road centreline data must be
            geometrically clean to prevent spurious results occurring.

            Note that for small scales work, it is often easier to  generate  road
            casings   'on   the  fly'  during  display  and  plotting,  using  the
            prioritised multiple representation capabilities of FRTLIB now used in
            LITES2 and FPP.
