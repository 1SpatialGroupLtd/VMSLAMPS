DTMCREATE binary file internal structure		22-Oct-1991
----------------------------------------		-----------

DTMCREATE communicates data between its component programs using three binary
transfer files. By convention thse have the following file extensions:

.DTA - contains the primary point data, scaling factors and internal sectored
 spatial index data
.NOD - contains the inter-node relationships
.DER - contains first order slope derivatives

All three files are unformatted binary written using FORTRAN i/o.
All integers are 32 bit. Floating point are VAX 32 bit F reals.


.DTA file contents
------------------

First data provide scaling parameters, and data ranges, to convert from 
internal integer grid back to real coordinates.
	
LIMPOL		Number of imaginary point around border
NP		Total number of points (including imaginaries)
NPMAX		Max possible number of points
NBI		Number of boxes in X - internal sectoring
NBJ		Number of boxes in Y
MX2		Top right corner of internal box structure X
MY2		Top right corner of internal box structure Y
MXI		Grid interval of box structure - X
MYI		Grid interval of box structure - Y
ISHELL		Internal system flag - can be ignored
VMINX		Minimum X value read in and represented on integer grid
VMAXX		Maximum X value read in and represented on integer grid
VSCALX		X Scaling factor between internal grid and real world coords
OFFSETX		X offset into integer grid for VMINX (0)
VMINY		Minimum Y value read in and represented on integer grid
VMAXY		Maximum Y value read in and represented on integer grid
VSCALY		Y Scaling factor between internal grid and real world coords
OFFSETY		Y offset into integer grid for VMINY (0)
VMINZ		Minimum Z value read in and represented on integer grid
VMAXZ		Maximum Z value read in and represented on integer grid
VSCALZ		Z Scaling factor between internal grid and real world coords
OFFSETZ		Z offset into integer grid for VMINZ (75000)

The next section contains the actual node data set and next point in box
markers for each point. There are NP*5 integers to read, ordered...

Finally, further internal use box markers. These can be ignored. 



.NOD file
----------
This contains the lists of neighbours for each node in turn. Structure is, 
for each of the NP points (all 32 bit integers):

NODE_NUMBER		Node number in .DTA file
NUMBER_OF_NEIGHBOURS	Number of neighbours for that node
NEIGHB_1		The neighbours, by .DTA file number, in point order
.
.
.
NEIGHB_n                (where n is number_of_neighbours)


.DER file
---------
This contains the slope derivatives for each node, in order of nodes in the 
.DTA file.

Data are coefficients of quadratic expansion, where applied. If quadratic fit 
inappropriate, a linear fit is applied and only the first two terms are 
set; X2,XY and Y2 are set to 0.0. 

Data are, (all 32 bit VAX F reals) for each point:

CX
CY
X2
XY
Y2
