.BR;^^^*MODULE TRIDER (slope derivative estimation)\*

.P 0;TRIDER takes as input the binary files which define the triangulation
structure created by TRIANG (or output by TRIEDIT) and estimates the first
derivatives of slopes at each node within the triangulation. Output is to a
binary file which is used as input to TRIGRID. 

.P 0;TRIDER offers the following features:

.LIST "o"

.LE
four options for estimation of Z values for "imaginary points"
outside the area for which source data is available.  This greatly
enhances edge matching between DTMs.

.LE
produces a disk file containing the slope derivatives for each node
in the triangulation.  This may be rapidly read into the DTM generating
module (TRIGRID) each time a grid of differing resolution is required.

.LE
provides "most often required" default settings for all options.


.LE
offers user option of graphical output showing progress of derivative
estimation.

.LE
is command driven.

.LE
offers command file operation to reduce operator error rate and use of
"guidance files" for training, demonstrations, and semi/fully-automated 
operation.
