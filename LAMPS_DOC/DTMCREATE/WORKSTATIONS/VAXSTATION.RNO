.HL 1 ^^^*Introduction\*
This document describes the workstation dependent facilities available
when operating DTMCREATE on Digital VAXstation workstations. It is
to be read as a supplement to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual and in
particular Appendix A of that manual. 

.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Display\*
A single graphics display is supported, this may have either 4 or 8 planes.

.P 0
It is normal to login on the VAXstation by creating a new VT220 window,
but a second terminal can be used, in order to avoid having the alphanumeric
window and the graphics window on the same screen. 


.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Shareable Images\*
All DTMCREATE utilities now use a shareable image pointed to by the logical
LSL$DTM__GHSSHR. This is defined by DTMCREATEINI to point to an image
appropriate to the graphics device being used. The new DTMCREATE images are
LSL$EXE:DTM__GKSMOTIFSHR.EXE for MOTIF, LSL$EXE:DTM__GKSUISSHR.EXE for UIS
and LSL$EXE:DTM__GKSNULLSHR.EXE for a non-graphical device.



.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Interactive devices\*
In addition to the login keyboard, DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT is capable
of interpreting commands from a digitising table on a separate terminal
line, or the VAXstation mouse.

.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Digitising table\*

.P 0;The digitising table input is interpreted by DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT
using the Table Monitor system.
.P 0
To use the Table Monitor, a table monitor process must be started, using
program STARTMON. If the 'named monitor' option is used, then logical
name LSL$MONITOR__TABLE must point to the serial line. In addition, if
the table is anything other than a standard ALTEK, then logical table
LSL$TABMON__ROUTINE (or LSL$TABMON__ROUTINE___<terminal_> for named
monitor) must point to a suitable decoding shareable image. This logical
name must be available to the table monitor process, and so should be in
the group or system logical name table. 


.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Graphics Interaction\*
.P 0;The DTMCREATE Reference Manual assumes by default that the user
is logged onto a VAXstation. It is assumed that when running module TRIEDIT, GIN
(Graphics INteraction) is via the VAXstation mouse or bitpad. The DTMCREATE
Reference Manual refers to GIN button presses in terms of "left", "middle"
and "right" buttons, for "point", "master point" and "end" respectively.

.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Keyboard\*
If a VAXstation VT220 window is used as the login terminal, keyboard input
is taken from the VAXstation keyboard. If a separate VT100 (or equivalent)
terminal is used as the login terminal, keyboard input is expected from that
keyboard.


.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*DTMCREATE graphics lookup file setup\*

.P 0;DTMCREATE module graphics options are controlled by three lookup files
which are accessed via logical name LSL$LOOKUP: The files are CONFIGURE.DAT,
CONFIGDEF.DAT and TERMTYPE.DAT. For details of the purpose and content
of these files see Appendix A to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual.

.P 0;The lookup file TERMTYPE.DAT contains the graphics device definition
for each terminal line and is referenced by DTMCREATE modules TRIANG, TRIDER 
and TRIGRID. The following entries are required to enable use of TRIANG,
TRIDER and TRIGRID on a VAXstation if a VT220 window is used as the
login device:
.LITERAL

WTA1:		GPX
WTA2:		GPX
WTA3:		GPX
WTA4:		GPX
WTA5:		GPX
WTA6:		GPX
WTA7:		GPX
WTA8:		GPX
.END LITERAL
.P 0;If a separate terminal is used as the login device, for example
TTB3: then the following typical entry is needed:
.P 0;TTB3:	GPX


.P 0;DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT uses a lookup file, LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGDEF.DAT, to
select and initialise the default hardware configuration for your particular
terminal line at your site. Alternatively you may specify on the startup
command line the hardware options that you wish to use, or select hardware
options (but not graphic screen type) while you are running the program by
using the ENABLE command. If you choose to select your own hardware options
TRIEDIT checks in another site dependent lookup file,
LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGURE.DAT, that the desired options are available (and are in a
valid combination) and then initialises the devices accordingly. 


.P 0;Valid entries in either of the TRIEDIT graphics lookup files, for 
use when the login device is a VAXstation VT220 window are:

.LITERAL

WTA1:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA2:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA3:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA4:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA5:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA6:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA7:		GPX MOUSE 
WTA8:		GPX MOUSE 

or:

WTA1:		GPX TABLE 
WTA2:		GPX TABLE 
WTA3:		GPX TABLE 
WTA4:		GPX TABLE 
WTA5:		GPX TABLE 
WTA6:		GPX TABLE 
WTA7:		GPX TABLE 
WTA8:		GPX TABLE 

.END LITERAL
.P 0;Additional entries must be made if additional terminal lines are to be 
used for the login device, for example:
.P 0;TTB3:	GPX TABLE

.P 0;Note that for TRIEDIT graphical interaction MOUSE and TABLE are mutually
exclusive. No other GIN (Graphics INteraction) options are allowed e.g.
TRACKERBALL or THUMBWHEELS.
