.HL 1 ^^^*Introduction\*
This document describes the workstation dependent facilities available
when operating DTMCREATE on Sigmex 6100 and 6200 series displays. It is
to be read as a supplement to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual and in
particular Appendix A of that manual. 

.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Display\*
A single graphics display is supported, this may be any of the Sigmex
6100 or 6200 range. 
.P 0
It is possible to log in on the Sigmex, but a second terminal is often
used, in order to avoid having alphanumerics and graphics on the same
screen as this can lead to severe cluttering of the screen with
information.

.P 0;The connection to the computer may be by serial or
parallel link. For serial operation, the display is accessed on logical
name LSL$TK, which must be set up to the terminal line. If this is not the
user's login terminal, then the line's protection must be set to allow access
to it. Parallel mode will be used automatically if logical name WKSPLL is
assigned to a valid parallel interface device (this will probably be something
like XAA0: on a MicroVAX or IDA0: on a VAX). At most customer sites
LSL$TK is defined in the LITES2 initialisation file LSL$COM:LITES2INI.COM. 
Access to the LITES2 interactive editor is recommended for
efficient use of the DTMCREATE package. If LITES2 is not used at your site
then logical name LSL$TK should be defined in the DTMCREATE package
initialisation file LSL$COM:DTMCREATEINI.COM. A suitable DCL statement
to do this is:
.P 0;_$_ DEFINE_ LSL$TK 'F$LOGICAL("TT")
.P 0;This assumes that the Sigmex display is the login device. If a separate
terminal is used as the login device then logical name LSL$TK should be
assigned to the Sigmex display line, not the login terminal line. 

.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Interactive devices\*
In addition to the login keyboard, DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT is capable
of interpreting commands from a digitising table on a separate terminal
line, and a Sigmex bitpad. 

.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Digitising table\*

.P 0;The digitising table input is interpreted by DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT
using the Table Monitor system.
.P 0
To use the Table Monitor, a table monitor process must be started, using
program STARTMON. If the 'named monitor' option is used, then logical
name LSL$MONITOR__TABLE must point to the serial line. In addition, if
the table is anything other than a standard ALTEK, then logical table
LSL$TABMON__ROUTINE (or LSL$TABMON__ROUTINE___<terminal_> for named
monitor) must point to a suitable decoding shareable image. This logical
name must be available to the table monitor process, and so should be in
the group or system logical name table. 


.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Bitpad\*
If a Sigmex bitpad is available, then the TRIEDIT command ENABLE BITPAD may be
used. When the bitpad is is use, a small white cursor cross will appear, and
may be moved around by moving the bitpad puck. 

.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*GIN Buttons\*
.P 0;The DTMCREATE Reference Manual assumes by default that the user
is logged onto a VAXstation. It is assumed that when running module TRIEDIT, GIN
(Graphics INteraction) is via the VAXstation mouse or bitpad. The DTMCREATE
Reference Manual refers to GIN button presses in terms of "left", "middle"
and "right" buttons, for "point', "master point" and "end" respectively.
On an ALTEK digitising puck or a SIGMEX bitpad puck, the equivalent buttons
are 1, 2 and 3. 

.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Keyboard\*
If the Sigmex is used as the login terminal keyboard input
is taken from the Sigmex keyboard. If a separate VT100 (or equivalent)
terminal is used as the login terminal, keyboard input is expected from that
keyboard.


.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*General hints\*
If there appears to be no response from the Sigmex, then first try
pressing carriage return, or CTRL/C. If it is impossible to obtain a
response, then Shift/f15 on the Sigmex keyboard will reset the display.
If this is done during editing, it will not be possible to redraw the
maps, but the data in the input files will not be affected. You may still
EXIT normally. If the Sigmex hangs while using it as the login terminal,
it will be necessary to terminate the DTMCREATE module by CTRL/Y after a
reset.
.P 0
The f1 light on the Sigmex keyboard should not be illuminated. It is
turned on/off by Shift/f1, and if on, indicates diagnostic mode which
drastically slows down operation.

.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Sigmex setup\*
The following parameters should be set on the Sigmex setup menu (and
permanently saved using Shift/S).

.HL 1 ^^^*DTMCREATE graphics lookup file setup\*

.P 0;DTMCREATE module graphics options are controlled by three lookup files
which are accessed via logical name LSL$LOOKUP: The files are CONFIGURE.DAT,
CONFIGDEF.DAT and TERMTYPE.DAT. For details of the purpose and content
of these files see Appendix A to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual.

.P 0;The lookup file TERMTYPE.DAT contains the graphics device definition
for each terminal line and is referenced by DTMCREATE modules TRIANG, TRIDER 
and TRIGRID. A typical entry for a terminal line which is to use a 
Sigmex 6100/6200 series terminal is:

.P 0;TXA1:	S6100

.P 0;DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT uses a lookup file, LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGDEF.DAT, to
select and initialise the default hardware configuration for your particular
terminal line at your site. Alternatively you may specify on the startup
command line the hardware options that you wish to use, or select hardware
options (but not graphic screen type) while you are running the program by
using the ENABLE command. If you choose to select your own hardware options
TRIEDIT checks in another site dependent lookup file,
LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGURE.DAT, that the desired options are available (and are in a
valid combination) and then initialises the devices accordingly. 

.P 0;Valid entries in either of the TRIEDIT graphics lookup files, for a
terminal line which is to use a Sigmex 6100/6200 series terminal are: 

.P 0;TXA1:	S6100 BITPAD 
.P 0;TXA1:	S6100 BITPAD VT100
.P 0;TXA1:	S6100 TABLE
.P 0;TXA1:	S6100 TABLE VT100
.P 0;TXA1:	NOGRAPHICS

.P 0;Note that BITPAD and TABLE are mutually exclusive, no other GIN
(Graphics INteraction) options are allowed e.g. JOYSTICK or THUMBWHEELS.
