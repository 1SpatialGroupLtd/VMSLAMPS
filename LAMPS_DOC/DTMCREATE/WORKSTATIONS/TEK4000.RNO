.HL 1 ^^^*Introduction\*
This document describes the workstation dependent facilities available
when operating DTMCREATE on Tektronix 4010/4014 series displays. It is
to be read as a supplement to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual and in
particular Appendix A of that manual. 

.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Display\*
A single graphics display is supported, this either a Tektronix
4010 or 4014 display.
.P 0
It is possible to login on the Tektronix, but a second terminal is often
used, in order to avoid having alphanumerics and graphics on the same
screen as this can lead to severe cluttering of the screen with
information.

.P 0;The display is accessed via logical name LSL$TK, which must be set up to
the terminal line. If this is not the user's login terminal, then the line's
protection must be set to allow access to it. At most customer sites LSL$TK is
defined in the LITES2 initialisation file LSL$COM:LITES2INI.COM. Access to the
LITES2 interactive editor is recommended for efficient use of the DTMCREATE
package. If LITES2 is not used at your site then logical name LSL$TK should be
defined in the DTMCREATE package initialisation file LSL$COM:DTMCREATEINI.COM.
A suitable DCL statement to do this is: 

.P 0;_$_ DEFINE_ LSL$TK 'F$LOGICAL("TT")

.P 0;This assumes that the Tektronix display is the login device. If a separate
terminal is used as the login device, then logical name LSL$TK should be
assigned to the Tektronix display line, not the login terminal line. 

.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*Interactive devices\*
In addition to the login keyboard, DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT is capable
of interpreting commands from a digitising table on a separate terminal
line, or Tektronix thumbwheels.
.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Digitising table\*

.P 0;The digitising table input is interpreted by DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT
using the Table Monitor system.
.P 0
To use the Table Monitor, a table monitor process must be started, using
program STARTMON. If the 'named monitor' option is used, then logical
name LSL$MONITOR__TABLE must point to the serial line. In addition, if
the table is anything other than a standard ALTEK, then logical table
LSL$TABMON__ROUTINE (or LSL$TABMON__ROUTINE___<terminal_> for named
monitor) must point to a suitable decoding shareable image. This logical
name must be available to the table monitor process, and so should be in
the group or system logical name table. 


.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Thumbwheels\*
Tektronix 4010 and 4014 terminals are equipped with thumbwheels for graphical
interaction. When the thumbwheels are used, a cursor cross
will appear, and may be moved around by moving the thumbwheels. 

.TP 8
.HL 2^^^*GIN Buttons\*
.P 0;The DTMCREATE Reference Manual assumes by default that the user
is logged onto a VAXstation. It is assumed that when running module TRIEDIT, GIN
(Graphics INteraction) is via the VAXstation mouse or bitpad. The DTMCREATE
Reference Manual refers to GIN button presses in terms of "left", "middle"
and "right" buttons, for "point", "master point" and "end" respectively.
On an ALTEK digitising puck the equivalent buttons are 1, 2 and 3. 
If the Tektronix thumbwheels are used for graphical interaction,
then keyboard button presses are used to specify commands; press "P" for
"point", "M" for "master point" and "E" for "end". The letters may be either 
upper or lower case.

.TP 8
.HL 2 ^^^*Keyboard\*
.P 0;If the Tektronix is used as the login terminal keyboard input
is taken from the Tektronix keyboard. If a separate VT100 (or equivalent)
terminal is used as the login terminal, keyboard input is expected from that
keyboard.


.TP 8
.HL 1 ^^^*DTMCREATE graphics lookup file setup\*

.P 0;DTMCREATE module graphics options are controlled by three lookup files
which are accessed via logical name LSL$LOOKUP: The files are CONFIGURE.DAT,
CONFIGDEF.DAT and TERMTYPE.DAT. For details of the purpose and content
of these files see Appendix A to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual.

.P 0;The lookup file TERMTYPE.DAT contains the graphics device definition
for each terminal line and is referenced by DTMCREATE modules TRIANG, TRIDER 
and TRIGRID. Typical entries for terminal lines which are to use a 
Tektronix 4010/4014 series terminals are:

.P 0;TXA1:	T4010
.BR;TXA2:	T4014


.P 0;DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT uses a lookup file, LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGDEF.DAT, to
select and initialise the default hardware configuration for your particular
terminal line at your site. Alternatively you may specify on the startup
command line the hardware options that you wish to use, or select hardware
options (but not graphic screen type) while you are running the program by
using the ENABLE command. If you choose to select your own hardware options
TRIEDIT checks in another site dependent lookup file,
LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGURE.DAT, that the desired options are available (and are in a
valid combination) and then initialises the devices accordingly. 


.P 0;Valid entries in either of the TRIEDIT graphics lookup files, for a
terminal line which is to use a Tektronix 4010/4014 series display are: 


.P 0;TXA1:	T4010 THUMBWHEELS
.P 0;TXA1:	T4010 THUMBWHEELS VT100
.P 0;TXA1:	T4010 TABLE
.P 0;TXA1:	T4010 TABLE VT100
.P 0;TXA1:	NOGRAPHICS

.P 0;Note that THUMBWHEELS and TABLE are mutually exclusive, no other GIN
(Graphics INteraction) options are allowed e.g. TRACKERBALL or THUMBWHEELS.
