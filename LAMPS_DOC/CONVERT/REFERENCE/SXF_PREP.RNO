.HL 2 ^^^*Comparison of SXF and IFF\*

.P 0
IFF is a feature oriented data format - data is separated into features, and 
each feature represents one 'thing' on the map. An integer feature code is used
to say what type of thing it is that the feature represents. A feature might
thus be a contour, or a house, or a river, depending on the type of map
being digitised, and the way that the data is to be used.

.P 0
In contrast, SXF has no concept of a 'feature', ...
.!** what are the basic elements in SXF ?

.HL 2 ^^^*Preparation for digitising data to be output to SXF\*

.P 0
The customer should supply a list of how the various forms of data on the
map(s) are to be output. This should describe for each type of data
what line weight, style and colour should be used, what
text fonts and sizes are required, what symbols (cells) are to be used, and
how to digitise them, and so on. 

.P 0
For digitising within IFF, feature codes must be assigned to all of these
data-types, and an FRT file (together with SRI and TRI files) created.

.P 0
Care should be taken in considering what graphical type the  IFF features 
should have - see the section 'Comparison of SXD and FRT files' below.

.P 0
In some cases, there may not be an obvious linkage between the way the
data-type is specified in the customer specification, and the way it would 
most naturally be digitised. Sometimes it may be necessary to 
use a small program to post-process the data before outputting to 
SXF. The small program would be written purely for a particular application,
in order to make the digitising and editing operations easier.

.P 0
Since customer requirements for SXF are likely to vary by quite a lot, care
must be taken in designing the flowline for producing the data to be output
to SXF, and small programs to process the data before output may often be
required.

.HL 2 ^^^*Offsetting data\*

.P 0
Within the IFF file, coordinates are stored relative to the bottom left hand
corner of the sheet, the local origin. This allows more accuracy within the IFF
file. In modern IFF files, the coordinates of that local origin are then stored
in the map descriptor (MD) entry, and the absolute coordinates of a feature can
be obtained by adding the value stored in the IFF file to the value taken
from the map descriptor.

.P 0
The default action of I2SXF is to ....
.!** can absolute coordinates be output ?
.!** what about Z ?

.HL 2 ^^^*Digitising texts - composite text features\*

.P 0
I2SXF will output composite text features (text features which contain
more than one text component). It outputs such text components as if they
were separate text features, using the feature code and descriptive data
in the TS entry for each component, instead of the data in the FS entry
for the feature as a whole.

The SXD table in the parameter file tells I2SXF what each feature code in the 
IFF file means in terms of SXF data.

.HL 3 ^^^*Feature code definitions\*

.P 0   
The SXD table contains one line for each feature code used in the IFF file, and 
these are composed as follows:

.P 5
^*fc###trf\*

.P 0
where:

.LM +13
.P -8
^*fc\*######is the feature code
.I -8
^*trf\*#####is the corresponding SXF transfer code
.LM -13

.HL 3 ^^^*Comments\*

.P 0
Comment lines are indicated by a '!' character - any line starting with this 
is ignored. Also, any data on the end of a line is 
currently ignored, although it is still good practice to start a comment
at the end of the line with a comment character.
