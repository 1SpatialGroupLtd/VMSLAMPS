.HL 2 ^^^*The Digital Chart of the World Format\*

.P 0
The DCW is a general-purpose database containing digital map data covering the
world and divided into thematic layers.

.P 0
The DCW uses a georelational model called Vector Product Format (VPF) to
support a vector-based, thematically layered database. The VPF is described in
the document MIL-STD-600006.

.P 0
The DCW is available on four separate CD-ROMs, each containing a region of
the world at 1:1,000,000 scale called a library. Each CD-ROM also contains a
BROWSE library which is an overview of the globe at 1:31,000,000 scale.

.P 0
As the DCW database tables are binary in format, the data cannot be shown
except as schematic tables denoting the rows and columns.

.P 0
Any errors or faults present in the DCW data cannot be corrected due to fact
that the data is read-only from CD-ROMs and the donor of the data should be
contacted. However, it is possible to copy the required DCW files onto a 
writable media providing the directory hierarchy and contents remains the same
and edit the files using PATCH/ABSOLUTE. This is only recommended for users
who have a thorough knowledge of DCW database tables. PATCH/ABSOLUTE can only
be used to overwrite data, not insert it which means editing the files will be
of limited use.

.P 0
All recipients of the DCW data should receive an accompanying manual called the
DCW Product Specification (document MIL-D-89009) which describes, in detail,
the format of all database tables.

.P 0
This section will therefore only provide an overview of the structure of the
database and how the tables relate to each other.

.P 0
The highest level of hierarchy which exist within DCW is the database, below
which exist the 5 libraries:

.BR;^*NOAMER\*#####Northern America
.BR;^*SASAUS\*#####Southern Asia and Australia
.BR;^*SOAMAFR\*####Southern America and Africa
.LM -4
.P 0
Each library exists on its own CD-ROM except BROWSE which is duplicated on
each of the others.

.P 0
Within each library, there are a number of coverages which are analogous to
IFF layers. There are 8 thematic layers in the BROWSE library and 17 in the
others, each having a unique mnemonic. These are as follows:

.P 0
At the coverage level, features are grouped into classes of areas, lines,
points and text. Each class is held as a Feature Table which contains all
the features for the coverage over the whole extent of the library and can
typically be very large.

.P 0
The Feature Tables will be of the form ccAREA.AFT for areas, ccLINE.LFT for
lines, ccPOINTS.PFT for points and ccTEXT.TFT for text where 'cc' is the
coverage mnemonic. (eg DNLINE.LFT for the Drainage Line Feature Table).

.P 0
Each coverage contains a Feature Class Schema (FCS) table which contains the
primary and foreign key relationships between the various DCW tables.

.P 0
The coverages overlay a tiling system which divides the globe up into a grid
of tiles called GEOREFs which are themselves split into sub-tiles (henceforth
simply called tiles). Refer to the GEOREF Tiling System below.

.P 0
Each tile has a Primitive Table corresponding to a feature class which is
cross-referenced with their respective Feature Tables using the foreign keys
defined in the FCS table. The Feature Tables hold information at the feature
level such as feature-coding and attributes while the Primitive Tables hold 
the geometry. If a particular Primitive Table is missing from a tile, then
no features of that class are present in that area.
.TP 8
.P 0
The Area Feature Table references the face (FAC), ring (RNG) and edge (EDG)
Primitive Tables.
.P 0
The Line Feature Table references the edge (EDG) Primitive Table.
.P 0
The Point Feature Table references the node (END) Primitive Table.
.P 0
The Text Feature Table references the text (TXT) Primitive Table.

^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL 3 ^^^*The GEOREF Tiling System\*
.P 0
The GEOREF system is a naming convention for each 15 degree square in a grid
covering the world. Each 15 degree tile is identified by two letters; the first
represents the latitude and the second represents the longitude. The valid
longitude letters are A to Z (excluding I and O) and valid latitude letters
are A to M (excluding I). Examples of invalid GEOREFs are II, AN and OC.
.P 0
Each GEOREF on a DCW CD-ROM is divided into nine 5 degree square sub-tiles
referenced in a 3 by 3 grid from 1,1 to 3,3 where the first number is in the
x direction and the second is in the y direction.
.P 0
The south-west corner of GEOREF AA11 is at (-180.0,-90.0) and for GEOREF ZM33
it is at (175.0,85.0) with NG11 at (0.0,0.0).
.P 0
A figure of the GEOREF tiling system is presented in the DCW Product
Specification which should be used as a reference when extracting files.
.P 0
It should be noted that the GEOREF Tiling System underlies each library
except the BROWSE library which has Primitive Tables covering the whole
globe.

^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL 3 ^^^*The DCW Directory Structure\*
.P 0
Not all of the database tables present on the CD-ROMs are needed by the
conversion software as some are intended for GIS applications, such as
Thematic Index, Spatial Index and Bounding Rectangle tables. Variable-length
index files are required to find the starting position of variable length text
or coordinate records within certain tables.

To explain the hierarchy of the database file on the CD-ROMs, an example
is given below of all the files (and their directories) required for a
particular tile.
.P 0
Consider a single tile POWF33 which lies in the SASAUS library. If all of the
classes are required for this tile, then the following database tables will
be needed. Note the hierarchy of the directory structure.
