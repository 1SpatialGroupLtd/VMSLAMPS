.HL 2 ^^^*DESCRIPTION\*

.LM +10
.P0;I2MGD is a utility to transfer an Internal Feature Format (IFF) disk 
file to a 'map sheet' on an MGD77 format magnetic tape.
A 'map sheet' is a single file or dataset on the output tape. 
The program allows the creation of multiple datasets on one tape but does
not currently support datasets spanning more than one tape. Very large files
should be divided into smaller files with identical 'header' features in
layer 0, and then transferred to separate tapes.


.P0;Note that only a single map sheet may be transferred during a single run 
of the program.


.P0;If the /DIAGNOSTICS qualifier is used on the command line, the program 
produces messages giving information about the blocks being written to
the tape, and any errors or difficulties which may be encountered.

.P0;I2MGD transfers information from a dummy feature in layer 0 of the 
input IFF file to the header block or blocks of an MGD77 format tape.
The dumy feature is taken to be the first feature with the required feature
code (FC)(default is 10) read from layer 0.
 Header
information is held in the IFF file in a number of AC entries with codes
 as defined by the FRT 
file read by the program. The dummy header feature has the coordinates 
of the local origin of the IFF file and these are ignored by I2MGD.

.P0;I2MGD translates each IFF feature record, with the specified FC,
in the input file into a MGD77 logical data record . The data features can
be contained in any layers from layer 1 onwards of the IFF file and are ordered 
as in the IFF file. The X, Y and Z coordinates of a ZS entry are transfered 
to the longitude, latitude and corrected depth, respectively, of a data 
record. If the Z coordinate is an IFF undefined value, it is translated into
a null depth value of 99999. All the AC entries contained in the feature are
transfered to the relevant attribute fields in the data record. The codes of
these AC entries are determined from the FRT file read by the program.

.P0;Some quantities, for example longitudes, may be subject to rounding errors 
in their final digit when the program transfers them from the input IFF file
 to the MGD77 format tape file. This will generally only occur for 
quantities such as longitude when all 8 of their potential significant figures 
(digits) are used (ie. greater than 99.99999 degrees). This rounding error
is inherent to VAX/VMS data storage methods. It may cause a positional
inaccuracy of less than 1 metre on the earth's surface.

.P0;The I2MGD program always refers to the types of the AC entries which it 
constructs using the same AC names. The user may alter the codes of the AC 
entries written to the output IFF file by changing the FRT file read by the 
program. The use of the FRT file is described in the 'Data Preparation' 
section of the documentation for this module. 

.P0;Details of the structure, content and characteristics of an MGD77 
format tape are to be found in the 'Data Format' section of this modules's 
documentation.

.P0;It is essential that the tape is mounted as a foreign volume with a
write-permit-ring prior to 
running I2MGD. This is achieved using the DCL command MOUNT with the /FOREIGN 
qualifier e.g.
.BR;$#MOUNT MSA0:/FOREIGN.
