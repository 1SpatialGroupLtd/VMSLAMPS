The Military Survey Data Structure (MSDS) exchange format is a UK
interim format for the exchange of topologically structured vector
digital data. It will be replaced when  the NATO Digital Geographic
Information Working Group (DGIWG) standards  are complete.

.P 0
The MSDS format expected is an ASCII text format, as described to
Laser-Scan in the document "MIL SVY DATA STRUCTURE (MSDS) EXCHANGE
FORMAT".

The IFF files produced are intended for processing directly to produce
graphic output. For more information on the IFF file structure see the
^*IFF User's Guide\* of the Laser-Scan MAPPING package documentation.

MSDS data comes in an ASCII file. This will usually be a ANSI file on
magnetic tape. The record length is variable, with a maximum length of
4096 bytes. Each input MSDS  file will be output to one IFF file.

MSDS consists of topologically structured data gathered into "THEMES" or
layers. The data within a THEME is divided into two levels, the feature
level and the spatial level. The feature level combines the resulting
spatial entities with attribute data to represent a real world
geographic entity.

.P 0
There are three spatial entities, which each relate directly to a
feature type. These are:
.LIST
.LE;Node - a zero-dimensional entity, representing a single significant
coordinate. Nodes are related directly to Point features.
.LE;EDGE - a one-dimensional entity representing a set of coordinates.
Line features consist of one or more connected edges. Edges also bound
the third spatial entity:
.LE;FACE - a two-dimensional entity representing the largest connected
area, enclosed by oriented edges. Area features consist of one or more
faces that share a common boundary.
.END LIST

The simple features (points, lines and areas) can be combined, with
further attribute data to form complex features.

.P 0
The coordinates in MSDS are stored as integer coordinates, usually as
centimetres on the projection. X,Y and Z values are stored for each
point.

.HL 2 ^^^*Comparison of MSDS and IFF\*

.P 0
IFF is a feature oriented data format - data is separated into features,
and  each feature represents one 'thing' on the map. An integer feature
code is used to say what type of thing it is that the feature
represents. A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or a river,
depending on the type of map being digitised, and the way that the data
is to be used.

.P 0
MSDS format shares this concept of a 'feature', at the simple feature
level. Each simple feature has a name that can be related to an IFF
feature code. This translation is effected by a simple lookup table that
relates the MSDS feature names with IFF feature codes. Complex features
can be defined in MSDS in terms of simple features, but are ignored in
the conversion to IFF.

.P 0
MSDS has several concepts which have no direct equivalence in
unstructured feature-based IFF files. The MSDS2I program is intended for
producing IFF files for graphic display and hardcopy output, and hence
does not attempt to preserve such MSDS properties as shared geometry or
complex features. It would be  possible to convert the concept of THEMEs
into LAYERs in IFF, but at the moment all features are simply written to
layer 1 in the IFF file.
