.HL 2 ^^^*DESCRIPTION\*

.LM +10
.P0;I2DLG is a utility to transfer an Internal Feature Format (IFF) disk 
file to a 'dataset' in Standard DLG format on magnetic tape or disc. A
'dataset' is a single file on the output tape comprising a series of header
records and data records of nodes,areas, and lines.  The program allows the
creation of multiple sets of data records after one set of header records on
one tape but does not currently support datasets spanning more than one tape.
Very large files should be divided into smaller files with identical 'header'
features in layer 0, and then transferred to separate tapes.

.P0;Note that only a single map sheet may be transferred during a single run 
of the program.

.P0;If the /LOG qualifier is used on the command line, the program 
produces messages giving information about the progress of the program, and any
errors or difficulties which may be encountered.

.P0;I2DLG transfers ancillary information from a dummy feature in layer 0 of
the input IFF file to the header block or blocks of an DLG format tape. Header
information is held in the IFF file in a number of AC entries with codes as
defined by the FRT  file read by the program. The other details of the dummy 
header feature are ignored by I2DLG.

.P 0;I2DLG initially scans the whole IFF file to determine the total number of
nodes, areas and lines (on a per category basis if /BY__LAYER qualifier is
given) and counts point features with FCs given with the /POINT qualifier as a
node and a line. Category codes are derived from the first AC entry ( after
layer 0) with a
valid code defined as a category in the ACD tables of the specified FRT file.
If the default situation of /NOBY__LAYER applies then all subsequent AC codes
must be in the same category ( ie have identical first 4 characters in their
ACD names). Where the /BY__LAYER qualifier has been given then the AC codes
must be consistent within each layer.

.P 0;The IFF file is then searched for all the Junction Block (JB) entries and 
a node is counted for each junction that is not already represented by a node
feature.

.P 0;I2DLG then reads all the AC entries in layer 0 of the IFF file and
extracts the relevant entries (as defined in the ACD table of the specified FRT file
), to generate the DLG header records. To complete the header the scale, corner
points and map projection parameters are extracted from the Map Descriptor (MD)
and Corner Point (CP) IFF entries. The header records are then written to the
DLG file.

.P 0;The IFF file is then searched for the nodes, areas and lines, previously
identified in the initial scan, which are then written as 3 groups of data
records together with their attribute information and coordinates. Also output,
for the lines, are the cross-references to the start and end nodes and adjacent
areas which constitute the structural information.
.BR;This will be repeated for each layer if the /BY__LAYER qualifier has been
given.


.P0;Details of the structure, content and characteristics of an DLG
format tape are to be found in the 'Data Format' section of this modules's 
documentation.

.P0;It is essential that the tape is mounted as a foreign volume with a
write-permit-ring prior to  running I2DLG. This is achieved using the DCL
command MOUNT with the /FOREIGN  qualifier e.g.
.BR;$#MOUNT MSA0:/FOREIGN.
