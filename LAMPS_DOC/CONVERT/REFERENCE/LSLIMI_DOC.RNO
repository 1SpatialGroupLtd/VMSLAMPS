.br;^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 1 ^^^*Introduction\*

.lm +10

.p0; The LSLIMI translation menu allows the user to read data from
magnetic tape or disk file into Informap, and to write from Informap to
tape or file, the following formats:

.list "o"

.le; OSTF - the OS transfer format, sometimes also called DMC

.le; NTF# - the UK National Transfer Format for spatially referenced data.
Currently, level 1 is supported, and level 2 is partially supported, as
specified in the current version of the standard - between versions 1.0 and
1.1. 

.end list 0

.p0; The menu system allows the user to specify what is to be read or written,
and then runs the appropriate programs.

.hl 1 ^^^*The environment assumed\*

.lm +10

.p0; LSLIMI is intended for a system running Informap. It does not require
a Laser-Scan LAMPS environment, and if one is present, it is used independently
of that environment.

.p0; The only parts of LAMPS that are relevant are the following modules
from the CONVERT package:

.list 0,"o"
.le; the LSLIMI# module - LSLIMI__MENU.COM, LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM, 
an optional menu initialisation command file, and various parameter files
.le; the IFFIMAP module - I2IMAP.EXE and IMAP2I.EXE
.le; the IFFOSTF module - I2OSTF.EXE, OSTF2I.EXE and OSTFINDEX.EXE
.le; the IFFNTF# module - I2NTF.EXE and NTF2I.EXE
.end list 0

.hl 1 ^^^*Where things are\*

.lm +10

.p0; The directories used by LSLIMI are all to be found in STI__ROOT:[LSL].
The following directories are used:

.list "o"

.le; STI__ROOT:[LSL.COM]
.br; This directory contains the command files LSLIMI__MENU.COM,
LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM and an optional menu initialisation file. LSLIMI__MENU.COM
is the menu system itself, and LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM sets up the environment
required by the menu system. The optional menu initialisation command file
allows users to tailor the menus for a particular job. LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM
defines the logical name LSL$COM to point to this directory. 

.le; STI__ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP]
.br; This directory contains the translation parameter files used by the
menu system. LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM defines the logical name LSL$LOOKUP to point 
to this directory.

.le; STI__ROOT:[LSL.DATA]
.br; This is the directory in which OSTF and NTF files are read or written,
when transfer is not to or from magnetic tape. If files are to be read by
the system, they must be in this directory, with extension .OSTF or .NTF
respectively. LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM defines the logical name LSL$DATA to point to 
this directory.

.le; STI__ROOT:[LSL.TEMP]
.br; This is the working directory for the menu system. Temporary files are
created here, and then deleted again. LSLIMI__MENU defines the logical name
LSL$IF to point to this directory. If LSL$IF previously pointed elsewhere,
it will reset it when it exits.

.le; STI__ROOT:[LSL.EXE]
.br; This directory contains the images (.EXE files) of the translation
programs used by the menu system. LSLIMI__LSLINI.COM defines the logical name 
LSL$EXE to point to this directory.

.hl 1 ^^^*Using the menus\*

.lm +10

.p0; In general, the menus are self-explanatory. However, it is worth
explaining some things about their use.

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Special characters\*

.p0; There are three special characters when using the menu system. These are
_<CTRL/Z_>, _<CTRL/Y_> and "?".

.list "o"

.le; _<CTRL/Z_> is used to move back a level. It is only meaningful in response
to a prompt. If used in response to the

.p10;Choose the option you want_:

.p0; prompt, it will cause a return to the current menu's parent menu, or (in
the case of the TOP-LEVEL menu) exit the menu system. At the bottom of each
menu display there is always a line specifying the action of _<CTRL/Z_> when
used in this manner.

.p0; If used in response to other prompts, _<CTRL/Z_> is treated as a reply of
_<CR_>.

.le; _<CTRL/C_> is used to interrupt the current operation. If used within
a menu, it will cause a return to the TOP-LEVEL menu. If used during input
or output, it will terminate the transfer. A line is always displayed
specifying the action of _<CTRL/C_>.

.le; ? may be used in response to the

.p10;Choose the option you want_:

.p0; prompt to cause the current menu to be redisplayed. It has no other use.

.end list 0

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Choosing an option\*

.p0; Each menu provides a list of options that may be selected. The user can
select an option by typing the option name in response to the "Choose the
option you want" prompt. For instance in the NTF main menu,
the options are:

.blank
.literal
	IN    - read NTF data into Informap
	OUT   - write Informap data to NTF
.end literal

.p0; so the user could respond with either IN or OUT. The menu does not
distinguish the case of the answer, so upper and lower cases may be freely
mixed. Also, options may always be abbreviated to their first two characters
without fear of ambiguity.

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Choosing a value for an option\*

.p0; When deciding what to input or output, the user is presented with a 
display of the options relevant to the operation. For each option, where
applicable, the current and default values are shown. For instance, figure 4
shows the initial OSTF input/output menu for OUTPUT. The value associated with
an option can be changed in two ways:

.list

.le; The user can select an option by name:

.lm +10
.p0;Choose the option you want_: ^*DENSITY_<CR_>\*
.br;Density to write output tapes at_:
.lm -10

.p0; The user can then either reply with _<CR_> to accept the default
value, or can specify the value required.

.le; Alternatively, the user can specify the new value for an option
immediately:

.lm +10
.p0;Choose the option you want_: ^*DENSITY 800_<CR_>\*
.lm -10

.end list 0

.p0; In either case, if the value specified is acceptable, the menu will be
drawn again with the appropriate value inserted. If the value is not
acceptable, the user will be prompted for a correct value, as in case (1).

.p0; It should be noted that all values (with the exception of the Informap
drawings selected for output) are global to the menu system - that is, once
they have been selected, they are selected for all menus in which they are
applicable. For instance, if the WHAT option is set to file input or output,
then it will be so set in all of the input/output menus.

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Selecting OSTF sheets for input\*

.p0; When inputting data from OSTF, it is possible to select which sheets
from the input dataset are required.

.p0; If the OSTF data possesses a sheet index at its start, this may be
inspected with the OSTF input menu SHOW option. The SELECT option may then
be used to specify a list of the sheets required, by their number in the
dataset. This selection list is in the normal DEC VMS format. For instance,

.p10; 1:3,5,7

.p0; selects the first, second, third, fifth and seventh sheets from the
tape or file.

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Specifying drawings to be output\*

.p0; When outputting data from Informap, the drawings to be output must be
specified. This is done using the DRAWING option in the appropriate menu.
More than one drawing may be selected:

.list

.le; The user can be prompted for the drawings required - the list is ended
with a reply of _<CR_>:

.lm +10
.p0;Choose the option you want_: ^*DRAWING_<CR_>\*
.br;First drawing to output_: ^*SV1234NE_<CR_>\*
.br;Drawing 1 is SV1234NE
.br;#Next drawing to output_: ^*SV1234SE_<CR_>\*
.br;Drawing 2 is SV1234SE
.br;#Next drawing to output_: ^*_<CR_>\*
.lm -10

.le; Alternatively, drawings may be added to the list one at a time:

.lm +10
.p0;Choose the option you want_: ^*DRAWING SV1234NW_<CR_>\*
.br;Drawing 3 is SV1234NW
.lm -10

.le; The two methods may be intermingled - drawings will be added to the list
until the menu is exited with _<CTRL/Z_> or _<CTRL/C_>

.end list 0

.p0; The number of drawings currently selected is displayed in the menu
display. To see the names of the drawings selected, use the SHOW option.

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*The "Press _<RETURN_> to continue" prompt\*

.p0; The highlighted prompt

.p10; Press _<RETURN_> to continue:

.p0; is used for two purposes:

.list

.le; To ensure that the user has a chance to see the contents of the screen,
before it is replaced by a menu. The three common example are when the SHOW
option is used (to allow the user to see the result), after an input or output
operation has completed (for the same reason), or after an error has
occurred (to allow the user to see the error messages).

.le; To allow the user to complete some operation before allowing the menu
system to continue. The main example of this is when the user is requested
to mount a magnetic tape - the process pauses to allow this to be done.

.end list 0

.lm -10

.tp 10
.br;^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 1 ^^^*Locking of the temporary directory\*

.lm +10

.p0; Since all input and output translations use the temporary directory
STI__ROOT:[LSL.TEMP] as workspace, only one LSLIMI menu may perform
translation at any one time. To enforce this restriction, the menu locks
the directory before translation starts, and only unlocks it when it has
deleted its working files from there.

.p0; The locking is accomplished by creating a text file called
DIRECTORY__IS__IN__USE.ALREADY in the temporary directory. If such a file
exists, the menu will not proceed, but instead prints out the contents of the
file - this states who is using the directory and for what purpose - and
returns to the input/output menu.

.lm -10

.tp 10
.br;^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 1 ^^^*Technical matters\*

.lm +10

.p0; This section is intended for people who may have to amend or maintain
the LSLIMI system. The two things that might require altering are the
default values used by the system (for the input/output menus) and whether
an initialisation file is read. If any changes are made, they should be
recorded in the Modifications section at the start of the file. This will
allow them to be reproduced in new releases of the menu command file.

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Default values\*

.p0; The default values used for the input/output menus are all defined as
local symbols at the start of LSLIMI__MENU.COM, in the section flagged

.lm +10
.literal
$! ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
$! INITIALISATION OF DEFAULTS
.end literal
.lm -10

.p0; Each symbol is of the form IMAP$d__xxx where 'xxx' describes the purpose
of the symbol. It is expected that each site may need to change some of the
default values to match their own environment - in particular, the following
values:

.list 0,"o"

.le; IMAP$d__drive# - the name of the default tape drive
.le; IMAP$d__schema - the name of the default Informap schema
.le; IMAP$i__params - the name of the translation parameter files. Note that
this is an ^&initial\& value, not a default - the default parameter file name
is always the same as the schema name. This value allows that assumption to be
changed.
.le; IMAP$d__ntf__donor - the name of the site, to be used as the _{DONOR_}
for NTF output.

.end list 0

.tp 10
.p0;^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.hl 2 ^^^*Menu initialisation file\*

.p0; If the logical name LSL$IMENU__INITIALISE is defined, then LSLIMI
assumes that it points to a command file which will pre-define some of the
option values used in the input/output menus. This is mainly useful for
debugging purposes, as normally the default values will be set correctly
for menu use. Documentation for the use of the initialisation file is to be
found within the CHECK__INIFILE subroutine in LSLIMI__MENU.COM, and an example 
(LSLIMI__MENU__INI.COM) is supplied with the LSLIMI module.
