.HL 2 ^^^*Introduction\*

.P 0
DMC and OSTF are the Ordnance Survey's standard customer transfer format.

.P 0
The original format was called DMC (for Digital Mapping Customer
format), and later revisions have been renamed OSTF (OS Transfer Format).

.P 0
The format is designed to be easily Fortran readable, with fixed size 8
character records. Different sections of the data are identified by negative
flags.

.P 0
Over the years OS have provided data to customers in several variants of the
form, and contractors have been required to supply data in similar variation.
The DMC and OSTF documentation has never specified any form of version number
or issue date to allow these forms to be distinguished. 

.P 0
This section attempts to present information gathered by Laser-Scan about
the variants. Some familiarity with the format is assumed.

.HL 2 ^^^*Versions_ of_ DMC/OSTF\*

.P 0
The original version of DMC is well defined, but later amendments have 
occurred (producing a format normally referred to as OSTF) in a non-structured 
manner. For simplicity's sake, the various forms identified by Laser-Scan have 
been numbered OSTF-0 and upwards. 

.P 0
The following forms can be identified:

.LIST "o"

.TP 6
.LE; OSTF-0 - old DMC
.P 0
this is the original customer format, and is what is generally meant by
DMC. It uses entries -1 to -13, -15, -17

.TP 6
.LE; OSTF-1 - middle DMC or early OSTF
.P 0
this was specified in Annex A of a draft document called ^*Beginner's guide to
plotting Ordnance Survey digital data\* at the beginning of 1983. The format was
referred to as both DMC and OSTF.

.P 0
The format is essentially the old DMC format with additional data entries - it
uses entries -1 to -15, -17 to -21. Note the changes in entry -10, etc. 

.TP 6
.LE; OSTF-2 - middle OSTF
.P 0
this was specified to contractors digitising for OS around 1984/85.

.P 0
The only variation from OSTF-1 is that the additional map header is slightly
longer. It is thus still a direct extension of old DMC. It also uses entries -1
to -15, -17 to -21 

.TP 6
.LE; OSTF-3 - late OSTF
.P 0      
this was specified to contractors after the above specification, and is current
from (at least) February 1985. At some time between September 1985 and 
February 1987, entries -19 and -22 appear to have been withdrawn.

.P 0
This format adds more data to the sheet header (which means that the previous
formats are not valid any more), and adds even more fields to the additional
map header. It uses entries -1 to -22, -44
 
.TP 6
.LE; OSTF-4 - current OSTF
.P 0
this was specified in November 1988.

.P 0
The only variations from OSTF-3 are changes to the secondary map header, the 
-20 entry. Some new fields have been added, while others have been rearranged.

.TP 6
.LE; OSTF+ - OSTF-3 and upwards with enhancements
.P 0      
this version provides enhancements to OSTF-3 and OSTF-4, and is only intended
for use within Ordnance Survey. It was specified in the "OSTF+ supplement to
'Digital Map Data - OSTF'" (2nd amendment), dated 27th February 1987. 

.P 0
This format is identical to OSTF-3 or OSTF-4, with additional entries -23, -24
and -25. The coordinate record has also been modified to include the method of
data capture for every point.

.LM +10

.P 0
Entries flagged with an asterisk before the entry number (_*) are either
not used in all versions of OSTF, or differ significantly in their contents.

.P 0
Note that entry -12 (rotation or alignment) may be absent in OSTF-0 for
features with an angle of zero.

.P 0
Note that the entries -16 (process code), -19 (left/right coding) and -22 (text
cross reference) are not always required, although presumably their inclusion
would not be regarded as illegal data.

.P 0
For a fuller description of the differences for entries, see the next section.

.TP 10
.P 0
^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL 2 ^^^*Data_ entries_ -_ analysis_ by_ version\*

.P 0
This section briefly describes each DMC/OSTF flag in turn, and states which
versions it is used in. It also describes any changes over the versions.

.LM +10

.P -10
cXXX#YYY	- coordinate record

.P 0
This contains the two coordinates (XXX and YYY respectively), offset within the
current grid square. Note that these are in the range 0-999, being thousandths
of a basic grid square. In OSTF-0 and OSTF-1, the 'c' character is always a
space. In OSTF-2 and OSTF-3, it may be a curve flag, and is set as: 

.LM +10
.P -5
" "##- (space) - ordinary coordinate
.I -5
"1"##- this coordinate is at the start of a curve
.I -5
"2"##- this coordinate is at the end of a curve.
.LM -10

.P 0
Note that curves are still fully interpolated (ie composed of straight line
segments). IFF data does not support the use of start/end curve flags, so
our programs will not output them.

.P 0
In OSTF+, the 'c' character denotes the capture method. When it is left 
blank, the value of the last capture method specified is assumed. Values for 
the capture method are the same as those listed for the -24 entry. The default 
is "0".

.P -10
##-1#sim	- map header

.P 0
This marks the start of a new sheet in the file. It is followed by:

.LM +5
.P0; Eastings
.BR; Northings
.BR; Basic grid size
.BR; Source scale
.LM -5

.P 0
and in OSTF-3 these are then followed by:

.LM +5
.P0; Job number
.BR; Digitising scale
.LM -5

.P 0
Note that the 'sim' flag is not used in OSTF-0.

.P -10
##-2###0	- end of sheet

.P 0
Followed immediately by either flag -3, or another sheet starting with flag
-1.

.P -10
##-3###0	- end of data, end of file

.P 0
The rest of the current block is padded with flag -6, to the actual end
of file.

.P -10
##-4#fsn	- start of feature

.P 0
This entry marks the start of a new feature - 'fsn' is the feature serial
number, in the range 0-9999.

.P -10
##-5###0	- end of feature

.P -10
##-6###0	- dummy - used to pad the end of data

.P -10
##-7##fc	- feature code - used for lines

.P -10
##-8##fc	- feature code - used for texts and symbols

.P -10
##-9###0	- new grid square

.P 0
The entry is:

.LM +5
.P0; ##-9###0
.BR; ##EE##NN
.LM -5

.P 0
where EE and NN are the numbers identifying the grid square containing the
coordinates following. This entry is output at the start of a feature, and
whenever a feature crosses from one grid square to another.

.P 0
EE and NN are normally in the range 0 to 9, but note that the coordinates
along the northern and eastern edges of the sheet are actually in grid squares
EE,10 and 10,NN - note that the coordinates in these cases are restricted
to the boundary itself.


.P -10
#-10#cat	- text description

.P 0
This entry is:

.LM +5
.P0; #-10#  #category
.BR; style  #height
.LM -5

.P 0
where 'category' is the OS text category, 'style' is the OS text style.

.P 0
The character height in 'height' is stored as a point size for OSTF-0 (with a
value between 1 and 24). For all other versions, the text height is stored as
tenths of a millimetre, corresponding to the appropriate point size of the
original text. 

.P -10
#-11#cnt	- text entry

.P 0
This entry is followed by 'cnt' characters of text, 8 per record.

.P -10
#-12#ang	- orientation

.BLANK
.LIST 0,"o"
.LE; For text features, the orientation gives the rotation of the text.
.LE; For symbols, it gives the angle of the symbol - this will only be relevant
for oriented and scaled symbols.
.LE; For lines, the angle is calculated from the first two points of the line,
and is used by OS when plotting the FSN next to the feature.
.END LIST 0

.P 0
In all cases, the angle is stored in tenths of a degree (0-3600), measured
anti-clockwise from the horizontal axis (ie in the standard direction).
Note that in OSTF-0 the orientation entry may be omitted if the angle is zero.

.P -10
#-13###0	- invisible line flag

.P 0
This indicates that the pen should be lifted when moving to the next coordinate
- there is an invisible line to the next point.

.P -10
#-14###0	- external grid square

.P 0
This entry is identical in form to the internal grid square entry, but is
used to code entries which are outside the sheet boundary - ie marginal
texts. Note that the grid squares with this entry may be negative.
This flag is not used in OSTF-0.

.P -10
#-15#dis	- distance - scaled symbol size

.P 0
'dis' is the size of a scaled symbol, in basic grid units.

.P -10
#-16##pc	- process code

.P 0
This contains the process code (as used in OS IFF files), and was introduced
in OSTF-1. This entry is not always required.

.P -10
#-17##ht	- contour height

.P 0
This contains a contour height, in metres.

.P -10
#-18#loc	- original text location

.P 0
This entry is:

.LM +5
.P0; #-18# location
.BR; ##EE# ##NN
.BR; #XXX# #YYY
.LM -5

.P 0
The 'location' is the location number at which the text was originally
digitised (0-8), and the coordinates following specify the original digitised
position.

.P 0
The normal coordinates passed for a text reflect its position when it is
at location 0 (ie text origin is bottom left hand corner). This entry allows
a program to know where and how the text was originally digitised.

.P 0
This entry is not used in OSTF-0.

.P -10
#-19###0	- left/right coding flag

.P 0
This indicates that a sequence of left and right boundaries will follow
- for instance:

.TP 10
.LM +5
.P0; ##-7##fc		1st boundary FC
.BR; #-19###0		boundary flag
.BR; #-11#cnt		text count - left side
.BR; ::::::::		the text
.BR; #-19###0		boundary flag
.BR; #-11#cnt		text count - right side
.BR; ::::::::		the text
.BR; ##-7##fc		2nd boundary FC
.BR; #--etc--
.LM -5

.P 0
This entry is not used in OSTF-0, and is not always required in the other
forms.

.P -10
#-20###0		- secondary map header

.P 0
This entry is followed by additional data for the map header. It is absent in
OSTF-0. It is followed by 20 records in OSTF-1, by 22 records in OSTF-2, and
by 54 records in OSTF-3 and OSTF-4. The OSTF-4 version differs from the OSTF-3
version; some fields have been renamed, replaced or discontinued, and new
ones have been introduced. Note that the OSTF-3 and OSTF-4 versions contain a
contractor identification code. This is assigned by OS and in OSTF-3 it is a 
number given to the supplier of the data; in OSTF-4 it consists of a customer 
code and a contractor code.

.P -10
#-21#cnt		- sheet index start/end

.P 0
In all forms except OSTF-0, the file starts with an index of the sheets
in the file. This is of the form:

.LM +5
.P0; #-21#cnt		how many sheets
.BR; EEEEEEEE		easting #of SW corner, sheet 1
.BR; NNNNNNNN		northing of SW corner, sheet 1
.BR; EEEEEEEE		easting #of NE corner, sheet 1
.BR; NNNNNNNN		northing of NE corner, sheet 1
.BR; #--etc--
.BR; #-21###0		end of index
.LM -5

.P -10
#-22#cnt		- text cross reference

.P 0
This is followed by 'cnt' FSNs, one per record. The entry is used within
a text feature, to point to the linear features with which this text is
associated. This entry is not used in OSTF-0 or OSTF-1, and is not always
required in the other forms.

.P -10
#-23#typ		- feature history

.P 0
This entry holds information on change type, survey date and change date, and 
applies only to the feature incorporating the record. The entry is:

.LM +5
.P0; #-23# type
.BR; YYMM# YYMM
.LM -5

.P 0
where 'type' is a character denoting the type of change. Values for this are:

.LM +10
.P -7
"0"##-#unknown
.I -7
"1"##-#feature no longer exists, i.e. deleted
.I -7
"2"##-#feature unchanged since survey date
.I -7
"3"##-#position of feature has changed due to resurvey
.I -7
"4"##-#position of feature has changed due to readjustment
.I -7
"5"##-#feature code os classification change
.I -7
"6"##-#other attribute change
.LM -10

.P 0
The second record consists of two 4 byte fields, the first being the survey 
date, and the second the change date.

.P -10
#-24#diff		- height

.P 0
This entry holds information on difference in height between ground and top of 
feature, measured height and capture method. It applies to all succeeding 
individual points, up to the feature terminator unless updated by a further 
occurrence.

.P 0
The entry is:

.LM +5
.P0; #-24# difference
.BR; c#zzzzzz
.LM -5

.LM +6
.P -6
where#'difference' is the difference in height in decimetres (4 bytes),
.BR
'c' is a character denoting the capture method, 
.BR
'zzzzzz' is the z-coordinate in centimetres (6 bytes).
.LM -6

.P 0
Empty (i.e. blank) 'difference' fields are inserted at the first occurrence of 
an unknown difference in height, and empty 'zzzzzz' fields at the first 
occurrence of an unknown measured height. Note that values of zero in either 
of these fields are regarded as valid. The difference in height is relative to 
the ground height.

.P 0
Values for the capture method are:

.LM +10

#-25###0		- technical security

.P 0
This entry indicates that the feature is deemed to be of a technically secure 
nature.

.P -10
#-44#fsn		- start of feature with large FSN

.P 0
This entry is used to store a large FSN, instead of the -4 flag. The actual
FSN represented is 'fsn'+10000, allowing FSNs in the range 10000 to 19999
to be stored. This entry is only used in OSTF-3.
