.HL 2 ^^^*Comparison of SICAD/GDB and IFF\*

.P 0
IFF is a feature orientated data format - data is separated into features, and 
each feature represents one 'thing' on the map. An integer feature code is used
to say what type of thing it is that the feature represents. A feature might
thus be a contour, or a house, or a river, depending on the type of map
being digitised, and the way that the data is to be used.

.P 0
SICAD/GDB format to some extent shares this concept of a 'feature', and a GDB 
file produced by I2GDB is essentially an ASCII representation of an
IFF file on a feature by feature basis.

.P 0
However, a fully structured SICAD/GDB file has imposed upon its constituent 
elements some form of feature hierarchy, referred to by the STU=n fields in the 
feature element 
header lines. As an example, an area feature consists of an area (FL)
element, consisting of line segments (LI), and each of these is defined by two 
point (PG) elements. In this way the line segment belonging to several higher 
level features need only appear once in full detail in the GDB file, and any 
further references to it only need refer to it by its unique element number 
(ENUM=n) in the element header line.

As IFF files have no such structure imposed upon them, each feature is 
decomposed appropriately and the components assigned a unique element number in
all but the simplest cases of sharing. 

.P 0
The decomposition of IFF features is dependent on the graphical type 
(GT) of the feature held in the FRT file, referenced by feature code (FC), so
it is essential that an appropriate FRT file is supplied to the program via
the /FRT = file-spec qualifier for each run of I2GDB.

Additional control is provided by the use of a parameters file.

.HL 2 ^^^*Feature Translation\*

.P 0 
The I2GDB Program Action section of this document gives the GDB
features output when particular IFF graphical types are encountered.
The user can control these by use of a parameters file which defines
translations where there are alternatives. 

Where a data field in required in the GDB and there is no direct equivalent in
the IFF file, the user may attach the value required by means of a feature
attribute (ancillary code) or a per-point attribute. For this purpose a
special section is set up in the FRT file.

The following ACD entries provide the basic set of parameters and descriptors
that the user may wish to use. In principle the ACD table may be extended to
include any other GDB descriptors.
.TP 10
.BL
.NOFILL
ACD TABLE 1 
!		Code	Name	Min	Max
ACD	C	1	PKZ			! point symbol
ACD	I	2	PNR	1		! point number
ACD	R	3	WAN	-360.0 360.0	! spline start tangent
ACD	R	4	WEN	-360.0 360.0	! spline end tangent
ACD	I	5	NDX			! cadastral offset x
ACD	I	6	NDY			! cadastral offset y
ACD	R	7	W 	-90.0	90.0	! area hatching angle
.FILL
.BL
When the converter receives a feature or point with an attribute from this
table it outputs the name and value of the  attribute, for example "WAN 45.0".
The value is output as an integer, real or 4-character string according to the
type of the ACD entry.

For attributes attached to a feature, a special extension exists for
character type attributes. If the value "USTX" or "ustx" is received,
then the text entry of the AC is used instead of its value. (See
IFF-FEATURE reference section for description of text entries of ACs).

.P 0 
Point heights, HGEL, will be output to a GDB file if a feature in
an IFF file has an AC 2 or AC 3 attribute. These attributes both
specify contour heights. Point heights will also be output if ZS
coordinates or CB coordinates with a 'Z' point attribute are used in
the IFF file.

.P 0
A cadastral symbol should be represented in an IFF file as a text
element with a text string of the form n1/n2. For example, in textual form:

.NOFILL

	NF 101
	FS 1
	ST
	100 700
	RO 0
	TX 123/4
	EF
.FILL

.HL 2 ^^^*Area Features\*
.P 0 
The I2GDB utility can prevent lines which are common to two areas being written
twice to the output file. This, however, requires the IFF file to be prepared
in such a way that the program will know if area lines are unique or are shared
with other areas in the same layer.
.P 0
For this to work correctly, the following points should be noted:
.LIST "o"
.LM+8
.LE;It will only apply to areas (ETYP=FL) intended to be written as
lines (ETYP=LI) as opposed to polylines (ETYP=LY). This must be
defined in the parameter file.

.LE;Each point of an area should be given a point attribute. This
attribute flags the line (which the point begins - in the direction
the area was digitised) as being common to another area. This
'shared-code' attribute should be a unique integer or zero. If it is
non-zero, it denotes the line as being common to another area (whose
corresponding line must have the same unique shared-code attribute on
the starting point of the line) and zero denotes that the line does
not belong to another area.

.LE;As areas may be digitised in any order, it is vital that the points
have the correct attributes associated with them and if this is not
the case, unpredictable results may occur.

.LE;Duplicate points are not eliminated by this process as only the ENUM
of each common ^*line\* is held.

.LE;Only areas with common lines that are in the same layer will be dealt
with.

.LE;The shared-code attribute should be included in the ACD part of the
FRT file and should be of type integer and called 'SHARED' as shown
here:

Consider the example below which consists of two areas, A and B, which have
two lines in common. The areas have been shown apart for clarity but do
actually coincide. The first point in each area is denoted by '_*' and the
arrow gives the direction in which it was digitised.
