MGD2I reads a magnetic tape in Marine Geophysical Data (MGD77) 
exchange format, and produces an Internal Feature Format (IFF) file for the 
specified map sheet in the input data. A 'map sheet' is a single file or 
dataset on the input tape.

.HL 2 ^^^*DESCRIPTION\*

.LM +10
.P0;MGD2I is a utility to transfer a map sheet from a
MGD77 format magnetic tape, to an Internal Feature Format (IFF) disk 
file. A 'map sheet' is a single file or dataset on the input tape. 
Sheets which span more than one tape should be treated as separate 
sheets on the different tapes, with separate IFF files being generated from 
each tape using MGD2I. These separate IFF files may subsequently be merged 
if required.

.P0;The user may specify which sheet to transfer by means of the /SELECT 
qualifier. The program will search forwards through the tape, counting the
number of end of file markers (tapemarks), until the tapemark before the
beginning of the required sheet is reached. 

.P0;If the /SELECT qualifier
is not used, or it is used to select sheet 1, no searching of the tape occurs, 
and the program begins to read from the current tape position. In this case, 
the user should ensure that the tape is correctly positioned immediately 
before the first header block of the required sheet.

.P0;If the /SELECT qualifier is used to specify some sheet other than the 
first, then the program will search forwards from the current tape position 
for tapemarks. The tape need not, in this case, be positioned 
at the start of a sheet.

.P0;If the tape read fails because the tape is at some unexpected position 
(because of a previous failure, or a user specified escape), the 
/SELECT qualifier must be used, possibly in conjunction 
with the /REWIND qualifier, to start again at a correct tape position.

.P0;Note that only a single map sheet may be transferred during a single run 
of the program.

.P0;The program performs no validation operations on any sheets which are 
skipped, when using the /SELECT qualifier, and does not check whether they 
are complete and correct MGD77 format datasets.

.P0;If the /DIAGNOSTICS qualifier is used on the command line, the program 
produces messages giving information about the sheets and blocks being read 
from the tape, and any errors or difficulties which may be encountered.

.P0;MGD2I transfers information from the header block or blocks of an MGD77 
format tape to a dummy feature in layer 0 of the output IFF file. The header 
information is held in a number of AC entries with codes as defined by the FRT 
file read by the program. The dummy header feature is given the coordinates 
of the local origin of the IFF file created by the program. In general, these 
will be the coordinates of the first data record in the input data.

.P0;MGD2I translates each MGD77 logical data record into an IFF feature record 
in the output file. The data features are contained in layer 1 of the IFF file 
and are ordered 
as in the tape file. The longitude, latitude and corrected depth of a data 
record are transfered to the X, Y and Z coordinates, respectively, of a ZS 
entry in the corresponding feature. If the corrected depth value is null (ie
99999), it is translated into an IFF undefined value. All the other attributes
are transfered to AC entries contained in the feature. The codes of these AC
entries are determined from the FRT file read by the program.

.P0;Some quantities, for example longitudes, may be subject to rounding errors 
in their final digit when the program transfers them from the MGD77 format 
tape file to the output IFF file. This will generally only occur for 
quantities such as longitude when all 8 of their potential significant figures 
(digits) are used (ie. greater than 99.99999 degrees). This rounding error
is inherent to VAX/VMS data storage methods. It may cause a positional
inaccuracy of less than 1 metre on the earth's surface.

.P0;The MGD2I program always refers to the types of the AC entries which it 
constructs using the same AC names. The user may alter the codes of the AC 
entries written to the output IFF file by changing the FRT file read by the 
program. The use of the FRT file is described in the 'Data Preparation' 
section of the documentation for this module. 

.P0;Details of the structure, content and characteristics of an MGD77 
format tape are to be found in the 'Data Format' section of this modules's 
documentation.

.P0;It is essential that the tape is mounted as a foreign volume prior to 
running MGD2I. This is achieved using the DCL command MOUNT with the /FOREIGN 
qualifier e.g. MOUNT MSA0:/FOREIGN.
