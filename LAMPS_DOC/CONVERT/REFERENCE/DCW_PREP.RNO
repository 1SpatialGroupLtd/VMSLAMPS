.HL 2 ^^^*Comparison of DCW and IFF\*

.P 0
IFF is a feature orientated data format - data is separated into features, and 
each feature represents one 'thing' on the map. An integer feature code is used
to say what type of thing it is that the feature represents. A feature might
thus be a contour, or a house, or a river, depending on the type of map
being digitised, and the way that the data is to be used.

.P 0
The DCW format shares this concept of a 'feature' but the various information
relevant to a single feature is held in several database tables which
reference each other using primary keys. Refer to the FORMAT DESCRIPTION
section for details of the structure of the DCW data.

.P 0
Features in DCW are identified not by a feature code or feature serial number,
but by one or more attributes. The mechanism used by DCW2I to determine the
feature code to be assigned to IFF features from DCW is via the Feature Code
Table. This associates one or two DCW attributes with a numeric IFF feature
code and must be defined prior to the conversion.

.TP 10
.P 0
^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL 2 ^^^*The DCW2I Feature Code Table Parameter File\*

.P 0
The Feature Code Table file is compulsory and relates one or two DCW attributes
in each feature table to an IFF feature code.

.P 0
In order to correctly define the Feature Code Tables, the user must have
access the DCW Product Specification which lists all the attributes present in
the DCW feature tables.

.P 0
It is important to realise that the feature code is only given to feature whose
attribute names and values exactly match those in the Feature Code Table so it
is vital that the FCT is accurate. The FCT is used to select only those
features required and so if the DCW table name or any of the primary/secondary
attribute name/values given in the FCT does not exactly match a particular
feature, it will be thrown away with no warnings to the user.

.P 0
The lines of the table are free-format, so the order of entries
matters, but the actual position of entries on the line is not important. 
Any line with the "!" character is regarded as a comment, and is 
ignored. Comments can appear at the end of lines containing fields, or on 
separate lines. Note that all text fields in the file will be upper cased
in order to match the attribute names in the DCW tables.

^*FC#######\*-#the feature code to be given to the IFF feature if the
^*DCWtable\* and any attribute names and values following match those in a DCW
database table. This value is compulsory and should be in the range 1 to 32767.
.I -11
^*DCWtable#\*-#the name of the DCW database Feature Table whose features will
be assigned the feature code of this entry. If no Primary or Secondary
attributes are given on the line, then all features in the Feature Table are
given the feature code. The name should contain the appropriate extension for
the class of table (ie. '.AFT', '.LFT', '.PFT' or '.TFT' for area, line, point
and text feature tables respectively).
.I -11
^*P-Att####\*-#the name of the Primary Attribute present in the ^*DCWtable\*
which contains a fixed attribute to be used when determining the feature code.
This field is optional since some tables do not contain any fixed attributes,
but if it is given, there must be an accompanying Primary Attribute value.
The feature code is assign to a feature which comes from the ^*DCWtable\* and
which has a Primary Attribute defined as ^*P-Att\* with value ^*P-Val\*.
.I -11
^*P-Val####\*-#the fixed value of the Primary Attribute, ^*P-Att\*, present in
the ^*DCWtable\* to be used when determining the feature code. This field is
optional but must be present if the Primary Attribute name is present. Primary
Attribute values are always of type integer.
.I -11
^*S-Att####\*-#the name of the Secondary Attribute present in the ^*DCWtable\*
which contains a fixed attribute to be used when determining the feature code.
If this field is present, there must be an accompanying Secondary Attribute
value. The feature code is assign to a feature which comes from the
^*DCWtable\*, which has a Primary Attribute defined as ^*P-Att\* with
value ^*P-Val\*, and has a Secondary Attribute called ^*S-Att\* whose value
is that of ^*S-Val\*.
.I -11
^*S-Val####\*-#the fixed value of the Secondary Attribute, ^*S-Att\*, present
in the ^*DCWtable\* to be used when determining the feature code. This field is
optional but must be present if the Secondary Attribute name is present.
Secondary Attribute values are always of type integer.

.HL 2 ^^^*The DCW2I Attribute Code Table Parameter File\*

.P 0
The Attribute Code Table file is optional and can be used to assign to certain
features any integer, date, or text attributes held in the DCW database.

.P 0
In order to correctly define the Attribute Code Table, the user must have
access the DCW Product Specification which lists all the attributes present in
the DCW feature tables.

.P 0
It is important to realise that an attribute will only be given to a feature
with the correct feature code and if the attribute name and datatype match
those in the Attribute Code Table, so it is vital that the ACT is accurate.
.P 0
The lines of the table are free-format, so the order of entries
matters, but the actual position of entries on the line is not important. 
Any line with the "!" character is regarded as a comment, and is 
ignored. Comments can appear at the end of lines containing fields, or on 
separate lines. Note that all text fields in the file will be upper cased
in order to match the attribute names in the DCW tables.

and should be in the range 1 to 32767.
.I -11
^*FC#######\*-#the feature code of the feature to be assigned the attribute.
This value is compulsory and should not only be in the range 1 to 32767, but
also match the feature code of the corresponding entry in the Feature Code
Table.
.I -11
^*Att-Name#\*-#the name of the attribute present in the ^*DCWtable\* of the
FCT defined by ^*FC\*.
.I -11
^*Att-Type#\*-#the datatype of the attribute defined by ^*Att-Name\* and must
be of type 'T' (text), 'I' (integer) or 'D' (date). Defining a value of type
'I' in the ACT allows DCW attributes of type 'S' (short integer) or 'I' (long
integer) to be converted. If the ^*Att-Name\* matches an attribute in a DCW
table, but the ^*Att-Type\* is wrong, a warning will be produced and the true
datatype from the DCW table will be used.

.HL 2 ^^^*Which Attributes To Put Into The FCT and ACT Parameter Files\*

.P 0
Certain attributes are defined in the DCW Product Specification as having
fixed values and these can be used to sub-divide a feature class into several
feature codes. The INT.VDT files listed in the DCW Product Specification lists
the fixed attribute values for integer attributes of the classes in that
coverage.

.P 0
The attributes to use should be of the form 'ccxxnnnn' where 'cc' is the
coverage mnemonic (eg. CL), 'xx' is the class (eg. PY, LN, PT for polygons,
lines and point resp.) and 'nnnn' is the remainder of the name of any length.
For example, HYLNTYPE is an attribute in the Hypsography line feature table.

.P 0
The attributes which should be put in the FCT and ACT depends on how general
a feature-coding scheme is required. If the Appendix of the DCW Product
Specification lists all the possible values for an attribute then in may be
used in the FCT to divide a class into more than one feature code.

.P 0
For example, the contours in the Hypsography coverage have an attribute
HYLNTYPE which can have possible values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 or 9 to distinguish
between contour types. This attribute could be entered in the Feature Code
Table with a feature code for each of the possible values thus:
.LIT

! FC  DCWtable   P-Att   P-Val  S-Att   S-Val
1050 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   1
1051 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   2
1052 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   3
1053 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   4
1054 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   5
1055 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   8
1056 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   9

.END LIT
This will ensure that each value of the HYLNTYPE attribute found in the table
HYLINE.LFT will result in the IFF feature being given a different feature code
to the others. As there is only one fixed attribute in the HYLINE.LFT, no
secondary attribute is possible.

.P 0
If a more general feature-coding scheme is required for the contours, just the
feature code value and the table name could be entered thus:
.LIT

! FC  DCWtable   P-Att   P-Val  S-Att   S-Val
1050 HYLINE.LFT

.END LIT
As there are no attributes defined here, no attributes in the table HYLINE.LFT
will be used to determine the feature code and all contour lines will be
assigned the feature code of 1050.

.BL 2
The attribute HYLNVAL contains the actual contour height which is not a fixed
attribute. It could therefore be entered in the Attribute Code File with the
AC number it is to be given and the feature code of the feature. The feature
code should match those in the FCT. For the first of the FCT examples above,
the corresponding ACT lines might look thus:
.LIT

! AC  FC   Att     Type
2010 1050 HYLNVAL    I
2010 1051 HYLNVAL    I
2010 1052 HYLNVAL    I
2010 1053 HYLNVAL    I
2010 1054 HYLNVAL    I
2010 1055 HYLNVAL    I
2010 1056 HYLNVAL    I

.END LIT
Note that the same AC code (2010) will be given to each of the feature
codes 1050 to 1056.

.P 0
The second FCT example could have a corresponding ACT entry which looks like:
.LIT

! AC  FC   Att     Type
2010 1050 HYLNVAL    I

.END LIT
Since there is only one feature code defined in the second FCT example, the ACT
only needs one AC defined to be attached to feature code 1050.

.BL 2
For an example of the use of primary and secondary attributes, refer to the
description of the Drainage line table, DNLINE.LFT, in the appendix of the DCW 
Product Specification.

.P 0
Attribute DNLNTYPE can have values 1 to 9 to classify the type of the drainage
feature. There could therefore be 9 entries in the FCT if that degree of
distinction is required between the types of drainage feature. Since this
attribute distinguishes between such diverse drainage features as rivers,
canals, shorelines and glaciers, the breaking down of these into different
feature codes is almost essential.

.P 0
A second fixed attribute, DNLNSTAT, has values which are only possible when
combined with values of the DNLNTYPE attribute. For example, DNLNSTAT values 1
(perennial), 2 (nonperennial) and 6 (unsurveyed perennial) only apply to
DNLNTYPE 1 (streams).

.P 0
Following the description of the DNLINE.LFT table is a table which defines the
legal combinations for drainage line attributes. This can be used directly
when creating the FCT for the Drainage line features which may look thus:
.LIT

! FC  DCWtable    P-Att   P-Val  S-Att   S-Val
2004 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   1   DNLNSTAT   1
2005 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   1   DNLNSTAT   2
2006 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   1   DNLNSTAT   5
2007 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   1   DNLNSTAT   6
2008 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   2   DNLNSTAT   3
2009 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   2   DNLNSTAT   4
2010 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   3   DNLNSTAT  99

2016 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   5   DNLNSTAT  99
2017 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   6   DNLNSTAT  99
2018 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   7   DNLNSTAT  99
2019 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   8   DNLNSTAT  99
2020 DNLINE.LFT  DNLNTYPE   9   DNLNSTAT  99

.P 0
^*----------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL 2 ^^^*Null Coded Attributes\*

.P 0
There are some attributes which are defined as NULL in the DCW database which
means that the attribute does not apply to a feature or that a feature is
incorrectly coded.

.P 0
A list of null coded attributes is present in the VPFVIEW User Manual which
should accompany the DCW CD-ROMs.

.P 0
A null coded attribute will have the value -2147483637 (80000001 hexadecimal)
and can be entered in the FCT as any other fixed attribute value thus:
.TP 8
.LIT

! FC  DCWtable    P-Att    P-Val
1018 LCAREA.AFT  LCPYTYPE  -2147483647    ! HOLES IN LAND COVER
1019 LCAREA.AFT  LCPYTYPE   1             ! RICE FIELDS
1020 LCAREA.AFT  LCPYTYPE   2             ! CRANBERRY BOGS
[etc]

.END LIT
For those cases where null codes occur there should not be a secondary
attribute present. Some occurrances of the null coded values may be ignored,
such as for attributes DQPYAHA and DQPYAVA since they are not used to determine
the feature code and need not be in the FCT. They may however be present in
the ACT file in which case the program will omit the attribute from the IFF
file if the value is a null code.

.P 0
.NOTE
Often, area features do not close because they have been incorrectly
coded in the DCW data as having NULL codes. For example, some line features
(rivers) in the DN (drainage) coverage are NULL coded as areas and never close
and so trying to build an area out of these will cause the TOOMANYEDGES
message. We therefore recommend that the NULL coded features ARE NOT PRESENT
IN THE FEATURE CODE TABLE so that they will be ignored.
