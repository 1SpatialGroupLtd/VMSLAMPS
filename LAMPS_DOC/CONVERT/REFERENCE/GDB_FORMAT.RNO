.P 0
The program I2GDB provides a translation from Laser-Scan's Internal 
Feature Format (IFF) to the SICAD/GDB (Geographical Data Base) ASCII disc file 
format.
For a brief comparison of the way IFF and GDB regard data, see the section 
on 'Data Preparation' below.

.HL 2 ^^^*The SICAD/GDB Format\*

.P 0
The IFF data is output to a SICAD/GDB ASCII disc file with the format 
defined in this summary.

.P 0
The basic unit of a GDB file is the feature element. Each element consists of
a header line which must contain the element type (ETYP=xx) and element number
(ENUM=n), and optionally the hierarchy level (STU=n), the overlay number (EB=n),
the line style (SM=n) and line thickness or colour (ST=n):

ETYP=xx STU=n ENUM=n EB=n ST=n SM=n

.FILL

.P 0
This header line is followed by a number of parameter and descriptor lines, the
number and type depending on the element type, and which consist of the 
parameter name and its value.

.P 0
It is the element type which describes what kind of object it is (and roughly
translates to the IFF graphical type), while the element number is a unique 
number assigned to each different feature component, and is the number by which
multiple occurrences of the same feature element are referenced. This means that
any element need only occur once in full detail within a GDB file, and any 
other features to which it belongs, and which belong to it, need only refer to 
this element number in a single line.

.P 0
The hierarchy level is required for the feature element types which are 
themselves composed of other element types. For example, a line segment in the 
top hierarchy (STU=1) consists of two point elements in a lower hierarchy 
(STU=2).

.P 0
Within any feature element parameter which requires coordinate information,
a HEX representation should be used if possible in preference to the actual 
real values to preserve accuracy on transfer to other formats. 

.P 0
SICAD/GDB format comprises many feature element types, of which only a subset
are used by I2GDB because of the relatively small number of distinct feature 
types (graphical type) used in IFF files. These are described below, with their
required relevant parameter fields.

.P 0
Any angles in the parameter fields are measured in degrees anti-clockwise from 
the horizontal.

.P 0
Most measurements in the parameter fields are in absolute ground metres.

.P 0
Any comment lines begin with a '_*'.

.HL 2 ^^^*The SICAD/GDB feature element structure\*


.P 0
The SICAD/GDB feature elements that are used in the I2GDB transfer routine
are listed below, together with their various required parameter fields.
The use of these feature elements for each of the IFF graphical types is 
described in the preparation section of this manual, and in the I2GDB transfer
description section.

PG#####Graphical Point element

relevant parameter field entry.

PKZ defines the type of symbol to use at the point/vertex if any; PKZ Z 
signifies that no symbol is to be used, and is therefore used in any PG
elements describing the lower levels of IFF linear features except for the
symbol string.

Other common symbols are
