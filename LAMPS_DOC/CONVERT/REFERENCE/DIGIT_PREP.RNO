.HL 2 ^^^*Comparison of DIGIT and IFF\*

.P 0
IFF is a feature orientated data format - data is separated into features, and 
each feature represents one 'thing' on the map. An integer feature code is used
to say what type of thing it is that the feature represents. A feature might
thus be a contour, or a house, or a river, depending on the type of map
being digitised, and the way that the data is to be used.

.P 0
The DIGIT format shares this concept of a 'feature' but does not identify
features uniquely as there is not provision for feature serial numbers.
I2DIGIT will write the whole file into one partition containing features
which can have upto six characteristics. These characteristics are defined
in the FORMAT DESCRIPTION section.

.HL 2 ^^^*Feature Translation\*

When converting from IFF to DIGIT, it is not possible to translate fully
some IFF graphical types. In fact the only features to be translated exactly
are linear features with GT 1 consisting simply of a string of coordinates.

.P 0
Arcs, circles and interpolated curves (GTs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) have the points
output directly from the ST entry and do not have their points created.
The parameter file should be used to give these features the appropriate flag.
(ie cubic or parabolic).

.P 0
All symbol features (GT 7,8 and 9) are output as lines of 2 pixels in length
so that the Scitex VTR operation will recognise them.

.P 0
All text features (GT 10) are ignored.

.P 0
Area fill features (GT 12) will not be automatically output with the relevant
closed flag present. This must be done explicitly via the parameter file.

.HL 2 ^^^*The I2DIGIT Parameter File\*

.P 0
This file contains the information needed when translating IFF features into
DIGIT features by associating certain characteristics with IFF feature codes.
This is essential for the successful conversion of IFF features into DIGIT
ones. Optional commands identical to certain command line qualifiers may also
be put in the table. The parameter file contains various commands and a table
section as described below :

.BLANK
.HL 3 ^^^*Optional Parameter Commands\*
.P 0
There are a number of commands which may be included in the parameter file
rather than on the command line as qualifiers. The command should begin the
line but not include the backslash ('/') and be followed by the appropriate
value(s).
.P 0
If the same command is given in the parameter file and on the command line as
a qualifier, then the qualifier value will be used. If no command is given at
all where one is required, a default value will be used. The default values
are documented with each qualifier.
.P 0
The available commands are BORDER, OFFSET, RESOLUTION, SCALE__FACTOR,
SCALE__IFF, SCALE__SHEET, XMIN, XMAX, YMIN and YMAX which are identical to the
qualifiers of the same names. Refer to the I2DIGIT COMMAND QUALIFIERS section
for a description of each qualifier.
.P 0
See the sample parameter file below for examples of the available commands.

.BLANK
.HL 3 ^^^*The DIGIT Translation Table\*
.P 0
Each line of the table is prefixed with a command which identifies the line as
belonging to that table. The lines are free-format, so the order of entries
matters, but the actual position of entries on the line is not important. 
Any text starting with the "!" character is regarded as a comment, and is 
ignored. Comments can appear on the same lines as commands, or on 
separate lines. Note that commands may be in upper or lower case.
.!** and can be abbreviated to the shortest non-ambiguous form.

.P 0
The DIGIT translation table describes the translations required to produce
DIGIT feature characteristics from IFF features.  The characteristics are
described below. Each line is prefixed with the 'DIGIT' command which tells
the program that the line in the parameter file is part of the translation
table.

characteristics. This should be in the range 1-32767.

^*font###\*-#the DIGIT font number in the range 0-999. However the value may
be -1 to denote it is undefined, in which case it will not appear with this
feature in the DIGIT file.

.BL
.I -9
^*line###\*-#the DIGIT line width in the range 1-99. However the value may be -1
to denote it is undefined, in which case it will not appear with this feature
in the DIGIT file.

.BL
.I -9
^*curve##\*-#the DIGIT curve type number in the range 1-3. The values of these
represent the following curve types:

.LIT

      1) - Linear
      2) - Parabolic
      3) - Cubic

.END LIT
.LM -5
The curve type may be -1 to denote it is undefined, in which case it will not
appear with this feature in the DIGIT file.

.BL
.I -9
^*term###\*-#the DIGIT termination number and may be 4, 5 or 9. The values of
these represent the following terminations:
.LM+5
.LIT

      4) - Open/Straight
      5) - Closed
      9) - Open/Round Ends

.END LIT
.LM -5
The termination may be -1 to denote it is undefined, in which case it will not
appear with this feature in the DIGIT file.

.BL
.I -9
^*prio###\*-#the DIGIT line priority in the range 6-8. The values of these
represent the following priorities:
.LM+5
.LIT

      6) - Low
      7) - Normal
      8) - High

.END LIT
.LM -5
The priority may be -1 to denote it is undefined, in which case it will not
appear with this feature in the DIGIT file.

.BL
.I -9
^*col####\*-#the DIGIT line colour in the range 1-12. This value may be -1
to denote it as undefined, in which case it will not appear with this feature
in the DIGIT file.
