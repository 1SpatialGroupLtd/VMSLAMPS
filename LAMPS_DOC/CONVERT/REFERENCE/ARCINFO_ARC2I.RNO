ARC2I reads an uncompressed ARC/INFO EXPORT tape or disk file and produces a
Laser-Scan IFF file. If EXPORT attributes are desired in the translation, a
parameter file must be specified to reflect how they will be represented in the 
IFF file. This parameter file is used in conjunction with the ACD part of an
FRT file.

.LM +10

.P -10;input-EXPORT-file-spec

.P -2;-#This parameter specifies the name of the input EXPORT file, and is
compulsory. The data written to the output file is read from this file. Only
one filename may be specified each time the program is executed.
.BL
The default device and extension 'SYS$DISK:filename.E00' is applied to the 
input file specification when it is parsed.
.BL
When processing files on tape, the input file name should be the magnetic
tape device which has been mounted with /FOREIGN. The EXAMPLES section shows
tape files being processed.

.TP 8
.P -10;output-IFF-file-spec

.P -2;-#This optional parameter specifies the name of the output IFF file
which contains the data converted from the input EXPORT file. If the parameter
is not given, the output file will have the same name as the input file but
with the default device and extension 'LSL$IF:filename.IFF' applied where
'filename' is the input file name.
.BL
When processing tape files, this parameter is only permitted if the /SELECT
qualifier was also given with one argument. This file-spec is then given to the
single tape file. If /SELECT was missing or given with more than one argument,
the output file-spec is ignored as each output file will have the coverage
name held in each EXPORT file.

.HL 2 ^^^*COMMAND QUALIFIERS\*

.LM +10

.BL;
.P -10;/ARC__ID=keyword
.I -10;/ARC__ID=USER__ID (default)
.P -2;-#This qualifier specifies which fields to use when matching arc
attributes to their features. The two fields available are the User-ID and the
Internal-ID fields and so the keywords are USER__ID and INTERNAL__ID.
.BL
The first field of each line feature in the ARC section is the Internal-ID and
the second is the User-ID. Note that this is the opposite way around to the LAB section.
.BL
The first seven default attributes in the Arc Attribute Table (AAT) contain
two ID attributes, at least one of which should have values which reflect the
User-ID or Internal-ID of the ARC section. The attribute called the coverage
.! to make the # come out as a character
.NO FLAGS SPACE
name followed by a '#' is the Internal-ID (eg COVERAGE#) and the attribute
.FLAGS SPACE
called the coverage name followed by '-ID' is the User-ID (eg COVERAGE-ID).
.BL
The field that is used to match features must be unique and sorted so that 
each entry in the AAT table matches exactly the entry in the corresponding
ARC section.
.BL
If this qualifier is not given, the User-ID field will be used to match any
attributes to their features.

.BL;
.P -10;/BLOCKSIZE=integer
.P -2;-#This qualifier is used to specify the magnetic tape blocksize. The
blocksize does not have to be exactly divisible by the EXPORT format record
size (80 characters). The program will process files whose records span tape
blocks. The default block size is 8000 and the maximum is 65535.

.BL;
.P -10;/FRT=file-spec
.P -2;-#specifies a Feature Representation Table (FRT) file which the program
will use to interpret the AC entries specified in the parameter file. In order
for the program to do this, there must be an ACD section in the FRT. The FRT
file-spec is parsed against the default LSL$FRT:file-spec.FRT. This qualifier
must be used when the parameter file is given.

.BL;
.P -10;/ID__TO__FC
.I -10;/NOID__TO__FC (default)
.P -2;-#This qualifier is specifically for use with data supplied by
Bartholomews. It is used to extract Feature Codes (FC) of features from their
User-ID fields in the EXPORT file. Since IFF will only hold a maximum FC number
of 32767, the ID will be subject to some adjustments before being used as a
feature code. These adjustments area as follows:
.BL
.TP 6
.LM +5
.P -2; -#User-IDs of zero are removed.
.I -2; -#User-IDs which are less than 32768 are left unchanged.
.I -2; -#User-IDs between 32768 and 139000 (inclusive) have their
.I -1;  #first 3 digits removed.
.I -2; -#User-IDs which are greater than 139000 will have their
.I -1;  #first 2 digits removed.
.LM -5

.BL
These adjustments will only produce unique feature codes for IDs greater than
32768 if the EXPORT file contains a certain set of IDs that will not conflict
with others when they have their digits removed.
.BL
Use of this qualifier overrides the default FCs and the ones held in the
parameter file. It only applies to linear and point features. Text feature will
have the default feature code or that defined in the parameter file.
.BL
Users of other ARC/INFO data may safely use this qualifier to extract the FC
from the User-ID field providing the values are less than 32768.

.TP 8
.BL;
.P -10;/LOG
.I -10;/NOLOG (default)
.P -2;-#When /LOG is present, the ARC2I utility will output diagnostic messages
about any file creation and what is happening as it processes the  input EXPORT
file so that any errors may be traced.

.BL;
.P -10;/PARAMETER=file-spec
.P -2;-#specifies the parameter file, which defines the transformation of EXPORT
attributes into IFF AC entries. It is used in conjunction with the ACD section
of the FRT file. For a description of the parameter file, see the DATA
PREPARATION section.

.BL;
.P -10;/POINT__ID=keyword
.I -10;/POINT__ID=USER__ID (default)
.P -2;-#This qualifier specifies which fields to use when matching point
attributes to their features. The two fields available are the User-ID and the
Internal-ID fields and so the keywords are USER__ID and INTERNAL__ID.
.BL
The first field of each point in the LAB section is the User-ID and the second
is the Internal-ID number. Note that this is the opposite way around to the
ARC section.
.BL
The first four default attributes in the Point Attribute Table (PAT) contain
two ID attributes, at least one of which should have values which reflect the
User-ID or Internal-ID of the LAB section. The attribute called the coverage
.! to make the # come out as a character
.NO FLAGS SPACE
name followed by a '#' is the Internal-ID (eg COVERAGE#) and the attribute
.FLAGS SPACE
called the coverage name followed by '-ID' is the User-ID (eg COVERAGE-ID).
.BL
Often the LAB section will have unique User-ID values for polygon seeds but
zeros in the second field (the Internal-ID) and so the /POINT__ID need not be
given as this is the default.
.BL
The field that is used to match features must be unique and sorted so that 
each entry in the PAT table matches exactly the entry in the corresponding
LAB section.
.BL
If this qualifier is not given, the User-ID field will be used to match any
attributes to their features.

.BL;
.P -10;/REWIND (default)
.I -10;/NOREWIND
.P -2;-#This qualifier defines whether the magnetic tape device is to be
rewound ^*BEFORE\* processing begins. When initialising the tape, the default
is to ensure that the tape is at the beginning. The /NOREWIND is useful when
processing very large volumes of tape data that needs to be removed in sections
so that the /SELECT values do not start from the beginning of the tape.

.BL;
.P -10;/SCALE=integer
.P -2;-#This is to specify the scale of the output IFF file which is used to
update the scale in the Map Descriptor (MD) entry and to convert text heights
into hundredths of a millimetre on the sheet in the IFF (TH) entry. If no /SCALE
qualifier is given, the Map Descriptor is left blank and the text entries will
have heights taken directly from the EXPORT file.

.BL;
.P -10;/SELECT=(integer[,...])
.P -2;-#used to select the files to be processed by their position on tape. The
maximum number should not exceed the number of files on the tape. The /SELECT
qualifier will accept single, multiple or ranges of integer arguments. Ranges
may be specified with starting and ending integers that are separated by a
colon, for example /SELECT=2:4. When specifying more than one range they should
be separated with a comma, for example /SELECT=(2:4,6,8:10). The EXAMPLES
section shows the use of this qualifier.
.BL
The arguments to /SELECT are relative the position of the tape head which will
depend on the use of the /REWIND qualifier.
.BL
For example, to convert files from tape in groups of ten:
.BL
.LM+5
If using /NOREWIND, the program should be invoked using /SELECT=(1:10)
repeatedly because the tape head will remain after each group of ten files.
.BL
If using /REWIND, the program should be invoked using /SELECT=(1:10) and then
/SELECT=(11:20) and so on, because the tape head will return to the start of
the tape each time. This will slow the process down as the program has to skip
files until it reaches the desire position.
.BL
If, however, it is required to start reading the tape from say the 51st file
from the beginning, to reach this point use /SELECT=(51:60) and thereafter
(with /NOREWIND) use /SELECT=(1:10).
.LM-5
.BL;
.P -10;/VERBOSE
.I -10;/NOVERBOSE (default)
.P -2;-#When /VERBOSE is present, the ARC2I utility will output detailed
information about the ordering of the Internal-IDs of points and arcs. It is
intended for use when attributes cannot be associated with their respective
arcs or points due the Internal-IDs being in a different order. It should be
noted that the program only makes a limited attempt to correct the attribute
ordering in the AAT and PAT tables and file should ideally contain unique,
ordered Internal-IDs.

^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HL 2 ^^^*RESTRICTIONS\*

.LM +10

.P 0
ARC2I can only convert EXPORT files that are created with no compression. This
implies that you can list the file on your terminal and read the strings of
numbers which make up the arc and points etc. The ARC/INFO TAPEWRITE facility
will produce compressed files by default and this should be overridden by
specifying 'NONE' as the last command on the line to disable the compression.

.P 0
ARC2I produces unstructured data with no polygonal information. This can be
achieved in IFF using IMP utilities ILINK and IPOLYGON.

.P 0
All attributes associated with line features must be held in the .AAT coverage
table in the IFO section and attributes associated with point features must be
held in the .PAT table. Attributes held in any other table are ignored.

.P 0
ARC2I does not handle unloaded text. Any text within the EXPORT file is taken
from the TXT (or TX6) section of the file and not from any updated text
section in the form of a .TXT table under the IFO section.
It is therefore essential that the updated text is loaded back into the TXT
section of the EXPORT file.

.P 0
If there are TXT entries in the EXPORT file with more than 2 points defining
the arc or spline along which a text feature lies, they are ignored. ARC2I will
only produce text features with no orientation or with an orientation equal to
the angle between the origin and the line defined by the first two points in
the feature.

.P 0
The program partially supports ARC/INFO version 6.0 annotation text features
as held in the TX6 section. The extent of the support is as follows:
.list "o"
.lm+2
.le;BANKED TEXT#-#IFF composite text features will be created if the ARC
feature has the relevant information defining it as composite.
.le;ANGLED TEXT#-#Text with one point will have an orientation (IFF RO
entry) of zero. Texts with two points will have an orientation equal to the
angle between the two points.
.le;BENT TEXT#-#Text digitised to follow an arc or curved feature is not
supported. If the bent text consists of one component, then its orientation
will be defined as the angle between the first and last points of the curve.
If the text contains multiple components along one curve, each component will
start on a point of that curve. Each component will therefore be oriented
at the angle defined by the first and last point for each component's segment
of the curve. The last point of a component's curve segment is the point
before the one which starts the next component.
.le;STRETCHED TEXT#-#Text features will not be stretched in anyway to fit
between points, be it by inserting additional spaces or by breaking the text
string up into individual component characters.
.le;TEXT ATTRIBUTES#-#ARC/INFO Version 6.0 text attributes are no currently
supported. Any text attribute tables (TAT) will be ignored.
.lm-2
.end list 0

.P 0 
The EXPORT sections ARC, LAB and TXT (or TX6) are assumed to appear in this
order in the file. (ie alphabetical).

.P 0
Only single .E00 files can be processed as ARC2I does not handle continuation
files (.E01, .E02 etc). Therefore the 'max__lines' argument to the ARC/INFO
EXPORT facility should not be invoked.

.P 0
The program only makes a limited attempt to correct any discrepancies with the
attribute ordering in the AAT and PAT tables and files should ideally contain
unique, ordered Internal-IDs.

.P 10
ARC2I == "$lsl$exe:arc2i"
.P 0

.BLANK
.HL 3 ^^^*Parameter File\*

This file contains the attribute description table which describes the
translations required to produce IFF AC entries from EXPORT attribute data held
in the .AAT and .PAT tables. The format of the table is described in the DATA
PREPARATION section under the heading 'The ARC2I parameter file', and it will
probably have been set up by the LAMPS system manager and remain relatively
static at most installations.

.TP 10
.BLANK
.HL 3 ^^^*Program Action\*
.P 0
After decoding the command line, the program creates a temporary file which
consists of a copy of the IFO section of the EXPORT file. This is used to
process the ARC and LAB sections in parallel with IFO section in case
attributes from tables such as the .AAT or .PAT need to be given to features.
This temporary file will have the name 'filename.ARC2I__TMP' where 'filename'
is the output filename.
.bl
The IFF file is now created containing the IFF RAnge (RA), History (HI),
Map Header (MH), Map Descriptor (MD), New Section (NS), Cubic Coefficients (CC)
and Corner Point (CP) entries. The CP information being those values in the .TIC
table of the IFO section. If this table contains more that four points,
then a maximum/minimum box is calculated for the area.
.bl
The EXPORT ARC section is now processed to extract the arcs within the file
and these are written to the IFF file with Graphical Type (GT) 1. The default
feature code for these line features is FC 1 unless the parameter file was
specified. If so, the feature code will be the value associated with the
DEF__LINE  command. If the .AAT table is present and contains attributes that
are correctly defined in the parameter file, then the linear feature will be
given the associated attribute in the form of an IFF AC entry.
.bl
Label points are now created using the information held in the LAB section of
the EXPORT file. These symbols have GT 8 and the feature code will be the
default of FC 2 or the DEF__SYMBOL in the parameter file if it was given. Any
associated attributes, correctly defined in the parameter file, will be taken
from the .PAT and assigned to the symbol feature as an AC entry. This will only
be done if the label point ID number taken from the LAB section matches the
label point ID number in the .PAT entry. It is therefore important that the
order of the LAB entries matches that of the .PAT entries if the attributes are
to be maintained in the translation.
.bl
Any text features will now be extracted from the TXT section if the file was
created from an ARC/INFO system before version 6.0. The orientation of the
text depends on the number of points specifying the line along which it
lies. One point will result in an orientation of zero. Two points will result
in an orientation between the origin and the line created by these first two
points. Points in excess of two are ignored as ARC2I does not create text
features that follow an arc or spline.
.bl
Files created by ARC/INFO version 6.0 or later will have annotation extracted
from the TX6 section of the file and appropriate text features created. See
the RESTRICTIONS section for detail of the level of support for ARC/INFO
version 6.0 text.
.bl
Text features will be of GT 10 and can be assigned a feature code in one of
three ways. If the LEVEL and SYMBOL codes of the text feature in ARC matches
an entry in the parameter file, it is given that features. If this is not the
case and the DEF__TEXT value was defined in the parameter file, it will be
assigned this feature code. Failing both these condition the default feature
code of 3 is used.

.bl
Finally the range (RA) entry information in the IFF file is updated to reflect
all points within the file which is then closed. The temporary file is closed
and deleted and providing no error occurred, the user should never see this
file.

This example shows the result of processing a disk file with an output filename
specified to prevent the the IFF file having the same name as the input file. It
also shows a warning message being generated due to a problem with an attribute
called 'TYPE'. This message means that the value of TYPE was held in the EXPORT
file as a floating point number but had a conflicting datatype specified in the
FRT. Usually, if there is a problem with an attribute it will not be written
to the IFF file rather than writing a value that is incorrect. The message can
be ignored unless the attribute 'TYPE' is desired in the output IFF file in
which case the relevant action should be taken and the program run again.
