				VPF

VPF is the Vector Product Format. It is a late addition to a family of
standards referred to as DIGEST, and produced by a group of NATO nations
under the banner of DGIWG (Digital Geographic Information Working Group).

VPF is described in the document MIL-STD-600006 available from the US DoD. 
This describes it as "a standard format structure and organisation for large
geographic databases that are based on a georelational data model and are
intended for direct use". 

VPF doesn't fit the general DIGEST family, but was added late in response
to pressure to inclde a relational table form of geographic data. ESRI
(of ARC/INFO) had a large hand in its definition.

VPF data is held in the form of a large number of files, each one holding
a relational table. The data is divided into horizontally into tiles, 
vertically into coverages (layers), and logically into features, attributes, 
edges, faces, rings, lines, etc. The data model for particular coverages
can be either spaghetti or topologically structured.

Its main use so far has been as the medium for distribution of the DCW aka
Digital Chart of the World CD-ROM data. This is defined in the DCW Product
Specification (MIL-D-89009) available from the DMA. DCW is three CD-ROMs
holding a large amount of vector mapping of the world derived from TPC and
ONC navigation charts, available cheaply from the DoD.

Laser-Scan have written a convertor to read VPF data from the DCW CD-ROMs
into IFF, because it was needed by a large customer (MCE).
