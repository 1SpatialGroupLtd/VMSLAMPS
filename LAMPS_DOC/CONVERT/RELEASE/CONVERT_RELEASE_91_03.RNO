Details of CONVERT functionality and commands can be found in the
latest edition of the CONVERT User's Guide. 

.P 0
This document covers changes to package CONVERT since the previous general
release of LAMPS software, which was frozen ready for issue in August 1990. At
that time, the extant version of CONVERT was described as V8.4 of 01-Aug-1990.
See the CONVERT release notes for the previous LAMPS release for information
about earlier changes.

.le;23-October-1990 - Module IFFOSTF
.list
.le;^*I2OSTF\* - Modified to translate an IFF type 3 MH entry to OSTF -1 and
-20 header records. The  program reads the translation table, described in the
DATA PREPARATION section of IFFOSTF, in order to obtain the position and length
of the header in the OSTF file.

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New qualifier /MH__CHECK added to check for consistancy
between the Eastings, Northings and scale of a type 3 MH entry and those in 
the MD entry.

.le;^*OSTF2I\* - Modified to have the ability to copy an OSTF header to the
IFF MH entry as a type 3 header. The position of the -1 and -20 header records
in the OSTF file are obtained from the translation table described in the
DATA PREPARATION section. The Eastings, Northings and scale are also obtained
via the positions in the table and their values inserted into the MD entry.

.le;^*OSTF2I\* - New qualifier /MH__TYPE added to specify the type of the IFF
MH entry.

.le;^*OSPIF\* - Modified to handle type 3 or 4 map headers. The positions of
the BGI, job number and capture scale are obtained from the translation table
and the values read from the header for inclusion in the display. The Eastings,
Northings and storage scale are obtained from the map descriptor.

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - New section added to DATA PREPARATION
explaining how the translation table LSL$OS__MH__TABLE is set up.

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - I2OSTF documentation updated to reflect
changes made by qualifier and the handling of the new type 3 map headers.

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - OSTF2I qualifier documented along with
a description of how OSTF headers are converted to IFF as type 3.

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - OSPIF documentation ammended to describe
how type 3 and 4 map headers are handled.

.list
.le;^*OSTF2I\* - Bug fixed concerning the reporting of sheet numbers with the
/SELECT qualifier (SPR 958).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New qualifier added:
.bl
/[NO]PROCESS__CODES
.br
/NOPROCESS__CODES  (default)
.bl

.I 7;-#specifies whether or not process codes (-16 records) are output. The
default action (/NOPROCESS__CODES) will suppress them and /PROCESS__CODES will
cause them to be output to the OSTF file.

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New qualifier added:
.bl
/BYTE__COUNT (default)
.br
/NOBYTE__COUNT
.bl

.I 7;-#specifies whether or not a file byte count is to be calculated and
written to the normal position in a type 2 IFF OS map header. A type 3 IFF OS
map header (for use by Ordnance Survey Great Britain only) will have the byte
count inserted into the header at the position specified in the translation
table, LSL$OS__MH__TABLE. For more information on the translation table, refer
to the DATA PREPARATION section in the IFFOSTF chapter.
.BL
The byte count will be the total of all countable characters (as per the OS
specification) from the first space of the -1 record (typically '~~-1~~~0') to
the last character of the -2 record (typically '~~-2~~~0') of the OSTF file
(inclusive).
.BL
/BYTE__COUNT is the default and involves processing the IFF file twice; the
first time to calculate the byte count and the second to write the OSTF file.
.BL
^*NOTE:\* There may be a significant increase in processing time due to the
byte count and for those users who do not require it, there is the facility to
disable it with /NOBYTE__COUNT.
.bl
.NOTE ^*Warning\*
The new qualifers, /PROCESS__CODES and /BYTE__COUNT, are incompatible changes
which involves specifying them as /PROCESS__CODES and /NOBYTE__COUNT to make
the program behave as it used to.
.END NOTE
.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - I2OSTF documentation updated to include
the new qualifiers /PROCESS__CODE and /BYTE__COUNT.

.TP16
.le;21-December-1990 - Module IFFOSTF
.list
.le;^*I2OSTF\* - Bug fixed. This was introduced in the OS Map Header changes
and caused the header of the last IFF file in a sequence being used when 
processing all the files.

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New qualifier /IFF__POINTSIZE added to specify that IFF text
heights are taken to be in units of point sizes. /NOIFF__POINTSIZE specifies 
that IFF text heights are taken to be in hundredths of a mm. /IFF__POINTSIZE
is the default (SPR 917).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New warning message BADMMSZ added which flags that an IFF 
text height, taken to be in hundredths of a mm, has no equivalent OS point
size, and informs the user of the point size that will be used. This message
will only arise when outputting OSTF-0 data with the /NOIFF__POINTSIZE
qualifier (results from SPR 917).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - modified so that a -23 OS record is output for each
feature, whatever the revision levels of the IFF files, whenever OSTF+ output
is required. This is a manditory requirement of OSTF+ data. The modifications
will also cause a -25 OS record to be output to an OSTF+ file whenever a
SECURITY__MARKER AC (OSTF+ type AC) is encountered, again whatever the
revision levels of the IFF files (SPR 992).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New warning message, PLUSAC, added which flags the presence
of OSTF+ type AC's, SURVEY__DATE, CHANGE__DATE, CHANGE__TYPE, or 
SECURITY__MARKER in a revision 0 IFF file. These AC's should only be present
in revision 1 IFF files (results from SPR 992).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - modified so that I2OSTF checks to see if every IFF feature
has an associated orientation. This is a mandatory OS requirement. Empty
features or line features degenerating to points are ignored (no associated
OS output generated). Any text string or symbol feature lacking an orientation
will cause the program to abort. A vertical line will also cause the program
to abort (SPR 994).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - New messages added, BADFEATURE, IGNORE, NORIENT, which relate
to the testing of IFF features. BADFEATURE is an informational message which
informs the user of the FSN of a corrupted IFF feature (may be output after
a NOTFOUND fatal error message). IGNORE is a warning message which will be
output if the IFF feature test procedure has detected an empty feature or a
line feature which degenerates to a point. It gives the FSN of such features.
NORIENT is an error message which informs that a text string, symbol, or
non-degenerate line has been detected which has no orientation. NORIENT also
gives the FSN of the feature (results from SPR 994).

.le;^*OSTF2I\* - New qualifier /IFF__POINTSIZE added to specify that IFF text
heights are to be output in point sizes. /NOIFF__POINTSIZE specifies that IFF
text heights are to be output in hundredths of a mm. /IFF__POINTSIZE is the
default (SPR 917).

.le;^*OSTF2I\* - New warning message BADOSSZ added which flags the presence of
an unsupported OS text height point size and informs the user of a substituted
value. This message can only arise with OSTF-0 data when the /NOIFF__POINTSIZE
qualifier is used (results from SPR 917).

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - I2OSTF documentation updated to include
the new qualifier /IFF__POINTSIZE and the new messages: BADFEATURE, BADMMSZ,
IGNORE, NORIENT, and PLUSAC.

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 3 - OSTF2I documentation updated to include
the new qualifier /IFF__POINTSIZE and the new message BADOSSZ.

This first version of ARC2I does not perform the following:

.list
.le; Attributes associated with arcs, text, label points and polygons are not
handled and will be lost in the translation.
.le; Input EXPORT files cannot be read from a magnetic tape device. Files can be
removed from a tape written using the ARC/INFO TAPEWRITE command by mounting the
tape using:
.bl
.lm+10
^*MOUNT/FOREIGN/BLOCKSIZE=8000/RECORD=80 MT:\*
.lm-10

output to magnetic tape is now only generated during second passes through
IFF files (SPR 1072).

.le;^*I2OSTF\* - Bug fixed. When /BYTE__COUNT is in effect, the program now
returns the correct byte count (SPR 1074).

header is found but the /OS qualifier is not given (SPR 831).

.le;^*I2NTF\* - Add extra functionality for the /WATER__DISTRIB qualifier (SPR 
1055) :
.p0
If /WATER__DISTRIB has been specified, an additional field must be included in 
the feature classification file. A value 'T' or 'F' must be appended to each 
FCODE in the file, to indicate whether or not the associated feature code 
should be referenced with a NODEREC record.

.end list 0


.le;11-February-1991 - Module IFFDXF
.list
.le;^*I2DXF\* - New /POINTSIZE qualifier to treat text height TH 
entry values as point sizes, rather than the default /NOPOINTSIZE which uses
the usual values of mm./100. All values are converted into mm. for the DXF 
text height group 40 entry. Note that /POINTSIZE must now be used to 
reproduce the program's previous default action of treating TH entry values as 
point sizes (SPR 1021, 991).

.le;^*I2DXF\* - Z coordinates from ZS entries output to group 3n coordinate
fields. AC type 2 and 3 heights converted to group 38 entity elevation fields
(SPR 991, 1062).

.le;^*I2DXF\* - DXF file deleted on error, unless /LOG qualifier given 
(SPR 1012).

.le;^*I2DXF\* - Remove call to OSMH__UPGRADE.


.le;^*DXF2I\* - New /POINTSIZE qualifier to convert DXF group 40 text height 
(in mm.) into point sizes for the IFF TH entries, rather than the default 
/NOPOINTSIZE which outputs the usual values of mm./100. 
Note that /POINTSIZE must now be used to 
reproduce the program's previous default action of converting to TH entry 
values as point sizes (SPR 1021, 991).

.le;^*DXF2I\* - Group 3n z coordinate values output to ZS entries. Group 38 
elevation values output to AC type 3 height entries (SPR 991, 1062).

.le;^*DXF2I\* - Remove duplicate EM and EJ entries (SPR 1012).

.le;^*DXF2I\* - IFF file deleted on error, unless /LOG qualifier given.
(SPR 1012).

.le;^*DXF2I\* - DXF2I no longer completely disregards any entity without a 
group 62 colour field, but ignores the colour in deriving the feature code from 
the parameter file, using the first occurrence of entity type and style
(SPR 1011).

.le;15-February-1991 - Module IFFOSTF
.list
.le;^*OSTF2I\* - If there are either too many or too few fields inserted before
the -1 and -20 flags in a type 3 header then the error messages OSTF2I__SHORTHDR
and OSTF2I__LONGHDR are output accordingly (mods 943 and 962). The new
error message OSTF2I__LONGHDR is as follows:

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
LONGHDR, the -20 header was longer than expected in type 3 header
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
The secondary sheet header (after the -20 flag) of a type 3 map header was
longer than the size given in the translation table LSL$OS__MH__TABLE. The
longer header will be written as an ASCII block to the IFF file.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
Check for consistancy between the header length of the OSTF file and the
size given for this in the translation table LSL$OS__MH__TABLE.

.le;^*OSTF2I\* - Relinked to include new version of the OSMHLIB library
(mod 942).

.le;8-March-1991 - Module IFFARCINFO
.list
.le;^*I2ARC\* - New qualifiers and parameter file facility added to handle
attributes in a way that complements the new ARC2I method. The program can
use an ARC2I parameter file and produce the standard .AAT and .PAT ARC/INFO
tables. The new qualifiers are:
.bl
/[NO]INFO__TABLES
.br
/NOINFO__TABLES (default)
.bl
.I 7;-#When /INFO__TABLES is present, the I2ARC utility will put any AC
attribute information into ARC/INFO .AAT and .PAT tables rather than the .IAC
and .RAC ones. The .AAT and .PAT tables are the standard way of holding
attribute information within ARC/INFO and are described in the FORMAT
DESCRIPTION section of the IFFARCINFO chapter.
.bl
If the qualifier is present, then /PARAMETER must also be used which
describes the attribute names as they appear in the EXPORT tables. If the
qualifier is not present (or negated), the parameter file is not required and
any attributes are written in the form of the .IAC and .RAC tables. This is the
default action.

.bl
/PARAMETER=file-spec
.bl
.I 7;-#The /PARAMETER command qualifier specifies a parameter file which holds
information about the translation of attributes into the output EXPORT file. It
is used in conjunction with /INFO__TABLES as it only describes the attributes
that go into the .AAT and .PAT tables. A description and an example of the
parameter file can be found in the DATA PREPARATION section of the IFFARCINFO
chapter.

PREPARATION section describing parameter file mechanism for handling
attributes differently in I2ARC.

.le;^*Convert User Guide\* Chapter 13 - Documentation updated in I2ARC section
to include the two new qualifiers and a description of an alternative method of
handling attributes. A number of new warning and error messages have also been
added to this utility.

.le;^*NTF2I\* - Efficiency of conversion of attribute information improved
so that the execution time of NTF2I is speeded up (M 973).

.le;^*NTF2I\* - Error message NTF2I__NOCOMPARE is now a warning message
and the program comtinues execution instead of terminating after this
message (M 973).

.le;^*I2IMAP\* - Number of attribute definitions allowed in parameter file
increased from 50 to 250.
Check now made that maximum number of attribute definitions in the 
parameter file is not exceeded. New error TOOMANYATTDES produced if so
(SPR 1142).
.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
TOOMANYATTDES, Too many attribute descriptions, max is 'number'
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
There are too many attribute description records in the 
parameter file. The LINEINPAR message indicating the parameter file
line number will follow, and the program will continue to read the file,
ignoring this line.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
Amend the attribute definitions in the parameter file, and if necessary run
the program again.
.TP 10
.le;^*ARC2I\* - Can now process an uncompressed ARC/INFO EXPORT file containing
double precision real numbers. (ie ones having a field width of 24). These
files can be created using the ARC/INFO command 'PRECISION' with argument
'DOUBLE' and the map written using the 'EXPORT' command. The lines in the
EXPORT file denoting the ARC, LAB and TXT sections should all have a value of
3 as in: 'ARC  3', 'LAB  3' and 'TXT  3'.
