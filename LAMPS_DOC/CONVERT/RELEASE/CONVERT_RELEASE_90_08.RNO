.HL 1 ^&CONTENT\&
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software package
CONVERT. This package provides interface facilities between Laser-Scan's
internal feature format (IFF) and other known mapping systems through
standard transfer formats for data.

.P 0
Details of CONVERT functionality and commands can be found in the
latest edition of the CONVERT User's Guide. 

.P 0
This document covers changes to package CONVERT since the previous general
release of LAMPS software, which was frozen ready for issue on 10-Nov-1989. At
that time, the extant version of CONVERT was described as V4.7 of 10-Nov-1989.
See the CONVERT release notes for the previous LAMPS release for information
about earlier changes.

.list
.LE;^*NTF2I\*#-# At NTF level 3 the feature code of any point or line feature must occur 
in an [ATTREC] associated with that feature. It should be specified using one 
of the default NTF attribute mnemonics FC, LC or ST.

.LE;^*NTF2I\*#-# Invisible line sections (indicated by the _{QPLAN_} field in [GEOMETRY*] 
records) are not understood. All lines will be output as visible lines, with a 
warning message if an invisible section is detected.

.LE;^*NTF2I\*#-# At level 3, the [GEOMETRY*] and [ATTREC] records associated with a 
feature must occur either before or immediately after the feature record 
itself. If both records occur after the feature record, then the [GEOMETRY*] 
record should precede the [ATTREC] record. Similarly, a [NAMEREC] record may 
be associated with one or more [NAMPOSTN] records but each such record must 
occur either before or immediately after the [NAMEREC] record.

.LE;^*NTF2I\*#-# Any [FEATCLASS] records are read and the contents written to the log 
file. At level 3 the fields in these records are used to convert feature codes 
stored as LC or ST attributes to the FC form required in IFF features. If a 
[FEATCLASS] record does not contain a value in the _{FEAT__CODE_} field the 
[FEATCLASS] record number will be used.

.LE;^*NTF2I\*#-# New error messages FEATCLASS and NOCOMPARE. New warning 
message TOOMNYREC.

.LE;^*I2NTF\*#-# Bugs fixed in output of [ATTDESC] records. Response to SPR 
815.

.LE;^*I2NTF\*#-# New qualifiers /DBNAME, /DDNAME, /DDATE, /FCNAME, /FCDATE, 
/FEATCLASS__FILE to provide values for [DBHREC] and [FEATCLASS] records.

.LE;^*I2NTF\*#-# New qualifier /WATER__DISTRIB, used to indicate that the NTF 
output is to match the specification given in the document "Specification for 
representation of North West Water's digitised distribution overlays in NTF 
level 3 format", produced by ISTEL (Jan 1990).

.LE;^*I2NTF\*#-# Curved text and invisible line sections implemented.

.LM +4
.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADFCLAYER, Feature FSN='integer' occurs in more than one layer
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
I2TDST will not work unless all features have
previously been sorted into order by feature code.  ISORT/FC will only 
feature codes within layer and so features with the same feature code should 
not appear in more than one layer.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
Ensure features of same feature code do not appear
in more than one layer before using ISORT/FC to sort features by FC.

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
BADFCORDER, Feature FSN='integer' is not in order by feature code
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
I2TDST will not work unless all features have
previously been sorted into order by feature code, using ISORT/FC,
so that all features within a layer with equal feature code are contiguous.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
Use ISORT/FC to sort features by FC before running
I2TDST.

.LM +4

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
RANGEWRONG, DST Range inconsistent with coordinate data
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
The range information in the header of the DST file does not 
agree with the coordinates in the main body of the file.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
None; the IFF range will be calculated from the coordinate
information.
