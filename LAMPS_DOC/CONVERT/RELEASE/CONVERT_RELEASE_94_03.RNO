.HL 1 ^*CONTENT\*
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software package
CONVERT. This package provides interface facilities between Laser-Scan's
internal feature format (IFF) and other known mapping systems through
standard transfer formats for data.

.P 0
Details of CONVERT functionality and commands can be found in the
latest edition of the CONVERT Reference Manual.

.! Put this paragraph back at the time of the freeze. It was commented out for
.! customers who received software upgrades between releases.
.!
This document is part of the LAMPS V4.3 release, which went into Alpha test
in January 1994. It covers changes to package CONVERT since the previous
LAMPS release (V4.2) which went into Alpha test in July 1993. See the
release notes for the previous LAMPS release for information about earlier
changes.

.list
.le;^*IMAP2I\*#-#The number of attributes permitted in the parameter file has
been increased from 50 to 250 for consistency with I2IMAP. This has been linked
with version 3.4-4 of Informap (SPR 2379).
.le;^*IMAP2I\*#-#A new message TOOMANYATTDES has been added which is
reported when the number of attributes in the parameter file exceeds the
current limit (now 250). The messages is defined as follows:
.P 0
.LM -5
.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
TOOMANYATTDES, Too many attribute descriptions, max is 'number'
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
There are too many attribute description records in the 
parameter file. The LINEINPAR message indicating the parameter file
line number will follow, and the program will continue to read the file,
ignoring this line.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
Amend the attribute definitions in the parameter file, and if necessary run
the program again.

.le;^*ARC2I\*#-#A bug has been fixed when reading attributes from the AAT and
PAT attributes tables when these tables contain double precision real numbers.
Before this was fixed, the line attributes when read into IFF were offset by 4
characters and point attributes were offset by 8 characters (SPR 2387).

.le;19-October-1993 - Module IFFNTF
.list
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The program now detects duplicate adjacent points in line
features and removes them from the output NTF or CITF file as requested in
SPR 2389. If two adjacent
points on a line have the same X and Y coordinates (in NTF/CITF form) but
have different Z values then both points are kept. This is the only case where
adjacent points can have the same planimetric coordinates and any differences
in other per-point attributes are not considered. This is consistent with
LITES2 which can be made to keep points with the same coordinates if the
Z values differ. A message is output for every point removed since it should
not happen often, providing the output precision is set appropriately for the
data. The message is described as follows:
.BL
.LM -5
.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
DUPPTS, duplicated points in feature with FSN 'fsn' (point 'number')
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
The duplicated points are the point numbered in the message and the
previously accepted point (normally the previous point, unless it was also
duplicated). IFF coordinates have a smaller resolution than NTF/CITF
coordinates, so points which are very close in IFF may be equal on translation
to NTF/CITF. This can happen with lines, and since there is no need for
spurious data, the duplicated points are ignored.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
In the case of lines, determine why successive points are so close. Generated 
curves, arcs and circles may exhibit this problem if their construction 
tolerances were very small. The problem can also occur where lines have been 
clipped to sheet edges, and existing points were already positioned very close 
to the edge. If many occurrences of this message occur, it may be due to the
combination of XY__LEN and XY__MULT giving rise to poor output precision and
adjusting these may resolve the problem.
.LM +5
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#If after having duplicate output points removed, a line feature
has less than two points left, no NTF/CITF feature will be created and the
following message is given:
.BL
.LM -5
.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
DEGEN, Line feature degenerates to 1 point - FSN 'fsn' deleted
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
When converting a line feature to NTF or CITF which has lower precision,
duplicate output points are discarded and this has resulted in a line feature
reducing to fewer than two points. The implication of this is that no 
corresponding feature was created in the output file.
.P0; ^*User action:\*
The IFF feature with the reported FSN may be examined using LITES2 if its
removal causes concern.
.LM +5

.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The attribute description [ATTDESC] records are now output
correctly when writing CITF data. Previously, three divider characters were
omitted (SPR 2445).

.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The {NO__ACRDREC} value of the [SUMMREC] record now contains
the correct count of all of the [ACRDREC] records in the CITF file (SPR 2447).

.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#CITF orientations will now fall in the range 0 to 3599
(in tenths of degrees). This applies to the `OR' attribute and to the {ORIENT}
field of a [NAMPOSTN] record (SPR 2472).

presence of any temporary files after the program has finished and deletes
them (SPR 2446).

{FEATDES} field terminated by a DIVIDER character (usually '_\').

.le;^*I2DXF\*#-#There is a new qualifier /DECIMAL__PLACES = n to enable the
user to specify the number of decimal places output in the x,y coordinates.
The number specified must be between 1 and 9.
This may be useful for the output to DXF of IFF files where the coordinate
values are small in magnitude, and resolution is to be preserved.
The output will remain as before with the default of 3 decimal places if this
qualifier is not specified (SPR 2540).

.le;^*I2DXF\*#-#A bug in the POLYLINE output routine which failed to output
separate features at invisible line breaks has been fixed. Also single point
POLYLINE entities are not created any more, and a warning SINGPNTDEL given
to warn the user. These single points can arise from the closing invisible
moves in nested polygon features.

include this new functionality.

.le;18-January-1994 - Module IFFNTF
.list
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#A bug has been fixed in the detection of duplicate points at
level 3. The symptom was that when a line feature degenerated to one point
and hence was to be discarded, the [GEOMETRY] record was still output.
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The program now correctly outputs all DIVIDER ('_\') characters
in [ATTDESC] records in accordance with NTF v1.1 (SPR 2528).
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The /PARAMETER__FILE qualifier now works correctly with the
exception of attempting to override boolean qualifiers in the parameter file
with same qualifier on the command line but negated. This exception is due
to negated qualifiers being treated as if they were absent (SPR 2531).
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The program now always outputs an [ATTDESC] record for
attributes `FC' (feature code) and `OR' (orientation) for version 2.0 NTF at
level 3 (SPR 2530).
.le;^*NTF2I\*#-#The program has been modified to correctly skip over and ignore
default attributes in order to locate and read the desired attribute.
.le;^*NTF2I\*#-#A bug has been fixed in the scaling of the IFF rotation (the
`RO' entry) value as obtained from the `OR' attribute. The attribute was a
factor of 1000 too large when its interpretation is R6,3 (SPR 2526).
.le;^*NTF2I\*#-#The program will now correctly read datasets containing
multiple sections resulting in the creation of an IFF file for each (SPR 2519).
.le;^*NTF2I\*#-#The program now handles the SVY__DATE__FIRST__LAST field in the
[SECHREC] record correctly. Since this maps onto a field in a type 2 Map
Header (MH) entry which has provision for a month component, the first month
(Jan) is assumed (SPR 2525).

.le;^*I2ARC\*#-#A bug has been fixed so that the correct number of bytes
holding the attributes is written to the AAT and PAT attribute tables
(SPR 2574).
.le;^*I2ARC\*#-#A bug has been fixed in the formatting of attribute names
in the attributes tables. I2ARC will not now truncate attribute names or
shift the AAT or PAT columns over when names exceed 15 characters (SPR 2574).
.le;^*ARC2I\*#-#A bug has been fixed in the reading of 2 byte integer
attributes as represented in the AAT and PAT tables as type 5. The symptom
was that the reading of attributes became out of step and often caused the
program to stop with the error message, ERRRDNUM (SPR 2575).

.le;^*I2DXF\*#-#The message ERRFNDFC has been reduced in severity from error
to warning. It now just warns the user that there is a feature code referenced
in the parameter file that is not in the supplied FRT file. This used to halt
the program, unnecessarily as the FC in question may not be in the IFF file.
Now as a warning, the program continues to read all feature codes in the 
parameter file, with their DXF translation if present in the FRT file. It is
still possible to omit
feature codes from the translation, by omitting them from the parameter file.

character position of the [VOLHDREC] record. This denotes that the default
End or Record (EOR) character is being used. This affects NTF version 1.1 and
2.0 as well as CITF (SPR 2624).
.le;^*I2NTF\*#-#The program now uses Carriage-Return (<CR>) as the EOR
character writing NTF v2.0 data to tape as defined in the NTF standard
BS7567. The '%' character is still used as the EOR character for disk files.
