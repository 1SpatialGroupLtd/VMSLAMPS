.HL 1 ^&BUGS FIXED\&
This release corrects the following bugs that have been found to exist
in your current release:-

.LIST

.TP 10
.P -5;^&Module IFFOSTF\&

.LE;^*I2OSTF\*#-#if the IFF coordinates of points in line features are very
close together, they may have the same OSTF coordinates after conversion. The
duplicated points are now ignored and a warning message is output. Previously
only the first two points in a feature were checked. 

.LE;^*I2OSTF\*#-#survey dates, change dates and change types are now validated 
before conversion.

.END LIST 0

.HL 1 ^&NEW OR CHANGED FACILITIES\&
The following utilities have been added, implemented or had their actions
altered:-

.LIST

.TP 10
.P -5;^&Module IFFOSTF\&

.LE;^*I2OSTF\*#-#produces new style OSTF -1 and -20 header records (OSTF-4) 
with /OSTF__VERSION=4 (the default). Other versions are still available, 
although fields in the header which are obsolete in OSTF-4 will be empty if 
OSTF-3 or earlier is output.

.LE;^*I2OSTF\*#-#/CONTRACTOR now takes a 4 character string instead of an 
integer. The first two characters are the primary code and the second two 
characters are the secondary code. This is an upwards compatible change, so 
that e.g.
.NOFILL
		/CONTRACTOR=2		will be interpreted as
		/CONTRACTOR=0002
.FILL

.LE;^*I2OSTF\*#-#messages which refer to the number of blocks output now 
describe them as OSTF blocks.

.LE;^*OSTF2I\*#-#accepts either old or new format OSTF -1 and -20 header 
records, allocating fields to the correct locations in the new format OS IFF 
Map Header entry.

.LE;^*OSTF2I\*#-#the text size equivalents used on input to IFF have been 
amended so that the point size for the next tabled millimetre size is taken 
instead of 24 point.

.LE;^*OSMHED\*#-#works on new style OS IFF headers only. The output format
produced with /LIST and the input prompts have been amended to reflect the
changed format. /FULL causes obsolete fields to be output but these fields
cannot be edited. New commands have been introduced for the new fields, while
others have become obsolete. Old style headers are converted to the new style
automatically, unless /READ__ONLY is specified. 

.LE;^*OSMHED\*#-#years in date fields are all displayed as yyyy - input is of 
the form [yy]yy

.LE;^*OSMHED\*#-#day,month,year dates are now displayed as dd/mm/yyyy - input 
is of the form [d]d/[m]m/[yy]yy

.LE;^*OSPIF\*#-#outputs some of the header text slightly differently to reflect 
the changes in the map header.
