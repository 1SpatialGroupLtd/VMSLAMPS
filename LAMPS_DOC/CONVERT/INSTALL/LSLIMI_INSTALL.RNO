.P 0
INFORMAP is a spatial information handling system from Synercom Technology Inc,
which is particularly aimed at the Utility (Gas, Water, Electricity...) markets.
It is sold and supported in the UK by Laser-Scan.
.P 0
This document describes an installation procedure for an optional Laser-Scan
extension to Informap which provides data conversion to and from UK national
transfer formats. The formats supported currently are NTF, OSTF, and DMC. 
The option is called "The Laser-Scan Informap Interface", and referred to
as LSLIMI for short.
.P 0
This guide is intended to be of use to personnel carrying out an initial
installation or upgrade of LSLIMI on a system which already has the Informap
product installed. Note that this will usually be staff with knowledge of
Synercom and Laser-Scan software, and hence this manual makes 
assumptions about prerequisite knowledge in these areas. 
As the installation procedure uses the DEC VMSINSTAL tool, it is also assumed
that the user is already familiar with general use of a DEC VAX series computer
and of the VMS operating system, with some background in VMS system management.
.P 0
The LSLIMI interface is built round the use of the standard Laser-Scan on-disk
map data format known as IFF (Internal Feature Format).This is used as an
intermediate format between the magtape-based transfer formats and the Informap
internal format. 
.P 0
The Laser-Scan Informap Interface (LSLIMI) is made up of modules from the
Laser-Scan CONVERT package, together with support environment: 
.NOFILL

	Package CONVERT	  module  LSLIMI	Command files
	Package CONVERT   module  IFFIMAP	Utilities 
	Package CONVERT   module  IFFOSTF	Utilities 
	Package CONVERT   module  IFFNTF	Utilities 
	Package MAPPING	  module  IFFSHR	Shared Image
	Package LSLSYSTEM module  LSLSHR	Shared Image

The installation creates directories as follows:
.NOFILL

STI__ROOT:[LSL.EXE]	! Executable images
STI__ROOT:[LSL.COM]	! Command procedures
STI__ROOT:[LSL.LIB]	! Shared images
STI__ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP]	! lookup files
STI__ROOT:[LSL.DATA]	! input data files
STI__ROOT:[LSL.TEMP]	! temporary files

This manual has a section describing prerequisites for installation, and
then a section describing in some detail how to carry out an installation.
A log of a typical installation is attached as Appendix A.

.HL 1 ^^^*Installation Prerequisites\*
.P 0
To start installation of LSLIMI software requires access to the following
resources: 
.LIST
.LE
A DEC-supported
VAX, MicroVAX, or VAXstation configuration running the VMS or MicroVMS
operating system.
.LE
The Synercom Informap product already installed and running.
.LE
The media distribution kit for LSLIMI,
and a suitable drive for reading the kit. In the examples that follow
this is assumed to be a TK50 cartridge tape drive named MUA0:.
.LE
The documentation for LSLIMI (CONVERT package documentation).
.LE
At least 4000 blocks disk space must be available on the disk which holds
the Informap software (STI__ROOT:) for peak requirement, dropping to below 2000
blocks net.
.LE
As the installation procedure uses the DEC VMSINSTAL tool, it is necessary to
log on as System Manager (user SYSTEM), and have available the DEC
documentation for VMSINSTAL. For VMS V5, this is Chapter 3 of the "VMS System
Manager's Manual". 
.END LIST

.PAGE
.HL 1 ^^^*Installation Procedure\*
.P 0
.LIST
.LE
Ensure that the prerequisites in section 2 above have been met.
.LE
Logon as user SYSTEM to the system manager's account.
.LE
Invoke VMSINSTAL by typing a command of the form:
.BL
	$ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL LSLIMI MUA0:
.BL
Note that if the distribution kit is not a TK50 cartridge, or if an alternative
drive is to be used, then the "MUA0:" above must instead be the device name
of the drive holding the kit.
.LE
The installation procedure responds with a series of messages, starting
.BL
	VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.m
.LE
The messages are followed by a series of questions. You must answer Y, N, or
? for help. The bracketed response is the default.
.LE
The installation procedure now asks you to mount the first (or only) volume
of the kit on the drive. Answer YES when ready.
.LE
The procedure then continues with the following messages:
.BL
	The following products will be processed:
.BL
	LSLIMI Vn.m
.LE
The procedure then reads the kit saveset.
.LE
The procedure then asks if you want to purge
files replaced by this installation. If you have edited any comand files
from a previous release of LSLIMI, you may want to say NO to this question.
.LE
The procedure will create any directories necessary, move files to their
destination directories, and will tidy up. 
.LE
When the kit has been sucessfully installed, you receive the following messages
and the procedure returns you to DCL level.
.BL
	Installation of LSLIMI Vn.m completed at hh:mm
.BL
	VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm
.END LIST

.APPENDIX EXAMPLE INSTALLATION
There follows a log of a successful re-installation of LSLIMI V1.0,
followed by a directory listing of the installed files.
Note that the messages about DECNET networks and active processes should
not appear if you have followed the DEC procedure for VMSINSTAL and isolated
the system.
