.BR; ^^^*MODULE DTITILE\*

.P 0; DTITILE will either merge up to 8 DTI (*Digital *Terrain *Image) files
into a larger DTI output file, or will extract an area of interest from an
input DTI file and write this to a separate DTI output file. In addition
DTITILE may be used to create void areas in a DTI file. 

.P 0;The data in all the input DTI files should be at the same grid resolution
(no grid interpolation is performed). 

.P 0;The output DTI file will be produced at the same grid resolution as the
first input DTI file 

.P 0;Changes of DTI file grid resolution should be performed first using the
DTITRANS utility. 

.P 0;DTITILE offers the following features:

.LIST "o"

.LE
joins DTM grids generated by the DTMCREATE package or other systems which use 
DTI files.

.LE
creates void areas or areas of constant value in the DTI file.

.LE
very efficient amalgamation algorithm.

.LE
is command driven.

.LE
on-line help and full user documentation.
