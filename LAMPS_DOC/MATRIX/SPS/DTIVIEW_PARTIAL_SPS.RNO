.BR;^^^*MODULE DTIVIEW\*

.P0; The module DTIVIEW allows elevation data held in a grid DTM to be viewed as
a 3-dimensional image.  The module has facilities to generate a 3-D terrain
image using either a parallel (isometric) or perspective projection. The
terrain image may be output to a range of vector graphic devices, or to an IFF
vector file. 

.BL
The main features of DTIVIEW are:
.LIST "o"
.LE; Use of the whole or part of a digital terrain matrix
.le; DTM sub-sampling
.LE; Registration of the DTM to a source document positioned on a digitising
table
.LE; Isometric or perspective view generation
.LE; Production of a fishnet representation
.LE; User control over the direction, height and distance of viewing position
.LE; User control over the vertical and horizontal rotation of the model,
and vertical exaggeration
.LE; Generation of a terrain profile between 2 points
.LE; Output to a colour graphics device with:
.LIST "-"
.LE; Full or split screen display
.LE; User positioning and scaling of image, or autoscaling and positioning
within the plotting area
.LE; User control over colour representation
.LE; User definable colour lookup table
.LE; Annotation with user text and legend
.LE; Independent manipulation of the terrain view and any vector overlay or
user annotation
.END LIST
.LE; Output to an IFF vector file for subsequent plotting on a pen or
photo-plotting device
.LE; Command menu input
.END LIST

.P0; The facility to overlay data describing surface features (eg. rivers and
woodland) upon a 3-D terrain image is available with the TVES module
DTIVIEWEXTRA.
