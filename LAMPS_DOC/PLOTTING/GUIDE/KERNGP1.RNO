.CHAPTER ^^^*KERN GP1 flatbed plotter\*
.INDEX FPPKERNGP1

Image FPPKERNGP1.EXE produces output suitable for a KERN GP1 flatbed
plotter.

.HL 1 ^^^*Mode of operation\*
The program produces output on logical name LSL$KERNGP1. This logical
name is usually assigned directly to the plotter serial line, but may
under some circumstances be assigned to a file for transmission to the
plotter later. For example 
.NOFILL
.P 0
$ Define LSL$KERNGP1 TXA1:
or
$ Define LSL$KERNGP1 KERN.DAT
.FILL

.P0
If the logical name LSL$KERNGP1 is not set up, then the file KERNGP1.DAT
is produced.

.HL 1 ^^^*Plotting area\*
When operating on line, FPPKERNGP1 will only plot in the area above, and
to the right of the currently set origin. It assumes that the size of 
paper available extends from the origin to the upper right corner of the
currently set window. This is the area used by the POSITION command, so,
for example, the command POSITION 0 will plot as close as possible to
the currently set origin, while the command POSITION 8 will plot in
the top right corner of the currently set window.

.HL 1 ^^^*Number of pens\*
The Kern GP1 is usually supplied with a two pen drawing head. Features
that have a colour index greater than 2 will be drawn with either pen 1
or 2 (depending on whether the index is odd or even). 
.BL
To specify a different number of pens (for example if the GP1 is fitted
with a four pen drawing head, or if mono plots are required) the logical
name LSL$KERNGP1__PENS can be set to the number of pens available. 
.BR
Features that have a colour index greater than this number will be drawn
with the corresponding pen in the available range; e_.g_. if 
LSL$KERNGP1__PENS has been set to 4, a feature with colour index 5 would
be drawn with pen 1 while a feature with colour index 12 would be drawn
with pen 4.
.NOFILL
.KEEP

$ Define LSL$KERNGP1__PENS 4   allows four different pens to be used
$ Define LSL$KERNGP1__PENS 1   forces all plotting to be drawn with pen 1

.HL 1 ^^^*Messages\*
This program is linked with a library supplied by KERN. This library
is called GP1LVF, and on occasions it produces its own error messages.
These messages are preceded by the name "GP1LVF", and are generally
self-explanatory.
.BL
This library requires that the plotter is set up to use "Xon / Xoff"
protocol. If the plotter has been set to use the "ACK / NACK" protocol
then FPP will fail with the GP1LVF error message
.NOFILL
.KEEP

GP1LVF - Please set GP1 to "XON-XOFF" protocoll (transmission-mode 2)

.NOKEEP
.FILL
after the first IFF command has been given. In this case it will be
necessary to set the GP1 to transmission mode 2 by selecting Test 0
on the GP1 hand controller. (See KERN GP1 Manual for more details)
