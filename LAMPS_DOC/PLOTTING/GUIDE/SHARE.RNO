.TITLE FPP shareable images
.P 0
There are 26 published versions of FPP, plus about 5 others. In order
to reduce the task of re-building FPP when it changes, it has been
decided to use a single FPP image, invoking a variety of GKS shareable
images, so only one image need be re-built when FPP changes.
.P 0
Most customers run FPP by e.g. $ RUN LSL$EXE:FPPBEN. In order to
allow them still to do this, a driver image called e.g. FPPBEN.EXE
will be provided, but this will merely invoke the single main
FPP image (FPPSHR.EXE) having set up logical name LSL$GKSSHR to
point to the appropriate GKS (GKSBENSHR.EXE in this example). Another
advantage of the separate small driver images is that they can set
up the default WORKSTATION type to be the same as what the customer
was used to.
.P 0
For this to be possible, the main FPP image is itself a shareable
image, but this fact does not prevent it being run directly by a
user, provided that the LSL$GKSSHR logical name is set up.
.P 0
Because of a VMS bug, shareable images tend to be larger than a
functionally equivalent executable image. A link option
"unsupported=1" cures this, but as its name suggests, it is perhaps
not to be relied upon. This should be fixed in a future release
of VMS (known not to be fixed in VMS 5.0).
.P 0
A number of customers have been using FPPHCBS, having set up logical
name LSL$HCBSSHARE to point to an appropriate Calcomp HCBS lookalike
shareable image, but in some cases where using FPPHCBS would have
been possible, a specific FPP was still used, mainly because of the
difficulty of ensuring that the logical name was set up correctly.
In this new release, all FPP versions capable of using an HCBS shareable
image will do so, but this will be transparent to the user.
For example (taking the LSL Benson version again), FPPBEN.EXE will
define LSL$GKSSHR to be GKSHCBSSHR.EXE, define LSL$HCBSSHARE to
be HCBSBEN.EXE, and then run FPPSHR.EXE, with a default workstation
type appropriate for FPPBEN. However the user may still assign
LSL$HCBSSHARE himself, and then run FPPHCBS, producing the same
effect except possibly for a different default workstation type.
.P 0
The new images should work at a customer site without them having
to make any changes to symbols or logical names. The only
new requirement is that FPPSHR.EXE and GKSxxxSHR.EXE must be on
search list LSL$EXE - they should be there unless the customer
is trying to run them from other directories for some reason.
.P 0
The way in which the above has been acheived is as follows:
All device specific information for version FPP'ver' is contained in
two files: 'ver'BLK.SRC contains parameter and data statements defining
the version name and default workstation type; FPP'ver'.OPT contains
the link instructions for the GKS and below for this version.
.P 0
The FPP.COM command file now only offers the opportunity of building
FPPSHR.EXE or such images as do not use FPPSHR (these are FPPHRD and
FPPLWS). These are built by
compiling the device dependent block data DEVBLK.SRC which includes
'ver'BLK.SRC on logical name DEVDAT, and then linking using FPP.OPT
(main FPP modules + COORDLIB + LSLFRTLIB), FPP'ver'.OPT (device
dependent), plus LSLSHR and IFFSHR. 
.P 0
GKSSHR.COM allows the GKS shareable images (GKS'ver'SHR.EXE) to be
built. These use a transfer vector GKSVEC.MAR. They are linked using
GKSSHR.OPT (constant options) and FPP'ver'.OPT (device dependent). 
.P 0
FPPDRV.COM allows the device specific driver programs to be built.
The main program is FPPDRV.SRC, which includes 'ver'BLK.SRC on
logical name DEVDAT. These programs also have the name FPP'ver'.EXE
(the same as the old versions). These have a size around 10 blocks,
whereas the old versions are nearer 300 blocks.
