.CHAPTER ^^^*Precision Image C448 electrostatic plotter\*
.INDEX FPPPI448
The Precision Image C448 electrostatic plotter may be used by Laser-Scan
programs FPPPI448 (package PLOTTING), and ROVERPI448 (package TVES).
.HL 1 ^^^*Colour table\*
The Precision Image C448 colour electrostatic plotter differs from normal
pen plotters in that the colours produced by a particular colour index
(from an FRT file, for instance) may be defined by the user. In this
respect, the plotter resembles a colour display terminal. The Laser-Scan
programs initially define the colours by reading a disc file on logical name
LSL$PI448__COLOUR. The format of this file is the same as that used
for the VAXstation and Tektronix displays, and the same file may be used,
although it will probably be found that changes are necessary to get
the desired colours on the Precision Image plotter. Also white should not
normally be used (except perhaps as an overlay colour in ROVER),
as it will be invisible against the white paper
background. FPP will use the colours defined by the file on logical
name LSL$PI448__COLOUR for the plot, while ROVER always reads in
another table subsequently (LSL$LOOKUP:ROVER5.DAT by default, or others
by use of the PLANES command, or explicitly by use of the LUT command).
An example colour table file is given in Appendix A.

.HL 1 ^^^*Paper size and pixel size\*
FPP always has the concept of a sheet, in which it positions the plot
according to the command given by the user. On the Precision Image plotter,
the sheet is assumed by default to be 1.1704x0.8636 metres.
.P 0
ROVER always fills the whole sheet, which is assumed to consist of
1152x850 pixels for the purpose of displaying a raster image. Since
this may produce a plot which is too large, a means is provided to
change the sheet size, and the number of pixels.
.P 0
Logical name LSL$PI448__SIZE may be set to to point to a file containing
a single line with 4 real numbers defining the x size (metres), y size
(metres), x number of pixels, and y number of pixels, thus to give the
same effect as the defaults, the file would have the single line:
.NOFILL
1.1704 0.8636 1152 850
.BR
.FILL

.HL 1 ^^^*Plotting mode\*
The PI C448 plotter by default plots in transparent mode, which
means that where parts of the plot overlap, the inks will be combined,
generally giving darker colours. It also has the ability to plot in opaque
mode, where anything drawn replaces what is there already (underlying colours
do not show through).
.P 0
Several mechanisms are provided to select the drawing mode, to satisfy the
needs of the programs FPP, ROVER, and LITES2.
.LIST "o"
.LE
By default FPPPI448 plots in transparent mode. The command ESCAPE 1 will
cause opaque mode to be used for subsequent plotting, while ESCAPE 2 will
revert to transparent mode. As an alternative, giving the command WORKSTATION
1000 before beginning a plot will select opaque mode initially.
.LE
By default, ROVERPI448 draws the vector overlay using opaque mode, so that
the colours replace any underlying colour. In order to allow the overlay to
be transparent, define the logical name LSL$PI448__TRANSPARENT (as anything).
.LE
By default, LITES2 will draw any data in overlays whose base plane is greater
than zero in opaque mode. If it is required to draw everything in transparent
mode, then either define the logical name LSL$PI448__TRANSPARENT (as
anything), or give the command PLOT TYPE 1000 (before PLOT OPEN). Any number
other than 1000 will revert to the original behaviour.
.P 0;As an alternative to the above mechanisms, the PLOT ESCAPE command may
be used, in the same way as for FPPPI448. The command PLOT ESCAPE 1 will
switch to opaque plotting, while PLOT ESCAPE 2 will revert to transparent
plotting.
.END LIST

.HL 1 ^^^*Plotter interface\*
If the plotter is connected to the computer by a serial line, then the baud
rate should be set as high as possible on plotter and computer for
fastest data transfer (e.g. 19200 baud).
.P 0

.HL 1 ^^^*Producing plots\*
The plotting programs send their output to to a file with logical
name LSL$PI448.
This may be assigned either directly to the plotter or to a disc file, thus
for example
.NOFILL
$ Define LSL$PI448 TXA0:
.FILL
This will send output directly to the plotter on serial line TXA0:, or
.NOFILL
$ Define LSL$PI448 PI448.PLT
.FILL
This will send output to the disc file PI448.PLT in the current
directory. The file may subsequently be plotted by
.NOFILL
$ COPY PI448.PLT TXA0: (assuming plotter is on TXA0:)
.FILL
or possibly using the PRINT command if an appropriate queue has been set up.
If logical name LSL$PI448 is not defined, then a file LSL$PI448.DAT will be
created in the current directory.

.HL 1 ^^^*Use of ROVER\*
ROVER was originally designed for interactive use on colour graphics
screens. When used on a hardcopy plotter no attempt should be made
to clear parts of the picture, or to use the editing facilities.
The aim should be to produce the desired picture using the minimum
number of commands.
