.CHAPTER ^^^*Versatec electrostatic plotters\*
.INDEX FPPVRSC2V1
.INDEX FPPVRSVGS
Versatec electrostatic plotters may be used by Laser-Scan programs FPPVRSC2V1
and FPPVRSVGS (package PLOTTING), ROVERVRSC2V1 (package TVES), and LITES2MOTIF
(package LITES2).

.HL 1 ^^^*Versatec library\*
There are two versions of FPP producing output suitable for Versatec plotters,
which use different libraries supplied by Versatec. In order to use them,
one must have obtained the appropriate library and associated data files
from Versatec, and the plotter itself must be have appropriate hardware
and firmware to plot the data formats produced by these libraries.
.P 0
FPPVRSC2V1 uses a library usually called "Versatec Random Enhanced" (the
object library itself is COL2V1.OLB). This library produces .RAN files,
which need to be further processed using the Versatec supplied utility
CRFOUT before being sent to the plotter. Further details are given below.
.P 0
FPPVRSVGS uses a library called "Versatec Graphics Software (VGS)" (the
object library itself is VGSC.OLB or VGSH.OLB). This library can produce
a variety of output formats, depending on the settings in a parameter file.
With this library, no separate utilities are needed to process the plot data.
Further details are given below.

.HL 1 ^^^*Colour table\*
The Versatec colour electrostatic plotters differ from normal
pen plotters in that the colours produced by a particular colour index
(from an FRT file, for instance) may be defined by the user. In this
respect, the plotter resembles a colour display terminal. The Laser-Scan
programs initially define the colours by reading a disc file on logical name
LSL$VERSATEC__COLOUR. The format of this file is the same as that used
for the VAXstation and Tektronix displays, and the same file may be used,
although it will probably be found that changes are necessary to get
the desired colours on the Versatec. Also white should not normally
be used on the Versatec, as it will be invisible against the white paper
background. FPP and LITES2 will use the colours defined by the file on logical
name LSL$VERSATEC__COLOUR for the plot, while ROVER always reads in
another table subsequently (LSL$LOOKUP:ROVER5.DAT by default, or others
by use of the PLANES command, or explicitly by use of the LUT command).
.P 0
An example colour table file is given in Appendix A.

.HL 1 ^^^*Area filling\*
The maximum number of points allowed in a filled
area is 8192 by default, but may be altered by defining logical name
LSL$FILL__POINTSMAX to be the desired number. Similarly, the maximum
number of times which a hatch line (for hatched fill) may cut the
polygon is 100 by default, but may be altered by defining logical name
LSL$FILL__CUTSMAX to be the desired number - exceeding this limit results
in the message 'FILL__SIDE - Too many intersections found - ignored'.

.HL 1 ^^^*Versatec model and other parameters\*
FPPVRSC2V1 by default assumes a model 3436 plotter is being used, whilst
for FPPVRSVGS, a model must always be specified in the parameter file.
Amongst other things, the default paper size and numbers of
nibs per inch are based on the model. Although FPP does not mind
plotting outside the paper size (as printed out after the IFF command
is given), the library will clip the data, so it is important to use
the correct model number.
If using FPPVRSC2V1, and you have a model other than a 3436,
then set logical name LSL$VERSATEC__MODEL to be its number e.g.
.BL
$ Define LSL$VERSATEC__MODEL 3444
.BL
Other parameters may be set similarly:
.BL
The logical name LSL$VERSATEC__MEMORY may be set to an integer to control
the amount of memory (in bytes) assumed to be present in the plotter. The
default is 5500000. If using FPPVRSVGS, the logical name is ignored - if
required them memory size should be set in the parameter file.
.BL
If logical name LSL$VERSATEC__MONO is defined (at all) then a plot suitable for
a monochrome plotter will be produced. All line work is done in black. In the
case the default model is an 8242. If using FPPVRSVGS, the logical name is
ignored - all plots are done in colour mode, but if a monochrome model is
selected in the parameter file, then a monochrome plot is produced.
.BL
If logical name LSL$VERSATEC__MENU is defined (at all), then a menu of options
is displayed when the plot file is initialised. It may be possible to change
other parameters using this menu - though it is not guaranteed that the program
will plot correctly if this is done. If using FPPVRSVGS, the logical name is
ignored.
.BL
If logical name LSL$VERSATEC__BACKGROUND is defined (at all) then plots of
raster data will plot pixels which have colour index 0 in colour 0 as defined
in the colour table. If the logical name is not defined, then these pixels
will not be plotted at all, and so will remain paper coloured.
If using FPPVRSC2V1, the logical name is
ignored - pixels with 0 value are never plotted.

.HL 1 ^^^*Paper size and pixel size\*
FPP always has the concept of a sheet, in which it positions the plot according
to the commands given by the user. On the Versatec, the sheet size is based on
the Versatec model in use (as described above). The maximum Y dimension is the
width of the plotter, while the maximum X dimension is usually the same, giving
a square area. It is normally advisable to use FPP plot position 0, 1 or 2
(POSITION command) to avoid wastage of paper.
.P 0
ROVER always fills the whole sheet, which is assumed to consist of 1448 pixels
in the x direction, and an appropriate number in the y direction to give square
pixels. Since this may produce a plot which is too large, a means is provided
to change the sheet size, and the number of pixels.
.P 0
If you wish to set the paper size to be something other than the default,
perhaps longer along the roll of paper, or to acheive different positioning
using the POSITION command, then logical name LSL$VERSATEC__SIZE may be
set to to point to a file containing
a single line with 4 real numbers defining the x size (metres), y size
(metres), x number of pixels, and y number of pixels, for instance
to specify an A0 sheet, the file would have the single line:
.BR
1.189 0.841 1448 1024
.BR
The pixel numbers are not relevant to FPP, but control the number of
pixels assumed to cover the area for ROVER and LITES2. LITES2 sets
the number of pixels and their size itself, but will never draw more than
the specified number of pixels across a plot. The number may be altered
within LITES2 using the PLOT PIXELS command.
.P 0
The maximum number of pixels which may be specified in either direction
is 16384. Programs may impose other limits of their own e.g_.
10000 for ROVER. The limit for LITES2 depends on the format of the raster data.
For DTI files, the limit is
32768 for byte data, 16384 for word data, and 8192 for long data. There is no
limit for LSI or LSR format files. All of these limits (except ROVER's
10000) are proportional to the maximum number of points in filled areas
and hence may be increased using logical name LSL$FILL__POINTSMAX. The values
given here are for the default of 8192.
.P 0
If using FPPVRSVGS, then the paper size specified in the file will be
overridden by any size specified in the parameter file. (Note that if
PAPER is specified in the parameter file, the size must be in cm.)

.HL 1 ^^^*Versatec specific plotting\*
The VRSC2V1 Versatec driver can only plot in transparent mode, which
means that where parts of the plot overlap, the inks will be combined,
generally giving darker colours. The VRSVGS driver also has the ability to
plot in opaque mode, where anything drawn replaces what is there already
(underlying colours do not show through), but only if RASTER or VCGL output
formats are used. The following is only relevant in this case.
.P 0
Several mechanisms are provided to select the drawing mode, to satisfy the
needs of the programs FPP, ROVER, and LITES2.
.LIST "o"
.LE
By default FPPVRSVGS plots in transparent mode. The command ESCAPE 1 will
cause opaque mode to be used for subsequent plotting, while ESCAPE 2 will
revert to transparent mode. As an alternative, giving the command WORKSTATION
1000 before beginning a plot will select opaque mode initially.
.LE
By default, ROVERVRSVGS draws the vector overlay using opaque mode, so that
the colours replace any underlying colour. In order to allow the overlay to
be transparent, define the logical name LSL$VERSATEC__TRANSPARENT (as anything).
.LE
By default, LITES2 will draw any data in overlays whose base plane is greater
than zero in opaque mode. If it is required to draw everything in transparent
mode, then either define the logical name LSL$VERSATEC__TRANSPARENT (as
anything), or give the command PLOT TYPE 1000 (before PLOT OPEN). Any number
other than 1000 will revert to the original behaviour.
.P 0;As an alternative to the above mechanisms, the PLOT ESCAPE command may
be used, in the same way as for FPPVRSVGS. The command PLOT ESCAPE 1 will
switch to opaque plotting, while PLOT ESCAPE 2 will revert to transparent
plotting.
.END LIST
.P 0
A Versatec colour electrostatic plotter usually has four coloured toners,
yellow, magenta, cyan, and black. Any dot on the paper is either toned, or
left blank - the toners cannot be applied at less than full intensity.
This means that colours which are not fully saturated can only be acheived
using a screen pattern with some dots on and some dots off. The particular
screen pattern used is chosen by the Versatec library. These patterns are
used for filled areas and thick lines. For the thinnest lines, the screen
pattern sometimes produces a poor effect, because the line may lie
entirely in a gap in the pattern. For this reason, thin lines are drawn
in the nearest pure colour (yellow, magenta, cyan, red, green, blue, black,
white) to the desired colour.
.P 0;FPPVRSC2V1 draws lines in 8 different widths ranging
from 1 to 16 nibs (i.e_. up to 1mm on a 400dpi plotter), while FPPVRSVGS uses
31 different widths ranging from 1 to 31 nibs (i.e_. up to 2mm on a 400dpi
plotter).
.HL 1 ^^^*Producing plots\*
FPPVRSC2V1 produces Versatec Random Format output. By default this will go to a
file RANDOM.RAN in the current directory, but logical name RANDOM may be set to
point to another file name. The directory containing the Versatec colour and
pattern files (these have names like CE3400.DAT and CE3400.PAT) must be pointed
to by logical name LSL$LOOKUP. 
.P 0
The method used to plot the Random Format file depends on the Versatec
installation. The colour and pattern files mentioned above, and also any
device drivers and programs to send the Random Format file to the
plotter, must be obtained from Versatec. These are not supplied by
Laser-Scan. The procedure is usually something like the following:
.PAGE
.P 0;
To produce an OFFLINE plot the following should be typed
.KEEP
.NOFILL

$ Define RANDOM 'filename'
Then run FPP to produce Random Format output in 'filename'

$ Define VEROUT 'filename'
$ Define VREMOTE DUMMY
$ Define VRECL 2000
$ Run CRFOUT (supplied by Versatec, reads RANDOM, writes VEROUT)

.NOKEEP
.FILL
The resulting VEROUT file can then be copied to a foreign mounted 
magnetic tape for use on an offline plotter.
.P 0;
To produce an ONLINE plot the following should be typed
.KEEP
.NOFILL

$ Define RANDOM 'filename'
Then run FPP to produce Random Format output in 'filename'

$ Define VEROUT 'filename'
$ Run CRFOUT (supplied by Versatec, reads RANDOM, writes VEROUT)

NB: The logical names VREMOTE and VRECL should be deassigned when producing an 
online plot for the versatec.

.NOKEEP
.FILL
The resulting VEROUT file can then be copied or printed to an online
Versatec plotter.
.P 0
FPPVRSVGS can produce any of three output formats, RASTER, VRF, or VCGL. All
the files required at run time are pointed to by logical names, which are
usually assigned by executing a command file VGSLOGNAM.COM or VGSSYSLOGNAM.COM
which is generated during installation of the VGS library software. The
parameter file, pointed at by logical name PRMFIL, must at least specify which
output driver, and which plotter model to use. Many other items may optionally
be specified. See the Versatec VGS User's Guide for details. If including a
PAPER directive in the parameter file, then ensure that it is specified in
centimetres. If possible, ensure that the Versatec test programs can be used to
produce plots before trying the Laser-Scan software. The output plot file uses
logical name VEROUT, which may be assigned to the actual plotter, or a disk
file depending on the plotter configuration. Note that incorrect settings in
the parameter file or the configuration file may well prevent FPPVRSVGS from
working. FPPVRSVGS expects to define pens and colours itself according to the
colour table on logical name LSL$VERSATEC__COLOUR, so do not attempt to define
these in the parameter file.
