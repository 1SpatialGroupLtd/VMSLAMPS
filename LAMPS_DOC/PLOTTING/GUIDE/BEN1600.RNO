.INDEX FPPBEN1600
.INDEX FPPBEN
.INDEX FPPHCBS
The image FPPBEN1600.EXE produces output suitable for Benson 1600
series pen plotters. Image FPPBEN is in use at some sites. This
uses an older plotter data format. FPPHCBS may be used with shareable
images HCBSBEN or HCBSBEN1600 to produce output equivalent to FPPBEN and
FPPBEN1600.

.HL 1 ^^^*Paper size
FPP always has the concept of a sheet, in which it positions the plot
according to the command given by the user. On the Benson, the sheet
is assumed to be 1.189x0.841 metres (A0 size). The initial pen position
(the origin) should be at the lower right of the plotter when standing
in front of it (minimum x, minimum y). The older FPPBEN program requires
the initial pen position to be at the lower left of the plotter when standing
in front of it (minimum x, maximum y).
It is normally
advisable to use FPP plot position 0, 1 or 2 (POSITION command) to avoid
wastage of paper.

.P 0
The default behaviour of the program is to assume that the plotter is
roll fed, and to advance to clean paper after a plot. If sheet feed is
used, the WORKSTATION 101 command should be given before the map is
plotted. After the plot, the pen will the return to the origin.
The default behaviour is WORKSTATION 100 (102 for FPPBEN).
.P 0
The full specification of the workstation type given in a WORKSTATION
command is: 100 - origin at min x, min y (right hand side of plotter),
return there after plot.
To this add 1 to cause the paper to advance after a plot, and 2 if
the initial origin is at max x, min y (left hand side of plotter).
The latter option is useful on any models of plotter which leave
the pen at the left hand side when initialised.

.HL 1 ^^^*Plotter interface\*
The plotter will be connected to the computer by a serial line. The baud
rate is normally set to 9600 since there is probably nothing to be gained
by higher rates. The only other non-default characteristics which
are normally set are /NOTYPEAHEAD/NOBROADCAST.

.HL 1 ^^^*Producing plots\*
The program sends its output to logical name LSL$BENSON. This
may be assigned either directly to the plotter or to a disc file, thus
for example
.NOFILL
$ Define LSL$BENSON TXA0:
.FILL
This will send output directly to the plotter on serial line TXA0:, or
.NOFILL
$ Define LSL$BENSON BENSON.PLT
.FILL
This will send output to the disc file BENSON.PLT in the current
directory. The file may subsequently be plotted by
.NOFILL
$ COPY BENSON.PLT TXA0: (assuming plotter is on TXA0:)
.FILL
If desired, the plotter may be set as a spooled device with an associated
print queue. Another common approach to ensure that only one user attempts
to access the plotter simultaneously is to run all plot jobs in a batch
queue with a job limit of 1. Note that output from the older FPPBEN
program cannot be sent to a file.
