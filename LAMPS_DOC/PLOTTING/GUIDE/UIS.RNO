.CHAPTER ^^^*VAXstation display (UIS)\*
.INDEX FPPUIS
The image FPPUIS.EXE produces output on a VAXstation screen, or optionally
creates a UIS file for subsequent display on a variety of devices. Note
that DEC workstations are more likely to be running DECWindows than the
older UIS software for which this chapter is relevant. See the
"X-Windows display (MOTIF)" chapter if running DECWindows.

.HL 1 ^^^*Display\*
FPPUIS may be run from a terminal emulating window on the VAXstation screen, or
from a separate terminal. The graphics display appears in a window on the
VAXstation screen, which is accessed on logical name SYS$WORKSTATION (which is
normally set up system wide). 
.P 0
On an 8 plane system, colours 0-63 may be used for the plot (0 is the
background).
.P 0
On a 4 plane system, colours 0-7 may be used for the plot.
.P 0
On a monochrome system, only colours 0 and 1 are available. In all cases,
features specified with colours out of range will be drawn in colour 1.
.P 0
The number of colours used may be modified to some extent by the use
of the WORKSTATION command.
.BR
WORKSTATION 6000 is relevant only to the 8 plane system, and allows
the user to define 128 rather than 64 colours.
.BR
WORKSTATION 7000 is relevant to both 4 and 8 plane systems. The
number of colours used is then allowed to reach the maximum for the
particular number of planes (16 and 256 respectively), the defaults being
16 and 250. The choice of 250 colours on an 8 plane system allows FPP
to run concurrently with any terminal emulation windows on the screen
without any contention over the colours. If logical name LSL$UIS__MAX__COLOUR
is defined to be an integer, then this number of colours will be used
instead. This could be used for example to use the full 256 colours, even
though this will then result in contention with any terminal windows.

.HL 1 ^^^*Colour table\*
The colours used for the picture are defined using a text file on logical name
LSL$VAX__COLOUR (if this is set up). See Appendix A for the format of this
file.

.HL 1 ^^^*Control options\*
Two logical names are available to control the way in which drawing
on the UIS workstation takes place.
.P 0
If logical name LSL$UIS__HW__FILL is defined (as anything), then the hardware
area filling facilities are used for solid fill areas (by default, close
horizontal hatch lines generated by the software are used). Hardware filling
may well be faster than the software fill. Hardware fill may be of particular
benefit if a UIS metafile is being created (see below), since it will take
advantage of the filling facilities of the final output device. Filled areas
are limited to 8192 points by default.
The limit may be altered by defining logical name
LSL$FILL__POINTSMAX to be the desired number. Similarly, the maximum
number of times which a hatch line (for software fill) may cut the
polygon is 100 by default, but may be altered by defining logical name
LSL$FILL__CUTSMAX to be the desired number - exceeding this limit results
in the message 'FILL__SIDE - Too many intersections found - ignored'.
correctly. Hardware fill may well be limited to a smaller number.
.P 0
Logical name LSL$UIS__RESOLUTION may be set to a line width in mm (the
default is 0.3, or approximately one pixel). This width will be used for
lines with zero width in the FRT, and will be the thickness and separation of
hatch lines in solid filled areas if hardware fill is not used. The main
purpose of this is that lines with a width less than the screen resolution
may be specified if output is to a UIS metafile for final output on a
different device.

.HL 1 ^^^*UIS plot files\*
In order to produce a UIS plot file, you have to set the logical name
LSL$UIS__RETAIN__FILENAME - this is the name of the file which will contain 
the UIS commands (i.e_. the metafile).
.P 0
It is important that this logical-name is cleared when UIS output-to-file
is complete because display-lists have to be enabled which can have 
unpleasant side-effects on other programs using UIS.
.P 0
(NB. A useful VMS utility which operates on UIS files is RENDER - it can 
translate the UIS commands into several formats eg. SIXEL, PostScript etc -
see "MicroVMS WORKSTATION SOFTWARE" manual.)
