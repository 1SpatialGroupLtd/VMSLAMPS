.HL 1 ^&CONTENT\&
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software
package PLOTTING. This package provides output to hardcopy plotting
devices The main component of the package is the Fast Plotter Program
FPP which is made up of three or sometimes four parts. 
.LIST
.LE
A specific FPP main program for each type of plotter supported eg
FPPCAL5800.EXE for Calcomp 5800 series electrostatic plotters. 
.LE
A single FPP shared image containing the bulk of the application code
(FPPSHR.EXE).
.LE
Specific shared libraries for each type of plotter supported, called 
GKSxxxSHR.EXE, where xxx is the device type e.g. LP for Laserplot).
.LE
Devices bearing a family resemblance to a Calcomp pen plotter, usually
support a version of the CalComp Host Computer Basic Software (HCBS).
For these plotters,  a single GKSHCBSSHR.EXE is used which in turn calls
upon further shared images. These are named HCBSyyy.EXE where yyy is eg
CAL907 for plotters with Calcomp 907 controllers. 
.END LIST

Details of FPP functionality and commands can be found in HELP within
FPP, and in the latest edition of the FPP Reference Manual. 
.BR
Details of feature representation can be found in the "FRT User Guide"
in the documentation for the MAPPING package.

.P 0
This document covers changes to package PLOTTING since the previous
general release of LAMPS software, which was frozen ready for issue 
in August 1990. At that time, the extant version of FPP was V2.9 of
03-Aug-1990. See the PLOTTING release notes for the previous LAMPS
release for information about earlier changes. 


.HL 1 ^&NEW#OR#CHANGED#FACILITIES\&
In the specified versions of the PLOTTING package programs, shared
libraries, or documentation, the following changes were made: 

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LU,")"

.LE
14-Aug-1990 - PRIM2RASTER.EXE
.LIST
.LE; PRIM2RASTER attempts not to miss out thin horizontal line occasionally.
New qualifiers /LPI (lines per inch) and /LPMM (lines per mm) provide
alternative methods for setting the resolution which may be more convenient
than /RESOLUTION. The specified resolution is now adjusted to the nearest
supported by the output format (e.g. for Hell MDP an integer number of lines
per cm.). Extra blank scan lines are no longer output at the top of the raster
to round to a whole number of swathes, thus the number of scan lines is now
exactly that computed based on the range, border, and resolution.
.P 0
The following changes have been made to the PRIM2RASTER User Guide which is
now Issue 1.2 -
.P 0
Three qualifiers are provided to set the resolution of the raster data
(/LPI, /LPMM, and /RESOLUTION). Whichever of these is most convenient
should be used. The specified resolution will be adjusted to the nearest
number actually supported by the chosen format, for example Hell MDP
only supports resolutions which are an integer number of lines per cm.
.P 0
.LM +10
.p-10;/LPI=real

.LM -10

.END LIST 0

.LE
30-Aug-1990 - GKSBENOFF3000SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; New version of shareable image used by FPPBENOFF3000 corrects problems
with tone fill, and writes to magnetic tape on logical name GPRV$OUTPUT
rather than MFA0.
.END LIST 0

.LE
 5-Sep-1990 - PRIM2RASTER.EXE
.LIST
.LE; TDP format - put the bytes in the 'run-count' at the start of each
scan line the VAX way round, rather than reversing them.
.END LIST 0

.LE
 5-Oct-1990 - GKSKONGSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Allow FPPKONG to write tape in EBCDIC, with a linefeed after each '@'
record delimiter. By default still writes ASCII - to get EBCDIC, define the
logical name LSL$KONGSBERG__EBCDIC to be any string.
.END LIST 0

.LE
13-Nov-1990 - GKSUISSHR.EXE (affects FPPUIS)
.LIST
.LE; New logical name LSL$UIS__HW__FILL. If defined then hardware area fill
facilities are used, rather than close horizontal hatching, for solid fill
areas. This should not affect the screen appearance (it may however be
faster), but may be of benefit if logical name LSL$UIS__RETAIN__FILENAME is
used to produce a UIS metafile, which is then RENDERed to some other
format (e.g_. Postscript), since the area fill facilities of the final
destination device will then be used. Note that the hardware fill areas
are at present never clipped, regardless of the use of the CLIP command.
.LE; New logical name LSL$UIS__RESOLUTION may be set to a real value (in mm)
which will be used as the line thickness for any features with width 0.0 in
the FRT file, and will also be used as the line thickness and separation in
software filled solid areas. The default is 0.3mm (approx 1 pixel). The main
benefit is again if a UIS metafile is being produced, since line widths less
than the default of 1 pixel may then be desirable.
.END LIST 0

.LE
13-Nov-1990 - PRIM2RASTER.EXE
.LIST
.LE; /MEMORY now defaults to 90_% of user's WSEXTENT, rather than 10MB,
and values which would exceed the user's quotas are automatically reduced. The
qualifier now accept a real value, rather than an integer number of megabytes.
.LE; If /BLOCKSIZE=0 is specified, then the blocksize is determined
automatically by making an extra pass through the data. This may cause
the running time of the program to almost double.
.LE; Allow /BORDER=0.0 - previously this value was inadvertently forbidden.
.LE; New PRIM2RASTER User Guide gives more details of these changes.
.END LIST 0

.LE
14-Nov-1990 - GKSPRIMSHR.EXE (affects FPPPRIM)
.LIST
.LE; Clipping is now supported if enabled by the +CLIP command. Note
that the clip limits default to the range of the file, but can be altered using
WINDOW. Previously all detail was output regardless of the CLIP command. Note
that at present, clipping of solid fill areas is not very sophisticated - the
result will not be correct if the area re-enters the clipping bounds on a
different side to that on which it left.
.LE; The CP entry in the primitive IFF output file was previously
not what was intended (only two distinct corners were specified). This
has now been fixed.
.LE; Line widths in the range 1-99 microns are now set correctly in the
TH entry of the _.PRIM file. Previously 0 was entered, which implied
single pixel thickness in PRIM2RASTER.
.LE; Avoid area features being drawn with the wrong colour (and thickness
if hatched) - the current attributes for line features were used.
.LE; Avoid incorrect _.PRIM file being produced if more than one IFF file
is plotted by FPPPRIM. Also allow more than one _.PRIM file to be produced
in the same run if the WORKSTATION command is used to close and re-open
the output (n.b. the filenames will be that of the last IFF file drawn before
the WORKSTATION command was issued).

15-Nov-1990 - PLOTTERS User Guide, Issue 1.9
.LIST
.LE; New PLOTTERS User Guide documents the above changes to FPPUIS and FPPPRIM.
.END LIST 0

.LE
10-Dec-1990 - GKSCAL5800SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; New version of this shareable image supports hardcopy plotting using
LITES2. It does not affect the use of FPPCAL5800.
.END LIST 0

.LE
10-Dec-1990 - GKSVRSC2V1SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; New version of this shareable image supports hardcopy plotting using
LITES2. Some minor changes may be noticeable in FPPVRSC2V1, and are documented
in the PLOTTERS User Guide, in particular:
.P 0;The default paper size is now that set by the Versatec library for
each model of plotter - this is usually a square with side equal to the
paper width. In previous versions, the length was increaed in proportion
to the shape of A0 paper. Users wishing to use a different area of paper
can still specify this in the LSL$VERSATEC__SIZE file.
.P 0;The colours for linework were previously set up differently from the
colours for filled areas - this sometimes caused strange effects for pale
colours. Now linework uses the same screen patterns to acheive colour as
filled areas, except for thin, single pixel lines which always use the
nearest pure colour (black, yellow, magenta, cyan, red, green, blue, white),
to avoid dash effects due to interaction with the screen patters.
.P 0;Note that, as before, lines are drawn in 8 different widths ranging
from 1 to 16 nibs (i.e_. up to 1mm on a 400dpi plotter).

.LE
10-Dec-1990 - PLOTTERS User Guide, Issue 1.10
.LIST
.LE; New PLOTTERS User Guide documents the above changes to FPPVRSC2V1.
.END LIST 0

.LE
13-Dec-1990 - PRIM2RASTER.EXE
.LIST
.LE; New version corrects problem whereby any scan line consisting entirely
of a non-background colour (e.g. a grid line across the plot) was duplicated
in all subsequent swathes.
.END LIST 0

.LE
 3-Jan-1991 - HCBSCAL907.EXE, HCBSCAL906.EXE, HCBSCALAIDU.EXE
.LIST
.LE; These shareable images for the production of plots on various Calcomp
pen plotters have been amended mainly for the benefit of plotting from
within LITES2. The plot file is now closed when a plot is completed
(i.e_. a PLOT CLOSE command is given in LITES2, or a WORKSTATION command
in FPP). Subsequent plots will create new files. Previously, the file
was only closed on image exit, which for LITES2 meant that the plot file
could not be sent to the plotter immediately, and that multiple plots were
all sent to the same file. If plotting online, then the plotter was not
relinquished until image exit, which prevented others from using it.
.END LIST 0

.LE
 3-Jan-1991 - FPPVRSVGS.EXE, GKSVRSVGSSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; This executable image and shareable GKS image provide a new version of
FPP for Versatec plotters using the new Versatec VGS library. This is more
versatile than the older COL2V1 library (used by FPPVRSC2V1), but the
customer site must have the library and associated data files to match
the FPP version in use. See the Versatec chapter of the PLOTTERS User Guide
for details of both the Versatec versions of FPP. The GKS shareable image
may be used for Versatec plotting from within LITES2.
.END LIST 0

.LE
 3-Jan-1991 - FPPMOTIF.EXE, GKSMOTIFSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; This executable image and shareable GKS image provide a new version of
FPP for X-windows displays running the MOTIF window manager. Versions of
FPP for screen displays are usually used for trial plots before sending
a final plot to a hardcopy plotter using another FPP version.
See the MOTIF chapter of the PLOTTERS User Guide
for details of this FPP version.
.END LIST 0

.LE
 3-Jan-1991 - PLOTTERS User Guide, Issue 1.11
.LIST
.LE; New PLOTTERS User Guide documents the the VRSVGS version of FPP in the
Versatec chapter, and includes a new chapter documenting the MOTIF version.
.END LIST 0

.LE
11-Jan-1991 - GKSCAL5800SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; This is a patched version of the previous release. It fixes a problem
in LITES2 hardcopy output whereby the 2nd and subsequent plots lost most
solid filled areas. A side effect of the change is that smaller (4x4) dots
area used to tone solid areas. This means that only 16 intensities of each
of the plotter's toners are possible, rather than 256 as previously. A future
release will use a logical name to control the dot size.

.END LIST 0

.LE
31-Jan-1991 - GKSCAL5800SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; As mentioned in the previous item, this release now uses 4x4 dot patterns
to tone solid areas by default (rather than 8x8). This means that the
dots are now smaller, but that only 16 gradations of each toner are available
rather than 64. A new logical name LSL$CALCOMP__DOTSIZE may be defined to be
an integer (2, 4, 8, or 16) to specify alternative dot sizes.
.LE; The colours for linework have always used 4 gradations of each toner
to acheive the desired colour. For pale colours, the line could fail to
appear at all. This release attempts to ensure that such lines appear in a
pale shade of the nearest colour available.
.LE; A problem has been fixed whereby the second and subsequent plots produced
in the same program run (this was more likely to apply to LITES2 than FPP)
failed to define some colours, with the result that features in these colours
were not plotted.
.LE; Solid filled areas are now clipped correctly at the boundary of the
plotting area if clipping is enabled. Previously the clipping was only
correct if the area left and re-entered the same side of the area.

.END LIST 0

.LE
31-Jan-1991 - GKSVRSVGSSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; This release does not by default plot pixels in images which have value
zero - they are left paper coloured. This had always been the behaviour of
GKSVRSC2V1SHR in any case. If it is desired to plot these pixels (in colour
0 as defined in the lookup table), then logical name LSL$VERSATEC__BACKGROUND
should be defined (as anything).
.LE; Solid filled areas are now clipped correctly at the boundary of the
plotting area if clipping is enabled. Previously the clipping was only
correct if the area left and re-entered the same side of the area.

.END LIST 0

.LE
31-Jan-1991 - GKSVRSC2V1SHR,GKSBEN3000SHR,GKSPI448SHR,GKSUISSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Solid filled areas are now clipped correctly at the boundary of the
plotting area if clipping is enabled. Previously the clipping was only
correct if the area left and re-entered the same side of the area.
In the case of GKSUISLIB, hardware fill is only used if logical name
LSL$UIS__HW__FILL is defined - software filled areas were clipped
correctly in previous releases.

.END LIST 0

.LE
31-Jan-1991 - PLOTTERS User Guide, Issue 1.12
.LIST
.LE; New PLOTTERS User Guide documents changes to VRSVGS, CAL5800, and UIS.
.END LIST 0

.LE
7-Feb-1991 - GKSPRIMSHR.EXE,PRIM2RASTER.EXE
.LIST
.LE; New version of GKSPRIMSHR (for use by FPPPRIM) avoids putting duplicate
points into the primitive IFF file, and also now clips solid filled areas
correctly.

.LE; New version of PRIM2RASTER avoids division by zero error when there
is a duplicated point in a line feature in the _.PRIM file.
.END LIST 0

.LE
7-Feb-1991 - Colour table for plotters, and PLOTTERS User Guide, Issue 1.13 
(SPR 1067).
.LIST
.LE; An example colour table, intended mainly for use with electrostatic
plotters, is provided, along with an IFF file and other files needed to
demonstrate its use. Use of the table is explained in the Colour Table
Appendix to the Plotters User Guide.
.P 0
The new files supplied in LSL$PUBLIC__ROOT:[PLOTTING...] are:
.LM +3
[.LOOKUP]COLOUR__TABLE.COL - the colour table itself
.BR
[.COM]COLOUR__TABLE.COM - a command file to plot it
.BR
[.EXAMPLES.FRT]COLOUR__TABLE.FRT - FRT file required for plot
.BR
[.EXAMPLES.IFF]COLOUR__TABLE.IFF - plot IFF file
.BR
[.EXAMPLES.LCM]COLOUR__TABLE.LCM - colour table as LITES2 commands
.LM -3
.P 0
Since there has not been a [PLOTTING.LOOKUP] directory on LSL$PUBLIC__ROOT
before, the system manager should use the SEARCHLIST__TREE command file to
regenerate the definitions of the system logical names so that the LSL$LOOKUP
search list includes this directory.
.END LIST 0

.LE
8-Mar-1991 - FPP*.EXE, GKS_*SHR.EXE, HCBS_*.EXE (Version 3.0 of 22-Mar-1991)
.LIST
.LE
New release of whole FPP suite of programs. A new version (FPPPOSTSCRIPT)
is available,
which produces output using the Adobe PostScript page description language.
FPPGWS and the associated GKSGWSSHR are no longer supported, since they
were not in use, and did not seem likely to be used. FPPSHR.EXE, which contains
the device independent code, is linked with the new LSLFRTLIB (see MAPPING
Release Notes). The main changes resulting from this are that most of
the limits on FRT, SRI, and TRI files can be increased by defining logical
names of the form LSL$FRT__xyzMAX. Also new flag bits are provided, meaning
use hardware curve or text if possible, and also to maintain the phase of
patterns through invisible segments. The spacing and thickness of hatch
lines in filled areas within symbols and texts is now correct, and these
areas may now include invisible segments in the SRI and TRI files. Note that
invisible segments will still be visible in a symbol used as part of a
pattern filled area when the flag bit indicating "clip to boundary of the
area" is used.
.LE
The hatch lines in filled areas now rotate if a ROTATE command is given.
Previously the hatching angle always remained the same. This fixes SPRs
632, 744, and 1084. Note that hatching in text characters and symbols does
not rotate to the angle of the particular text or symbol.
.LE
When labelling, features are now not relabelled after an invisible segment.
This could spoil the plotting of the actual feature, especially for area
features.
.LE
New command ESCAPE. This is used to communicate a device dependent operation
to the plotting hardware. See the particular Plotter User Guide for details.
The only uses of this command at present are in versions CAL5800, VRSVGS,
BEN3000, and PI448. In these versions, ESCAPE 1 means use opaque drawing
mode, while ESCAPE 2 means use transparent mode. The mode may be switched
between successive plotting operations. The Plotters User Guide previously
documented WORKSTATION 1000 as causing CAL5800 to use opaque mode. This never
worked - the Calcomp is incapable of drawing every item opaque. A similar
facility is now provided by ESCAPE. This fixes SPR 1108.
.LE
Three of the small driver images (FPP_*.EXE) are released. These indicate
to FPPSHR what hardware facilities are available. FPPAEG now allows hardware
curves, while FPPHCBS and FPPTEK__ARGS allow hardware text (if the FRT flag
bit is set). FPPHRD (which does not use shareable images) also allows
hardware text.
.LE
All of the GKS shareable images (GKS_*SHR.EXE) are released. They all now
allow rotation of hatching if the plot is rotated (this is not supported
by GKSSIG6000SHR, which uses hardware hatching). Some were also amended
for other reasons, which follow:
.LIST "o"
.LE
AEG supports hardware curves (SPR 845). Interpolation mode 7 (third order
parabolic) is used. Peck patterns which use a zero length major or minor
peck but with the non-zero component repeated cannot be plotted using the
hardware peck generator (the gaps are of unequal length), so they are plotted
using software. Previously they would have been drawn incorrectly using
hardware.
.LE
BEN3000, BENOFF3000, CAL5800, HCBS, LP, PI448, SIG6000, TEK__ARGS, UIS, VRSC2V1,
and VRSVGS support hardware text, though no attempt will be made to use it
except in the versions noted above (HCBS and TEK__ARGS). It could be tried
experimentally in the others by running FPPSHR itself after assigning logical
name LSL$GKSSHR to the appropriate image.
.LE
CAL5800 fixes a problem where if hatched areas were plotted before any
linework, then the pens were not defined, usually resulting in black lines
instead of coloured ones.
.LE
BEN3000, BENOFF3000, CAL5800, PI448, VRSC2V1, and VRSVGS support the new
ESCAPE command to set the drawing mode.
.LE
HP has been amended to close its plot file correctly, and also to ensure that
the plot file is selected before writing plot commands to it. These changes
will allow GKSHPSHR to be used by LITES2 for hardcopy plotting.
.END LIST
.LE
The eight Calcomp compatible shareable images (HCBS_*.EXE) are released. These
now include the HCBS routine SYMBOL, which draws hardware text. However, no
attempt will be made to use hardware text unless running FPPHCBS or FPPSHR
directly (e.g. FPPCAL907 will not use it).
.LE
New FPP.HLB help library, provides help on ESCAPE, and alters the help on
WORKSTATION slightly.
.LE
New HCBSSHARE.COM and HCBSTVEC.MAR examples now include the SYMBOL routine to
support hardware text. Thes are only relevant to anyone who has built their own
HCBS shareable image for a plotter not otherwise supported. Any existing HCBS
shareable images will still work provided that hardware text is not used. To
use hardware text, they should be re-linked using these example files. Note
that the arguments passed to SYMBOL are of the following form:
.P 0
.NOFILL
.KEEP
CALL SYMBOL( real XP, real YP, real HEIGHT,
             character_*(_*) STR, unused integer 0,
