.HL 1 ^&CONTENT\&
This document describes some additional functionality for the Calcomp
5800 series plot driver, which could not be included in the main PLOTTING
release notes.

.P 0
This document is part of the LAMPS V4.0 release, which went into Alpha test in
May 1992.

.HL 1 ^&NEW#OR#CHANGED#FACILITIES\&
In the specified versions of the PLOTTING package programs, shared
libraries, or documentation, the following changes were made:

FPPCAL5800 has been enhanced to allow thicker lines and to use different join
and cap styles. Previously lines used the Calcomp's hardware thick lines, which
could only be up to 16 'nibs' wide (approx 1mm on a 400 d.p.i_. plotter, and
always had ends which were squared off parallel to the sides of the paper. By
default, the new version still uses these for lines up to 16 'nibs', but for
thicker lines switches to software thick lines (using area fill). Logical name
LSL$CALCOMP__HWTHK may be set to be an integer, denoting the maximum width in
nibs for which hardware lines will be used, thus 0 always uses software lines,
while a large number will always use hardware lines. The default is 16.
.P 0
For software thick lines, the setting of the hardware field in the FRT is used
to indicate what style of line caps and joins are required. The CAP style is a
number in the range 0-2. 0 means butt caps (square ends), 1 means round caps,
and 2 means extended caps (square but extended by half the line thickness. The
JOIN style is also a number in the range 0-2. 0 means mitre joins (the sides of
the thick lines extended to meet), 1 means round joins, and 3 means bevel joins
(each segment has a square end, but the missing triangle is filled in). Mitre
joins are changed to bevel if the resulting spike would be 'too long' - this is
taken to be when there is an acute corner in the line with an angle of less
than about 11 degrees. Closed line features will use the join style at the
start/end point, and will not have a cap at all. The FRT hardware field is
built up as 10_*JOIN#_+#CAP, so for instance 21 would mean JOIN = 2 = extended,
CAP = 1 = round. If omitted, the hardware field defaults to 0, meaning mitre
joins and butt caps. Remember that the hardware field in the SCT entry (if
present) will override that in the FRT.
.P 0
Software thick lines use Calcomp area fill to fill each line segment. A side
effect of this is that the area colour is used. The colours of hardware thick
lines are not as versatile, and sometimes have difficulty in producing the same
colour as for areas of the same colour index. This has sometimes led to
unexpected colour changes in solid area fill when the maximum number of points
for hardware fill is reached, and close hatching is used instead. Using
software thick lines throughout (LSL$CALCOMP__HWTHK set to 0) may well avoid
this problem. Very thin lines may produce unexpected effects if the area
colours are used, such as if a 1 nib horizontal or vertical line completely
misses the toned dots in the area pattern. To avoid this, either give all lines
a sensible thickness in the FRT (rather than 0), or define LSL$CALCOMP__HWTHK
to a number such as 3, so that the thinnest lines still use hardware lines.
.P 0
Note that the use of software thick lines is likely to increase the plot file
size by a factor of around 4, and so it should only be used if high quality
thick lines are essential.
.LE
A new logical name LSL$CALCOMP__DPI is provided to specify the resolution of
the plotter in dots per inch. The logical name should be defined to be a real
value, the default being 400. This is used to select the correct thickness for
hardware thick lines, which is specified in terms of the resolution.
