.HL 1 ^&CONTENT\&
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan LAMPS software
package PLOTTING. This package provides output to hardcopy plotting
devices The main component of the package is the Fast Plotter Program
FPP which is made up of three or sometimes four parts. 
.LIST
.LE
A specific FPP main program for each type of plotter supported eg
FPPCAL5800.EXE for Calcomp 5800 series electrostatic plotters. 
.LE
A single FPP shared image containing the bulk of the application code
(FPPSHR.EXE).
.LE
Specific shared libraries for each type of plotter supported, called 
GKSxxxSHR.EXE, where xxx is the device type e.g. LP for Laserplot).
.LE
Devices bearing a family resemblance to a Calcomp pen plotter, usually
support a version of the CalComp Host Computer Basic Software (HCBS).
For these plotters,  a single GKSHCBSSHR.EXE is used which in turn calls
upon further shared images. These are named HCBSyyy.EXE where yyy is eg
CAL907 for plotters with Calcomp 907 controllers. 
.END LIST

Details of FPP functionality and commands can be found in HELP within
FPP, and in the latest edition of the FPP Reference Manual. 
.BR
Details of feature representation can be found in the "FRT User Guide"
in the documentation for the MAPPING package.

This document covers changes to package PLOTTING since the previous
general release of LAMPS software, which was frozen ready for issue 
in April 1991.  At that time, the extant version of FPP was V3.0 of
22-Mar-1991. See the PLOTTING release notes for the previous LAMPS
release for information about earlier changes. 


.HL 1 ^&NEW#OR#CHANGED#FACILITIES\&
In the specified versions of the PLOTTING package programs, shared
libraries, or documentation, the following changes were made:

30-Apr-1991 - Release Notes
.list
.le; These release notes were trimmed back to the last release.
.end list 0
.LE
30-Apr-1991 - GKSAEGSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Put the G1 instruction on a line by itself when leaving G7 (curve
interpolation) mode. This is in order that different plotter models should
behave the same.
.END LIST 0

.LE
3-Jun-1991 - GKSPOSTSCRIPTSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Avoid problem with negative coordinates (probably off the paper
anyway) - E format notation including a space was used, which the PostScript
interpreter cannot understand.
.LE; Allow LSL$PS__SIGFIG to be 0-8 as documented - previously only 0-7
was allowed.
.END LIST 0

.LE
14-Jun-1991 - GKSAEGSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Add a D0 instruction on a line by itself when leaving G7 (curve
interpolation) mode. This is in order that different plotter models should
behave the same.
.LE; Leave pre/post exposure turned on all the time (previously was off
when tangential control was used). Corner exposure remains on only when
not using tangential control.
.END LIST 0

.LE
30-Jul-1991 - GKSBEN3000SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Avoid access violation when drawing hardware text. This problem was
unlikely to be encountered, since FPPBEN3000 does not allow hardware text.
(It was possible if FPPSHR was run directly.)
.END LIST 0

.LE
 1-Aug-1991 - FPPSHR.EXE/FPPHRD.EXE (V3.1)
.LIST
.LE; SPR 1287. Avoid access violation if e.g_. LABEL AC HEIGHT is given
before the FRT is specified. Note that only the default ACDs are available
until an FRT is given.
.LE; Draw curves with invisible segments correctly. Each visible bit is
now tested to see whether it forms a closed loop, and is drawn accordingly
(as in LITES2). Previously, only the first bit was tested, which could
result in subsequent bits being drawn as loops when they weren't, or
vice-versa.
.END LIST 0

.LE
11-Sep-1991 - GKSCAL5800SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; SPR 1307. Avoid traceback, and production of a bad plot file when solid
filled areas have more than 4095 points. This is the limit for Calcomp hardware
fill area. Solid areas with between 4096 and 8192 (the Laser-Scan limit) will
now use software fill (i.e_. close hatching) - note that this might not produce
exactly the same colour as hardware fill.
.END LIST 0

.LE
11-Sep-1991 - GKS(VRSC2V1,VRSVGS,BEN3000,BENOFF3000)SHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; The are released primarily because they use parts of the same library
as CAL5800 above. As far as is known, these are not restricted to 4095
point hardware fill areas, so the limit remains at 8192.
.END LIST 0

.LE
13-Sep-1991 - PRIM2RASTER.EXE, PRIM2RASTER User Guide V1.4
.LIST
.LE; SPR 964. MDP and TDP formats have been flipped in x - the first scan line
now starts at the top right of the plot, rather than top left.
.LE; New qualifier, /MIRROR, provided which flips the plots back to the
way they used to be.
.LE; SPR 1257. Avoid premature exit with OPBUFOVF (output buffer overflow)
error in the case that a scan line exactly filled up the output buffer.
.END LIST 0

.LE
19-Sep-1991 - GKSMOTIFSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; Avoid error if a bit image is zoomed by more than x32. GKSMOTIFSHR is
unlikely to be used to draw images, so this update is just to bring it up
to the latest version.
.END LIST 0

.LE
20-Sep-1991 - GKSPOSTSCRIPTSHR.EXE
.LIST
.LE; A version identifer, and also the username, are now written to the
'Creator' header comment of the PostSript output. This version is
V1.1 of 20-SEP-1991.
.LE; This release supports the drawing of images when used from within
LITES2. At present, images are drawn in grey scale, even if a colour output
device is used (though the use of an appropriate PostScript header file could
plot colour images). The level of grey is based on the lightness of the colour
specified in the colour table. Bit and byte images are encoded differently, and
both are run-length compressed by default. Logical name LSL$PS__COMPRESS may be
used to modify the behaviour. The PostScript chapter of the Plotters User Guide
has been amended to include details of images.
.LE; SPR 1294. More options controlling solid filled areas have been added.
Those with a number of points between the maximum path and 8192 now use
software hatching, rather than not being plotted properly at all. See the
PostScript chapter of the Plotters User Guide for details, especially of
logical names LSL$PS__HW__FILL and LSL$PS__FILL__INVIS.
.LE; Previous releases did not free the LUN used to read the header file if
LSL$PS__HEADER was defined. This resulted in failure after 20 plots had been
produced in the same program run.
.END LIST 0

.LE
22-Oct-1991 - Plotters User Guide Issue, 3.1
.LIST
.LE; Changes in the POSTSCRIPT and MOTIF chapters.
.LE; The BEN3000, CAL5800, PI448, and VERSATEC chapters have been corrected
to refer to ESCAPE 2 (rather than 0) to revert to transparent plotting. They
also now document the use of the new PLOT ESCAPE command when plotting from
within LITES2.
