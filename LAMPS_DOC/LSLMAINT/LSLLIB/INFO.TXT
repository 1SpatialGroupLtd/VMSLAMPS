The LSLLIB message definition program NEWMSG has been extensively upgraded, and
the complicated 'jacket' command file NEWMESSAGE is no longer required.

Chapter 3 of the LSLLIB documentation has been revised to reflect the changes,
and a summary is provided below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new program takes the message definition file as its input (default
SYS$DISK:[].MES), and its main qualifiers are:

/NUMBER=integer
- the facility number - this is required

/PARAMETERS=(type,...)
/NOPARAMETERS
- the parameter files to generate. The possible values are FORTRAN, MACRO32 and
  C, with /PARAMETER=FORTRAN being the default.

/RUNOFF
- requests the generation of a RUNOFF file - see below.

/DESTINATION=directory
- specifies where the parameter and runoff files are to be created. The default
  location is the current directory (SYS$DISK:[]).

/PREFIX=string
- specifies the facility prefix, if this is not to be the same as the file name
  of the message definition file.

/NAME = string
- specifies the facility name, if this is not to be the same as the file name
  of the message definition file.

The program is used as follows:

	$ NEWMSG  FRED.MES /NUMBER=1234/PARAM=(FORT,C)
	$ @FRED.TEMP_COM

where the temporary command file is created by NEWMSG, and does the running of
the MESSAGE utility and the compiling, linking and running of the FORTRAN
program that generates the parameter files. This command file also tidies up
after itself, including deleting itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that, although the program will accept standard message definition files,
it now expects that the EXPLANATION and USERACTION from the error message
descriptions will be in the file. This allows NEWMSG to generate a runoff file,
called 'name'MSG.RNO, for inclusion (via .REQUIRE) into the documentation. Some
small editing is needed, but nowhere near as much as typing the whole lot in
again! The new message format is thus:

<severity>  <spc>  <ident>  <gap>  \  <message>  \
EXPLANATION <gap>  \ <description> \
USERACTION  <gap>  \ <description> \

where <gap> (as before) is tabs, spaces and newlines, and <description> may be
several lines of text. These are copied directly to the .RNO file. To include
a backslash, type \\ (as usual).

For instance, the message description:

	ERROR  CONVERT  \%I4 errors during conversion\
	EXPLANATION
	\Some or all of the lines of the file to be converted were not in the
	correct format.\
	USERACTION
	\Check that all lines are in the ^*correct\\* form
	.blank
		_<severity_> _<type_> _<count_>
	.blank
	and edit those that are incorrect.\

will produce the runoff text:

	.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
	CONVERT, %I4 errors during conversion
	.JUSTIFY

	.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
	Some or all of the lines of the file to be converted were not in the
	correct format.
	.P0; ^*User action:\*
	Check that all lines are in the ^*correct\* form
	.blank
		_<severity_> _<type_> _<count_>
	.blank
	and edit those that are incorrect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The command file NEWMESSAGE has been replaced, and will now output a message
advising you to use the new NEWMSG program. It will tell you the qualifiers
that correspond to the call of NEWMESSAGE that you made (although generally
with more qualifiers than you need), and will then run NEWMSG for you, to
produce the correct result.
