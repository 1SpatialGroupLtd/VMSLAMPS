.P 0
The following routines are provided as a standard route for opening IFF
files. They have two purposes:

.LIST
.LE; to simplify the arguments required for opening an IFF file - the IFFLIB
routines IFFOPN and IFFOPI are over-complex to use
.LE; to standardise the messages output by programs which are opening
IFF files - all of the IMP utilities now use these routines to open their
IFF files
.END LIST 0

.P 0
It is assumed that the routines will normally be allowed to report their
own errors (with ^*report\* set to true). However, if the calling program
intends to use the return code from these routines, care should be taken
to supply the arguments required by several of the error codes. The IFF
filename is required by the messages LSL__IFFOPEN, LSL__IFFCREATE,
LSL__IFFMODIFY and LSL__IFFPARSE. The message LSL__IFFSIZE requires the
^*size\* argument to IFFCREATE as its argument.

IFFOPEN opens an IFF file for read (only).

.P 0
If the ^*fid\* argument is absent, then a call to IFFOPN is generated.
.BR
^*file\* is the name of the file to open, defaulting to "LSL$IF:IFF.IFF".
If ^*file\* does not have a version number, then the most recent version
of the file is opened. The default applied to the filename is "LSL$IF:IFF.IFF"

.P 0
If the ^*fid\* argument is present, then a call to IFFOPI is generated.
.BR
^*fid\* is the file ID obtained by a call of IFFID when the file was previously
opened, and ^*file\* should be the full filename as returned by a call of
IFFINQ at the same time.

.P 0
When the file has been succesfully opened, IFFRLA is called to switch
read-look-ahead on. If ^*report\* is present and TRUE, then a message of
the form

.P 5                            
LSLLIB-I-IFFOPENED, ^*file\* opened for read

.P 0
is output. If ^*report\* is absent, it defaults to FALSE, and no message
is output.

.P 0
If ^*revision\* is specified, then IFFIRV will be called after the file
has been opened, to set the input revision level. If ^*revision\* is not
specified, then the input revision level defaults to 0.

.P 0
The values returned in ^*ok\* are listed below. Note that if an error occurs,
the routine will report it itself.

IFFCREATE creates a new IFF file, and leaves it selected for write.

.P 0
^*file\* is the name of the file to open, defaulting to "LSL$IF:IFF.IFF".
Note that ^*file\* may not contain a version number (or a ";" at the end).

.P 0                   
If ^*history\* is present, then it may be up to 12 characters to be inserted
into the descriptive part of the first history record (in the HI entry), when
the file is closed by IFFCLO. If ^*history\* is absent, then it defaults to
'Create'. If the file as closed does not contain an HI entry, then this
argument has no effect. 

.P 0
If ^*size\* is present, then it is the required initial size of the IFF
file in words. If not present, then this defaults to 25,600 (ie 100 blocks
of 256 words each). Note that the file is truncated when closed by IFFCLO,
anyway.

.P 0
If ^*revision\* is present, then IFFORV will be called before the IFF file
is opened, to set the output revision level. If ^*revision\* is not
specified, then the value stored in the logical name LSL$IFF__OUTPUT__REVISION
will be used. If the logical name does not exist, then an output revision level
of zero is used.

.P 0
When the file is created, then if ^*report\* is present and TRUE, a message of
the form 

.P 10
LSLLIB-I-IFFOPENED, ^*file\* opened for write

.P 0
is output. If ^*report\* is absent, it defaults to FALSE, and no message
is output.

IFFMODIFY opens an existing IFF file, and leaves it selected for write.

If the ^*fid\* argument is absent, then a call to IFFOPN is generated.
In that case, the arguments are interpreted as follows:

.LM +5

.P 0
^*file\* is the name of the file to open, defaulting to "LSL$IF:IFF.IFF".
If ^*file\* does not have a version number, then the most recent version
of the file is opened.

.P 0
If ^*history\* is present, then it may be up to 12 characters to be inserted
into the descriptive part of the next history record (in the HI entry), when
the file is closed by IFFCLO. If ^*history\* is absent, then it defaults to
'Update'. If the file as closed does not contain an HI entry, then this
argument has no effect. 

.LM -5

.P 0
If the ^*fid\* argument is present, then a call to IFFOPI is generated.
In that case, the arguments are interpreted as follows:

.LM +5

^*fid\* is the file ID obtained by a call of IFFID when the file was previously
opened, and ^*file\* should be the full filename as returned by a call of
IFFINQ at the same time.

.P 0
If the ^*history\* argument is present, then a new history record will be
generated in the HI entry when IFFCLO is called, and ^*history\* will be
the annotation placed into that record. If the ^*history\* argument is absent,
then the old history record will be updated - the annotation will not be
changed.

When the file is opened then if ^*report\* is present and TRUE, a message of
the form 

.P 10
LSLLIB-I-IFFOPENED, ^*file\* opened for update

.P 0
is output. If ^*report\* is absent, it defaults to FALSE, and no message
is output.

.P 0
If ^*revision\* is specified, then IFFIRV will be called after the file
has been opened, to set the input revision level. If ^*revision\* is not
specified, then the input revision level defaults to 0.
