.TITLE LSLMAINT Release notes
.PAGE
.HL 1 ^*CONTENT\*
This document describes recent changes to the Laser-Scan software package
LSLMAINT. This package provides run time library support and system utilities
to create an environment which is assumed for development of 
Laser-Scan software. 
.P 0
This document is part of the LAMPS V4.4 release, which went into Alpha test in
May 1995. It covers changes to package LSLMAINT made since the previous
LAMPS  release (V4.3) which went into Alpha test in January 1994. See the
release notes for the previous LAMPS release for information about earlier
changes. 
.P 0
Note that LSLMAINT package is not usually shipped to customer sites, unless
there is an urgent need to carry out on-site development of LSL software.
.P 0
Note also, that the procedures, libraries and utilities are
supplied only to support LSL software development
and will not usually be used by customer staff.

.HL 1 ^*NEW OR CHANGED FACILITIES\*
The specified versions of the LSLMAINT package procedures, libraries and
programs had the following facilities added, implemented or their actions
altered.

.LE;Release Notes - 6-Jul-1994

.LIST
.LE
The Release Notes have been trimmed back to the last regular release.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB of 4-Jul-1994
.LIST
.LE
SPR 2725. Ensure that Display PostScript text is drawn on the screen ^*before\*
subsequent non-PostScript graphics. Because of the separate PostScript
pipeline, it was previously possible for PostScript text to appear later
than intended, causing problems when the display order was important (such
as using priorities).
.LE
Avoid unnecessarily getting the PostScript pipeline up to date if no
PostScript text has been drawn. This may give a slight performance
improvement if Display PostScript is enabled, but is not being heavily
used.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSHPGL2LIB.OLB of 18-Jul-1994
.LIST
.LE
Ensure that filled areas (especially clipped ones) return to their
starting point. Previously, the current pen position could be lost,
resulting in displacement of subsequent parts of the plot.
.LE
A 'TR0' instruction is now included in the HP-GL/2 output. This ensures
that white graphics are actually drawn. Previously, plotters would
default to drawing white 'transparently' (i.e_. not drawing it at all).
.LE
All pixels of bit images (including background) are now drawn, unless
LSL$HP__BACKGROUND is defined as 0, when they are left blank (also for
byte images).
.LE
The paper size (PS) instruction derived from an LSL$HP__SIZE file has
been corrected.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSAEGLIB, GKSFERLIB, GKSHPGL2LIB, GKSLDLIB, GKSLDLIB2, GKSSIGLIB,
GKSUISLIB.OLB of 1- and 2-Sep-1994
.LIST
.LE
Updated to provide support for arbitrary hatching angles in filled areas.
.LE
Prevent 3-point closed areas (i.e. a line) from reaching the FILL__SIDE
routine and producing the 'Bad argument list' error. Instead, 'GKS error
100 in routine GFA' will occur (wrong number of data points). Most
of the libraries do not bother to display this error.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 7-Sep-1994
.LIST
.LE
Same changes as in GKS_*.OLB above.
.LE
Add code to calculate a bounding polygon for a Display PostScript text.
This is called by the TRI__BOUND routine in FRTLIB when the LITES2's REGION
command is used on a hardware text.
.LE
Flush out changes to Display PostScript graphical context when the plane
mask is changed. This causes the PostScript text to only affect the
appropriate overlay. Previously it could obliterate data already drawn in
other overlays.
.LE
Alter the method of setting the colour of Display PostScript text. Previously
it was possible to get a colour consisting of 'dithering' between the
desired colour and the adjacent one in the colour table.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSPSLIB.OLB of 7-Sep-1994
.LIST
.LE
PS files now identified as produced by GKSPSLIB V2.2 7-September-1994.
.LE
Same changes as in GKS_*.OLB above.
.LE
Add code to calculate a bounding polygon for a PostScript text.
This is intended for future use if a blanking region around text becomes
part of the graphics drawn for the text.
.LE
Change the definitions of `u' and `U' in the prolog. The previous definitions
were not executed correctly by some PostScript interpreters which did not
conform exactly to the Adobe standard. The usual result was `stackoverflow'
or `typecheck' errors.
.LE
SPR 2796. Correct the code produced for compressed byte images (using the IM1
procedure). In some circumstances (for example rows which did not contain a
multiple of 8 pixels), invalid code was output which could result in an
`undefined' or `typecheck' error.
.LE
Correct the prolog code for monochrome compressed bit images (using the
IMM1 procedure). If colour was enabled (LSL$PS__COLORIMAGE defined as 1), and
the plot was sent to a device which supported colour images, then a
`rangecheck' error would result.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSCAL5800LIB.OLB of 22-Nov-1994
.LIST
.LE
Add GESC(1003,) to be called by ESCAPE 3 in LITES2/FPP. It creates a new
topmost transparent layer (c.f. ESCAPE 1 - new topmost opaque layer, and
ESCAPE 2 - revert to bottom transparent layer).
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 9-Dec-1994
.LIST
.LE
Improve the handling of copying reserved colours into a private colour
map. If the first free colour is in the top half of the default map,
then assume that the reserved colours are at the top, rather than
the bottom.
.LE
Assert the colour map for a window when it is created.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSCAL5800LIB.OLB of 19-Dec-1994
.LIST
.LE
Flush out software thick lines when clipping switched on/off by
GSCLIP. Previously, if clipping was enabled just before GCLWK,
then an attempt was made to use fill-area memory which had
not been allocated.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 23-Jan-1995
.LIST
.LE
Avoid possibility of hanging while using Display PostScript, by
disabling the event-handling in the X-event AST while calling
X, Xt, and DPS routines.
.END LIST 0

.LE;ADC__JACKET.COM of 27-Jan-1995
.LIST
.LE
This is a jacket command file around ADC which tests the system architecture
and if it is `VAX', the old ADC program is run as normal and if `Alpha', it
re-orders the command line arguments and ADCC__TV.EXE is called, with the
appropriate qualifiers.
.END LIST 0

.LE;LSLMAINTINI.COM of 30-Jan-1995
.LIST
.LE
Replaces the ADC symbol definition to point to `LSL$COM:ADC__JACKET.COM'
which in turn will run the old ADC program or the new ADCC__TV program
depending on the system architecture.

It also defines ADCC, PVV and MAPID to have suffixes of `_TV' when running
on the AXP platform.
.END LIST 0

.LE;ADCC.EXE of 27-Jan-1995
.LIST
.LE
ADC has been re-written in C and called ADCC.EXE so that it will work as a
translated image on the AXP platform. This has most of the functionality of
the original but the most significant difference is that of the command line
interface. The new program has the standard VAX command line consisting of
qualifiers and input arguments followed by the output file.

In order for programs which are to be compiled native to be modified with
minimal changes, a command file jacket has been put around ADC so that the
command line calls to ADC will need no alteration. To this end LSLMAINTINI
now defines the ADC symbol to point to 'LSL$COM:ADC__JACKET.COM'.
.END LIST 0

.LE;PVV.EXE of 30-Jan-1995
.LIST
.LE
PVV has been modified to be able to patch the IDENT from the ADC temporary
file, ADC.IDE, into the correct place of an AXP object module. AXP object files
containing multiple modules must have been created using the FORTRAN qualifier,
/SEPARATE__COMPILATION.
.END LIST 0

.LE;MAPID.EXE of 30-Jan-1995
.LIST
.LE
MAPID will now also read map listings produced on the AXP platform and create
the appropriate summary information in the .MAPID file.
.END LIST 0

.LE;_[LSLMAINT.COMMON.LSLGOTHICLIB_]_*.H of 24-Mar-1995
.LIST
.LE
Replacement `C' language header files to match the new LSLGOTHICSHR
image in the LSLSYSTEM package.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 4-Apr-1995
.LIST
.LE
Avoid attempting to install an invalid colour map on displays which
do not support user defined colours.
.LE
Add support for additional cursor shapes: circle, ellipse, square,
rectangle, and cross with centre missing.
.LE
Allow character names which include numbers in AFM files.
.LE
Add support for right-to-left PostScript fonts (for example Arabic,
or Hebrew), and also for substitution of different glyphs depending on
the position of a character within a word (Arabic).
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSPSLIB.OLB of 4-Apr-1995
.LIST
.LE

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 20-Apr-1995
.LIST
.LE
SPR 2963. Use C routine XCreateImage instead of Fortran binding X$CREATE__IMAGE,
since DEC have introduced a problem in the latter with Motif 1.2. This
could cause access violation in LSG__GET__IMAGE, as used by LITES2 raster
burn-in.
.LE
SPR 2964. Turn off overflow checking in more of the routines which calculate
INTEGER_*2 X pixel positions. This is just for safety, since the
overflow is probably harmless, yet is fatal on ALPHA/AXP. LITES2 has
in any case been changed to avoid the cause of the overflow.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 2-May-1995
.LIST
.LE
Add support for displays with pseudo-colour visual types with more
than 8 planes (e.g. 12). We have not yet seen a display which actually
provides 12 plane pseudo-colour.
.END LIST 0

.LE;GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB,GKSPSLIB.OLB of 12-May-1995
.LIST
.LE
Fix a problem introduced in the versions of 4-April-1995, whereby
regions around PostScript text strings omitted the last character.
