  LSLMAINT Release notes                                                    Page 2


  1  [1mCONTENT[0m

  This document describes  recent  changes  to  the  Laser-Scan  software  package
  LSLMAINT.   This  package provides run time library support and system utilities
  to create  an  environment  which  is  assumed  for  development  of  Laser-Scan
  software.

  This document covers the changes to package LSLMAINT since  the  previous  LAMPS
  release (V5.1) which went into Alpha test in August 1999.  See the release notes
  for the previous LAMPS release for information about earlier changes.

  Note that LSLMAINT package is not usually  shipped  to  customer  sites,  unless
  there is an urgent need to carry out on-site development of LSL software.

  Note also, that the procedures, libraries and utilities  are  supplied  only  to
  support LSL software development and will not usually be used by customer staff.

  The specified  versions  of  the  LSLMAINT  package  procedures,  libraries  and
  programs  had  the  following  facilities  added,  implemented  or their actions
  altered.

      (A)  Release Notes - 23-Feb-2000

           1.  The Release Notes have  been  trimmed  back  to  the  last  regular
               release.

      (B)  OSMHLIB_AXP.OLB of 13-Jan-2000

           1.  This is a native Alpha/AXP version of OSMHLIB.OLB.  It was required
               in  order  to  build  a  native version of CONVERT/NTF2I, since the
               translated version of NTF2I did not work on OpenVMS 7.2  due  to  a
               problem in the Fortran run-time library.

      (C)  GKSMOTIFLIB.OLB of 19-Nov-2001 ??????????

           1.  This library has been updated to include support for text rendering
               on MOTIF workstations, in preperation for the withdrawal of support
               for Display PostScript from VMS.

      (D)  TEXTRENLIB.OLB of 19-Nov-2001 ??????????

           1.  This  is  a  new  library  that   supports   the   text   rendering
               functionality  in  GKSMOTIFLIB.   It is based on the sources of the
               current version of TEXTRENLIB used by Gothic (v4-2).  A  subset  of
               the Gothic sources have been copied to VMS and automatically edited
               to ensure that they compile using the VAXC compiler.  A Unix script
               to  copy  the  required  sources  and  a  SED file to edit them are
               included in the module.  The sources used to build this version  of
               the library are stored in CMS.
