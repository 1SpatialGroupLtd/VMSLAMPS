Sections are used to separate the data resulting from different
digitising sessions. Such data may all be part of the same map, but
the coordinate system used in one section will not necessarily be the
same as that of another (due to the map being repositioned between
sessions). Data sent to customers is unlikely to still be split up in
this fashion, although at least one section must be present within a
map.

.P 0; Due to the nature of the digitising process, either using LASERAID or a
manual table system, IFF files will usually contain data from several
digitising sessions. Each time a digitising session is started the IFF file is
extended with a new header sequence of NS (New Section), CC (Cubic
Coefficients) and CP (Control Points) entries. A new layer is then opened and
the additional digitising added.

.P 0;It is essential that the multiple sections of an IFF file and the
fragmentary layers be concatenated before further LAMPS processing may be
conducted. LAPROCESS must first be used if the IFF file was digitised using
LASERAID. Then either IMERGE or LITES2 may be used to consolidate all the layer
parts from different sessions, before further IMP processing. If IMERGE is used
the IFF file should be merged to itself, for example: 

.P 0;$ IMERGE/LOG SHEET274NE__CONTOURS.IFF SHEET274NE__CONTOURS.IFF

.P 0;The consolidated file will be given the next highest version number to
that of the input file.

.P 0;An IFF file which contains multiple CC entries should be treated with care.
Check that the CC entries are set to describe the unit transform (examine the
example CC entry above to see what a unit transform looks like). If they
are not then examine the NS (New Section) or HI (HIstory) entry (if present) to
determine whether the file was digitised using LASERAID. If LASERAID was used
you may safely use LAPROCESS to apply the cubic coefficients. Use the IMP
IMERGE utility to merge the file into itself. This will concatenate the
sections and all layer fragments within the file. LITES2 may be used as an
alternative to IMERGE. 

.P 0;If there is no evidence from the HI or NS entry that the file was
digitised using LASERAID consult the flowline supervisor. The CC entry may have
been set by special purpose software and thus the file should not be processed
using LAPROCESS.
