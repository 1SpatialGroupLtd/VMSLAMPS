LSL IFF files are word-addressed direct-access binary files, with a variable
length record mechanism (Entries) superimposed.  Coordinates are held
as 32-bit (single precision) floating point binary numbers. This gives them a
range of 10_*_*38 to 10_*_*-38, and between 7 and 8 significant figures.

All coordinates in a file are assumed by the software to be relative to a local
origin, the value of which is held in a Map Descriptor at the start of the
file, as a pair of 64-bit (double-precision) floating point binary numbers.
This gives a range of 10_*_*38 to 10_*_*-38, and between 15 and 16 significant
figures. 

One of the main advantages of coordinate storage as floating point rather than
integer numbers, is that IFF files are largely independent of the units of the
data stored in them.  The important thing to remember is that the choice of unit does not affect the
precision of the data, because fractional values can be stored as easily as tens
or millions.

A DEC 32-bit (single precision) floating point binary number has 1 sign bit,
8 exponent bits, and a 23 bit mantissa. Because the value is always normalised,
the first mantissa bit which would always be a 1 is assumed, giving an effective
mantissa of 24 bits. This gives a precision of approximately 1 part in 2_*_*23,
allowing 33,554,433 positive values, doubled to 67,108,865 if negative values
are used.

The 64-bit double precision origin offset has the same structure, but has
a 55 bit mantissa, allowing more than 1,000,000,000,000,000 distinct values.

The combination of the single precision coordinate with the double precision
offset allows us to store coordinates in a uniform space, which can typically
cover the whole earth to a ground precision of much better than 1mm in
typical sized IFF files.
