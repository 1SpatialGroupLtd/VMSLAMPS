.HL 1 ^^^&Introduction\&
This note defines the method and limits of coordinate storage in
IFF data files, as implemented by Laser-Scan LAMPS mapping software,
and to show that no loss of coordinate precision is likely to
result in ordinary use. 

.HL 1 ^^^&Storage\&
LSL IFF files are word-addressed direct-access binary files, with a variable
length record mechanism (Entries) superimposed. Coordinates within IFF are
held in ST, ZS or CB entries, depending on whether they are 2D, 3D, or 
multi-dimensional points. Regardless of entry type, coordinates are held
as 32-bit (single precision) floating point binary numbers. This gives them a
range of 10_*_*38 to 10_*_*-38, and between 7 and 8 significant figures.
.P 0
All coordinates in a file are assumed by the software to be relative to a local
origin, the value of which is held in a Map Descriptor at the start of the
file, as a pair of 64-bit (double-precision) floating point binary numbers.
This gives a range of 10_*_*38 to 10_*_*-38, and between 15 and 16 significant
figures. It is not necessary that this local origin should be one of the corners
or the middle of the area, merely that it should lie reasonably close to the
area. Conventionally, it is often set so that the bottom left corner of the
sheet lies at (0,0), but it is quite acceptable for several files to share
the same origin offset, eg of the current UTM zone "brick".

.HL 1 ^^^&Units\&
One of the main advantages of coordinate storage as floating point rather than
integer numbers, is that IFF files are largely independent of the units of the
data stored in them. Map data is often stored with ground metres as the unit,
but IFF data can and does handle units as distinct as lat/long degrees, seconds
of arc, feet, miles, nautical miles, sheet mm, sheet thou, or if you want to be
ambitious, microns or parsecs! 
.P 0
The important thing to remember is that the choice of unit does not affect the
precision of the data, because fractional values can be stored as easily as tens
or millions.

.HL 1 ^^^&Precision\&
A DEC 32-bit (single precision) floating point binary number has 1 sign bit,
8 exponent bits, and a 23 bit mantissa. Because the value is always normalised,
the first mantissa bit which would always be a 1 is assumed, giving an effective
mantissa of 24 bits. This gives a precision of approximately 1 part in 2_*_*23,
allowing 33,554,433 positive values, doubled to 67,108,865 if negative values
are used.
.P 0
The 64-bit double precision origin offset has the same structure, but has
a 55 bit mantissa, allowing more than 1,000,000,000,000,000 distinct values.
.P 0
The combination of the single precision coordinate with the double precision
offset allows us to store coordinates in a uniform space, which can typically
cover the whole earth to a ground precision of much better than 1mm in
typical sized IFF files.
.P 0
The precision if you ^&really\& want to store the whole
world in one IFF file is still better than a ground metre. In large scale work
where more precision is needed, the effective scale and consequent data volumes
always necessitates spatial partitioning of the data, so that precision is
automatically maintained.
.P 0
Where multiple IFF files are handled together, as in IMERGE, or LITES2, the
coordinate storage is not affected, but the ^&difference\& in origin offsets is
used to relate coordinates in the various files. The same rules about area and
precision therefore apply. 

.HL 1 ^^^&Accuracy\&
Accuracy is a controversial subject when applied to map data. It is a term
which probably best describes the "level of confidence" in a coordinate value.
For typical coordinate data which has been hand digitised from printed maps,
it is affected by such factors as the original surveyor's care, the geodetic
calculations involving trig points, the map drawing, the printing process,
the paper stretch, the digitising operator's care, the table setup method,
the digitising table hardware, and the software transformation to ground units.
.P 0
What is fairly certain however is that it is not affected thereafter by storage
in IFF files! Because the IFF coordinates are stored in "Real World" units eg
ground metres, and the same storage system is at the heart of all LSL mapping
software, coordinates do not have to be transformed further in the course of
normal operation, and hence do not suffer from rounding errors.
