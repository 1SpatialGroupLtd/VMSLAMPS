.HL 1 ^^^*Introduction\*
.P 0
The first version of this document was issued for the Laser-Scan Mapping
User Group meeting in Cambridge on 20th/21st May 1987. This new version
covers the period to 31st December 1987.
.P 0
It gives a brief description of the functionality of each of the Laser-Scan
standard LAMPS software packages, its major components, and a description
of enhancements since the previous status report.
.P 0
It is intended for LAMPS system managers and experienced LAMPS users.

.HL 2 ^^^*Package Layout\*
.P 0
LAMPS standard software is divided for distribution and installation purposes
into "packages". These packages do not necessarily correspond exactly to the
grouping of software for sales and marketing purposes, and may be changed
in name and content at the discretion of Laser-Scan.
.P 0
The packages are grouped into:
.LITERAL

LAMPS Kernel packages:		LSLSYSTEM, MAPPING

LAMPS Basic packages:		IMP, LITES2, PLOTTING

LAMPS Optional packages:	LASERAID, DIGSYS, CONVERT, STRUCTURE, POLYGONS

LAMPS Matrix packages:		MATRIX, DTMCREATE, DTMPREPARE, DTMPROCESS,
				TVES, IMAGEPROCESS 

LAMPS Device Support packages:	HRD, LASERPLOT, HIACC, ARGS, SIGMA, MUART, TABLE

Miscellaneous related packages:	LSLMAINT, DASHEX, DECUS
.END LITERAL
.P 0
The LAMPS Device Support packages and some of the miscellaneous related
packages are described in outline only, as in general they are not used
directly by LAMPS customers. 

.HL 2 ^^^*Development Overview\*
.P 0
There have been some developments in almost all software packages since May, but
the particular developments may be of note:
.LIST 'o'
.LE
Fundamental developments have been made in the central core of MAPPING, IMP,
LITES2, and PLOTTING to support "IFF Revision 1" which allows use of 3D
coordinate strings, multiple per-point attributes, and a flexible, unified
attribute definition mechanism (ACDs). See the MAPPING package for more
details. 
.LE
As a consequence of the above development, the central core programs now support
3D coordinates, even when Revision 1 is not enabled.
.LE
The STRUCTURE package has been enhanced, and combined with the development
of the new POLYGONS package, gives the ability to create and manipulate
structured polygon data. This is of particular relevance to GIS applications.
.LE
The matrix handling packages are undergoing considerable development at present
to provide a uniform interaction environment, a more logical package
layout, and support for VAXstation graphics screens. As part of this, the
documentation is being largely rewritten, and all these packages will be
reissued in 1988.
.END LIST

.PAGE
.HL 1 ^^^*LAMPS Kernel Packages\*

.HL 2 ^^^*LSLSYSTEM - Laser-Scan System Support Software\*
.P 0
The Laser-Scan system software support package (LSLSYSTEM) is required by
all LSL software components. It includes environment setup command files,
supplementary system utilities, and utility programs needed by more than
one package.


.P 0
Principal components include:
.LITERAL

LAMPSINSTALL.COM	software installation procedure
LSLUPDATE.COM		software upgrade procedure
OPER.COM		example VMS operator procedure
FREE.COM, PROTECT, MV 	file management utility command procedures
NV.COM, REPEAT		more utility command procedures
FLUSH, MLOAD, SLAVE.COM	microprocessor load utilities
LST, MUL		print utilities
CALC, CVT, ERROR	number conversion utilities
MTDUMP, QUO, SD, SI	system utilities
LSLLIB.OLB		basic LSL routine library
LSLSHR.EXE		LSL routine library shared image
.END LITERAL

.P 0
Recent enhancements include:
.LIST 'o'
.LE
Automated software installation procedure LAMPSINSTALL has been improved to
simplify installation of LAMPS software on new customer computers, using a
customer-specific issue tape generated at Laser-Scan. Note that this procedure
is still intended for use by a LSL software engineer. LAMPS is not
customer-installable.
.LE
Automated software upgrade procedure LSLUPDATE has been improved and documented,
and now allows upgrade by customer of LAMPS software packages on existing
LAMPS computer systems. 
.LE
Various number conversion utilities (CALC, CVT, ERROR) have been moved to
LSLSYSTEM from LSLMAINT as they have been found to be generally useful. Note
that these are not part of supported LAMPS software, but are supplied "as is".
.LE
Various utility command procedures (FREE, MV, NV, PROTECT, REPEAT) have been
moved to
LSLSYSTEM from LSLMAINT as they have been found to be generally useful. Note
that these are not part of supported LAMPS software, but are supplied "as is" 
as examples.
.LE
The LSLLIB object library is now distributed as part of LSLSYSTEM, not for
direct customer use, but because it is referenced by other standard libraries,
eg LSLFRTLIB.
.LE
Note that LSLSYSTEM now contains LSLSHR, a shared image of LSLLIB basic
routines, which is referred to by most LSL applications programs. 
This image must be pointed at by logical name LSL$LSLSHR, and should be
installed /SHARE at system startup time.
Use of this shared image results in smaller image size for LAMPS programs,
better sharing of memory, and ease of installing modifications and upgrades
to LAMPS software.
.END LIST

.PAGE
.HL 2 ^^^*MAPPING - Laser-Scan Mapping Kernel Software\*
.P 0
The Laser-Scan Mapping Kernel Software package (MAPPING) is required by all
other LAMPS software components. It includes the IFF file interface library
(IFFLIB), the Feature Representation library (FRTLIB), as well as 
various central LAMPS initialisation and control procedures. 


.P 0
Principal components include:
.LITERAL

LSLFRTLIB.OLB		Feature Representation Table interface library
FRTLIB.OLB		Feature Representation Table interface library (obs)
SRINORM			FRT (SRI/TRI) Symbol normaliser
IFFLIB.OLB		IFF database file interface library
IFFSHR.EXE		IFF routine library shared image
.END LITERAL

.P 0
Recent enhancements include:
.LIST 'o'
.LE
FRTLIB has been tidied and converted internally to use LSLLIB standard library
routines rather than VIOLIB. The recommended library is now called
LSLFRTLIB.OLB. 
.LE
Note that MAPPING now contains IFFSHR, a shared image of IFFLIB interface
routines, which is referred to by most LAMPS IFF handling programs. 
This image must be pointed at by logical name LSL$IFFSHR, and should be
installed /SHARE at system startup time. The advantages of using this
are as for LSLSHR in packages LSLSYSTEM.
.LE
Symbols and text characters may now be displayed with different colours and
thicknesses for elements of the symbol, eg a red thin circle with a green 
thick line through.
It also allows the thickness and colour
of symbols in patterned lines to be different from the line.
To achieve this, LSLFRTLIB (and hence the actions of display programs such as
LITES2 and FPP) has been modified to make colour and thickness for elements of
symbols and text characters be overriding from the SCT rather than the FRT
section of the FRT file. 
.LE
Development is now complete on a major enhancement to the IFF library and file
format. This is called "IFF Revision 1", and includes support for
3D coordinate strings, "per-point" attributes and a flexible "Attribute Code
Definition" system. 
It is intended that this revision should be largely upwards compatible
with existing utilities, but customers will have to relink all of their
own IFF utilities if they want to make use of the new facilities.
.LE
IFF revision 1 has to be explicitly enabled by defining the logical name
LSL$IFF__REVISION as 1. If it is not enabled, then all modified utilities
will still create and expect ST (and possibly ZS) coordinate entries
in IFF files, so as to give upwards compatability.
.LE
If LSL$IFF__REVISION is enabled as 1, then all modified utilities will still
accept ST/ZS entries, but will also accept and will create the new CB
(Coordinate Block) entries. However, the IFF library will by default present
CBs as fake STs so that user programs which are not interested in the new
per-point attributes will not require modification, merely relinking.

.P 0
This package includes device support utilities for use of a digitising table
(usually an Altek table),
the Table Monitor program and its interface library, and support routines for
non-standard table. 
.P 0
The Table Monitor is a detached process which runs at elevated priority and
receives digitising events from the table. It then communicates these events to
an applications process (such as LITES2 or TVES). It is used in cases where
stream mode input from the table is required, eg for smooth screen cursor
tracking from digitising table puck movement. 
.P 0
The non-standard table support routines are used when the table cannot produce
Altek format data. Shared image routines are included for GTCO and
Summagraphics tables, and an example source program which can be amended and
built to produce a shared image for any further tables required.
