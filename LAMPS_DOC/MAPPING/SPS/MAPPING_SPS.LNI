  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan IFF Mapping Kernel package (MAPPING) provides basic  support  and
  interface  libraries  for  the applications packages that make up the Laser-Scan
  Automated Map Production System (LAMPS).

  It is recommended that the reader becomes familiar with  the  LAMPS  Environment
  Guide  which  outlines  in  some  detail  the  hardware and software environment
  required by the LAMPS package as a whole (of which MAPPING is the kernel).

  IFF stands for [3mI[0mnternal [3mF[0meature [3mF[0mormat and is the Laser-Scan vector file  format
  generated  by  VTRAK  and  other Laser-Scan mapping systems and used as the data
  structure throughout the Laser-Scan LAMPS system.   IFF  files  are  binary  and
  cannot  be  manipulated  directly  using  a  text  editor.   The MAPPING package
  provides two interface libraries, IFFLIB to allow customers to write programs to
  read  and write IFF files, and FRTLIB to look up the representational attributes
  of IFF features in Feature Representation Tables.



  2  [3m[1mFACILITIES[0m

  The following facilities are included in the MAPPING package software.   Further
  details can be found in the IFF User Guide, the IFFLIB Reference Manual, the FRT
  User Guide, and the FRTLIB Reference Manual, but the presence or  absence  of  a
  facility in such a manual does not imply any commitment by Laser-Scan.

       1.  The IFFLIB interface library  supplies  Fortran  callable  routines  to
           provide the following facilities:

            *  Accept Laser-Scan IFF (Internal Feature Format) data as input  from
               disk.

            *  Write IFF data to disk, creating new IFF files.

            *  Modify existing IFF files by rewriting selected entries.

            *  Decode the binary entry structure of IFF files.

            *  Scan IFF files sequentially, entry by entry.

            *  Reposition to any previously read entry  by  remembering  the  word
               address in the file.

            *  Delete existing entries by converting them to "Void" entries.

            *  Create new entries either at end of file,  or  by  writing  into  a
               void.


       2.  The FRTLIB interface library  supplies  Fortran  callable  routines  to
           provide the following facilities:

            *  Read Laser-Scan FRT (Feature Representation Table) files from disk.

            *  Read Laser-Scan SRI (Symbol Representation IFF) files from disk.

            *  Read Laser-Scan TRI (Text Representation IFF) files from disk.

            *  Look up the  Feature  Code  (FC)  from  IFF  features  in  the  FRT
               information, to return:
                  - Graphical Type
                  - Colour
                  - Width
                  - Size
                  - Secondary code
                  - Flag bits (optional)
                  - Hardware symbol number (optional)
                  - Priority level/alternative feature code pairs (optional)

            *  Look up the secondary code for lines to get line pattern.

            *  Look up the secondary code for symbols to  get  symbol  shape  from
               SRI.

            *  Look up the secondary code for texts to  get  character  font  from
               TRI.

            *  Look up the secondary code for areas to get fill style.

            *  Draw symbols and text characters using GKS calls.


       3.  The SRI/TRI Normalisation Utility SRINORM can scale symbols  to  fit  a
           (-1,-1)  to  (1,1)  "unit"  box,  removing  the  need for symbols to be
           digitised to precise scale, and allowing a  single  SRI  symbol  to  be
           drawn at different sizes via the FRT size entry.

  LSL IFF files are word-addressed direct-access binary  files,  with  a  variable
  length record mechanism (Entries) superimposed.  Coordinates within IFF are held
  in  ST,  ZS  or  CB  entries,  depending  on  whether  they  are  2D,   3D,   or
  multi-dimensional  points.   Regardless  of  entry type, coordinates are held as
  32-bit (single precision) floating point binary  numbers.   This  gives  them  a
  range of 10**38 to 10**-38, and between 7 and 8 significant figures.

  All coordinates in a file are assumed by the software to be relative to a  local
  origin, the value of which is held in a Map Descriptor at the start of the file,
  as a pair of 64-bit (double-precision)  floating  point  binary  numbers.   This
  gives  a  range of 10**38 to 10**-38, and between 15 and 16 significant figures.
  It is not necessary that this local origin should be one of the corners  or  the
  middle  of  the  area,  merely  that it should lie reasonably close to the area.
  Conventionally, it is often set so that the bottom left corner of the sheet lies
  at  (0,0), but it is quite acceptable for several files to share the same origin
  offset, eg of the current UTM zone "brick".

  4  [3mUnits[0m

  One of the main advantages of coordinate storage as floating point  rather  than
  integer  numbers,  is that IFF files are largely independent of the units of the
  data stored in them.  Map data is often stored with ground metres as  the  unit,
  but  IFF data can and does handle units as distinct as lat/long degrees, seconds
  of arc, feet, miles, nautical miles, sheet mm, sheet thou.



  5  [3mPrecision[0m

  A DEC 32-bit (single precision) floating point binary number has 1 sign  bit,  8
  exponent  bits,  and a 23 bit mantissa.  Because the value is always normalised,
  the first mantissa bit which would always be a 1 is assumed, giving an effective
  mantissa  of  24 bits.  This gives a precision of approximately 1 part in 2**23,
  allowing 33,554,433 positive values, doubled to 67,108,865  if  negative  values
  are used.

  The 64-bit double precision origin offset has the same structure, but has  a  55
  bit mantissa, allowing more than 1,000,000,000,000,000 distinct values.

  The combination of the single precision coordinate  with  the  double  precision
  offset  allows  us  to store coordinates in a uniform space, which can typically
  cover the whole earth to a ground precision of much better than 1mm  in  typical
  sized IFF files.
