! Template Lookup File for POLMERGE
!
! The lookup file has two functions:
!
! 1. It determines whether a polygon of a particular code is to be
! considered for merging or elimination.  Only a polygon with a code
! specified on the first line of a definition set is considered as
! a valid candidate.  The term 'primary polygon' is used to define this
! polygon.
! This provides a mechanism by which certain polygons may be excluded
! from merging or elimination.
!
! 2. It determines with which other polygons, a polygon may be merged.
! The codes specified on all but the first line of a definition set are 
! valid candidates for being merged into.  The term 'secondary polygons'
! is used to define these polygons.
!
! The codes are specified in alphanumeric form, and are compared against
! the text field entries of a type 4 or type 5 AC 
!
! The character '!' is used to indicate a comment line.
!
! A blank line is used to separate a series of defintion sets.
! The first line of a defintion set determines the primary polygon label
! Subsequent lines define a set of secondary polygon labels.
!
! First set of definitions.  CODE1 is matched with CODE2,CODE3,CODE4 and
! CODE7

CODE1
CODE2
CODE3
CODE5
CODE6
! Second set of definitions.  CODE2 is matched with CODE5 and CODE6

CODE2
CODE5	 
CODE6
! Third set of definitons.   CODE3 is matched with CODE4,CODE5 and CODE6

CODE3
CODE5
CODE6
! In this example, a map of polygons with 6 different labels is assumed,
! namely (CODE1,CODE2,CODE3,CODE4,CODE5 and CODE6). 
! Polygons labelled with CODE1,CODE2, or CODE3 are defined in the file as 
! primary candidates for merging.  Polygons with CODE4,CODE5 or CODE6 are
! not defined as primary candidates.
! If a primary polygon with a label of CODE1 is encountered, it is a
! candidate for merging into polygons with labels CODE2,CODE3,CODE5 and
! CODE6 but not CODE6.
! If a primary polygons with a label of CODE2 is encountered, it is a
! candidate for merging into a polygon with the label CODE5 or CODE6.
! If a primary polygon with a label of CODE3 is encountered, it is also
! a candidate for merging into a neighbouring polygon wuth a label of
! CODE5 or CODE6.
!
! As a result of these defintions a polygon with a label of CODE4 is
! excluded from any merge or elimination operation.  Polygons with the
! label CODE5 or CODE6 are candidates only for merging into, but not
! are considered as primary candidates.
