.CENTRE ;^&IFNODE - Node Extraction from Junction IFF Files\&

.P 0

IFNODE is a utility which takes a junction IFF file (usually created using
LAJ, VTRAK or IFJ), extracts the junction positions from it and creates an
output
IFF file (of default type .NDE) containing these nodes as point symbols.
This file may then be plotted as it stands, or merged with other IFF data.
Facilities are available for specifying which overlay will contain the point
symbols, which feature code is to be associated with them, and their size
(THickness) if appropriate.

.P 0

IFNODE is normally defined as a foreign command. The command syntax of this
utility conforms to (and is in fact more general than) that of standard
VAX/VMS programs, and is (in its most general form):

.LITERAL

    IFNODE [/OVERLAY=n] [/CODE=n] [/SIZE=n] [FROM] infile [[TO] outfile]
.END LITERAL

.P 0
The following switches are recognised:
.LIST " "
.LE
/OVERLAY=n
.BR
/LAYER=n
.BL
Specifies the number of the overlay which will contain the point features.
.LE
/CODE=n
.BR
/FCODE=n
.BR
/FEATURE__CODE=n
.BL
Specifies which feature code they will have (i.e. sets the first word
in the FS entries).
.LE
/SIZE=n
.BR
/THICKNESS=n
.BL
Specifies their size if the symbols are scalable (i.e. sets the TH entries).
.END LIST

.P 0
All switches may be abbreviated (but must, of course, be unambiguous).
If a switch is specified, it MUST be given an (integer) argument,
e.g.

.LITERAL

    IFNODE/OV=5/FC=54 FRED
.END LITERAL

.P 0
which will take IFF file LSL$IF:FRED.IFF and produce IFF file LSL$IF:FRED.NDE
with layer 5 and feature codes of 54. The following examples illustrate the
command syntax:

.LITERAL

    IFNODE/OV=5/FC=54 FRED JIM

    IFNODE/OV=3 FROM FRED TO .TMP

    IFNODE/FC=7/SIZE=20 TO JIM FROM FRED

    IFNODE/OV=5/FC=54 FRED [JIM]
.END LITERAL

.P 0

Error messages produced by IFNODE conform to VAX/VMS conventions, and are
hopefully all self-explanatory. In addition, IFNODE sets $STATUS and hence
any failure may be detected from within command files.
