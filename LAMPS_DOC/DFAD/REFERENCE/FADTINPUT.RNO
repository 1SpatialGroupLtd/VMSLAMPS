.LM +10

.P0;Default values for the ACC, DSI, FADT and HEADER (DLMS) forms can be set by the
system manager in a lookup file pointed to by the logical name
LSL$FADTINPUT__DEFAULTS, which must be defined in the system table. 
If this logical name is not defined then FADTINPUT
reads the file LSL$LOOKUP:FADT__DEFAULTS.DAT which is 
supplied by Laser-Scan. This file can be copied and used as a template
for an alternative lookup file. 

.P0;The lookup file is an ASCII file of records
consisting of commands, sub-commands and parameters. 
Any text starting with the "!" character is regarded as a comment, and is 
ignored. Comments can appear on the same lines as commands, or on 
separate lines. Note that commands may be in upper or lower case,
but cannot be abbreviated.

.P0;Each record must begin with one of the commands
ACC, DSI, DLMS, or FADT. The ACC, DSI, and DLMS commands must be followed
by a sub-command which has a single parameter which must be a quoted string
with double quotes. The FADT command does 
not have a sub-command but is followed by a set of parameters. The
parameters for the FADT command ^*must not\* be a quoted string. The

.P0;Optionally, the user may control the operation of FADTINPUT by defining 
certain logical names before FADTINPUT is invoked. These logical names will 
control the overall function carried out by FADTINPUT, and the specifications 
of the files which the program uses. The logical names are described below:

.BL
.TP10
.P0;^*LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION\*
.I0;The logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION controls the operation 
carried out by FADTINPUT. LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION may be defined to have the 
a value of '1', '2' or '3'. These values are equivalent to 
selecting options '1', '2' or '3' on the 'Command Options' form. The 
specifications for files used by FADTINPUT will be taken from the definitions 
of the other logical names, as described below.
.I0;The values of LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION specify the following 
FADTINPUT operations:

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS D

.LE;^*Create a new FADT file\*

.LE;^*Edit an existing FADT file\*

.LE;^*List an existing FADT file\*

have a legal value ('1', '2' or '3') then an error message will be produced 
and the execution of FADTINPUT will be terminated.
.I0;The contents of any list file produced will not be sent to the printer by 
FADTINPUT when it is operating under the control of logical names.

.BL
.TP10;.P0;^*LSL$FADTINPUT__FADT\*
.I0;The logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__FADT is used to specify the FADT file to be

defined, the default specification 'LSL$FADT:FADT.FADT' will be used.

.BL

LSL$FADTINPUT__RULE is not defined, then 
validation of FADT records will only be performed against the DLMS 
specification, and not against a rule file.
.I0;The logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__RULE will only be examined by FADTINPUT if

specification will be parsed against 
'FADT.LIS'. If LSL$FADTINPUT__LIST is not defined, a default list file

.HEADER LEVEL 1 ^*DESCRIPTION\*
.INDEX FADTINPUT> DESCRIPTION
.LM +10
.P0;FADTINPUT is a utility to create, modify and list 
a DLMS FADT file. This file may subsequently be merged with DFAD geometry data 
using the utility FADTMERGE.

.P0;FADTINPUT performs validation on the FADT records against the DLMS
Specification, and optionally against a set of validation rules in a user
specified rule file. Validation is performed as data are entered using the
FADT feature record form. Validation is carried out, firstly on a field by
field basis as each value is entered, with a message displayed to indicate if a
given field is possibly invalid. Secondly, since this is only a partial check
on compliance with the validation rules, after the entry of each complete
record, it is rechecked in its entirety. If the record fails
validation, an indication is given of each field which may be in error. 

.P0;Note that since the validation rules are only intended as a guide, the
program does not enforce compliance with the rules. The user may choose to
ignore the validation warning messages in order to enter features with
exceptional attribute values. 

.BL 2
.P0;FADTINPUT is form driven, using the DEC Form Management System (FMS). A
detailed description of each form is given below in the section on 'Command
and Data Entry Forms'. 

.P 0;The following keys may be used to control movement
between, and entry of data into, forms and fields: 
.LM +15

.P -12;^*TAB and PF4\*#Advances the cursor to the next field in the form. 
Attempting to advance forward from the last field on a form will result in the 
message ^*'No next field on form'\* being displayed.

.P -12;^*BS and F17\*##Moves the cursor back to the previous field on the form. 
If an attempt is made to move back from the first field on a form, the message 
^*'No previous field on form'\* is displayed.

.P -12;^*Line Feed\*###Deletes the contents of the current field.

.P -12;^*Return\*######Exits from a form. Any data 
entered will be saved by the program. It is not possible to exit from a form 
unless data for all mandatory fields have been entered.

.P -12;^*GOLD(PF1)/7\*#This may be used on the command options, record type
option and in all record entry forms. In the case of the two options forms,
this command is equivalent to exit. On the data entry forms, the command
discards any data entered already, and returns the user to the record type
option form. No check is made on whether data for mandatory fields have been
entered. 

.P -12;^*PF2\*#########This is the help key. For most fields on the data entry 
forms, pressing the key will give details of the format and type of data 
required, on the bottom line of the screen.

.P -12;^*CTRL#W\*######Refreshes (i.e. redisplays) the current form.
.LM -15

.P0;Movement within a field, for editing purposes, is controlled by the back 
arrow (to move to the right) and forward arrow (to move to the left) keys.

.P0;On most of the forms, default values will initially appear in some of the 
fields. These may be edited as required by the user and the numeric keys on the
keypad may be used.

.P0;When a data entry form is displayed, if the record to which it relates
already exists in the FADT file, then the contents of the record are displayed
on the screen. This occurs immediately the form appears in the case of the
DLMS header, accuracy, accuracy region and DSI records; and after the entry of
a Feature Analysis Code (FAC) value in the case of the FADT record form. 

.P0;Optionally, the user may control the operation of FADTINPUT by means of 
the logical names LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION, LSL$FADTINPUT__FADT, 
LSL$FADTINPUT__RULE and LSL$FADTINPUT__LIST. These logical names should be 
defined to have the required values before FADTINPUT is invoked.

.P0;If the logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION is assigned a value of 
'1' or '2', specifying the creation of a new FADT file or the modification of 
an existing FADT file respectively, the first form displayed will be the 
'Record Type Option' form.

.P0;If the logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION is assigned the value '3', 
specifying the listing of an existing FADT file, then the operation of 
FADTINPUT will proceed without any forms being displayed and without any user 
interaction being required. The list file produced will not be 
sent to the printer.

.P0;If the logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION is not defined, then the 
operation of FADTINPUT will proceed without reference to any other logical 
names. The first form displayed will be the 'Command Options' form.

.P0;If the logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION is not defined, this form is 
displayed, after the FADT file and rule file 
specification form, if either option 1 or 2 on the command option form is 
selected. If LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION is defined to be either '1' or '2',  then 
this form is the first to be displayed when FADTINPUT starts to execute.

.P0;It allows the user to select which type of record to enter or modify next. 
Selection of the exit option returns control to the 'Command Options' form, if 
the logical name LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION was not defined before FADTINPUT was 
executed. Selecting the exit option when FADTINPUT is operating under control 
of logical names, that is when LSL$FADTINPUT__ACTION was defined to have the 
values '1' or '2', exits from FADTINPUT.

.P0;The same option may be selected any number of times in a particular 
session. This allows the user considerable flexibility in creating and altering 
new and existing records.

.P0;On selecting an option, if the corresponding record already exists in the
FADT file, then the existing values are displayed in the form's fields. If the
record does not exist, default values set up for that form's fields will be
displayed.

.BR;^*DESCRIPTION:\*
.LM +10
.P0;This form is used to enter the FADT records. Each field and record will be 
validated as it is entered, against the 
DLMS specification and optionally against entries in a DLMS Rule file.

.P0;When the form is first displayed, the user is required to enter a
FAC range by entering a starting value in the 'From:' field and an ending
value in the 'To:' field. The ending value must always be greater than or equal 
to the starting value. A starting value must always be specified
but and ending value need not be specified, so that a single FAC can be entered.
The ending value can be be left blank, by skipping over the 'To' field with 
TAB.
Pressing RETURN at this stage will cause control to return to the record type
option form. 

.P 0;If a single FAC value is entered, the program will search the FADT 
file for a corresponding record, and will display its contents on the form if 
a match is found. If a FAC range is entered, the program will check the FADT 
file for any records in the range which already exist. If any are found
then an error message is displayed and the user is prompted
to re-enter the range. 

.P 0;After entry of a FAC the user is required to enter an FID. The
program then checks to see if the FID entered had an entry in the
FADT defaults file. If so then the default values are displayed in the 
rest of the fields on the form. The user must enter values into any
fields that do not have defaults.

.P 0;If a FAC range had been specified then the data values entered 
either by default or by the user will apply to all records in the range. 

.P0;When the user completes entry of a field, it will be checked against
the DLMS specification and optionally against entries in a Rule file.
If validation fails, the following messages may be displayed: 
.LM +5

.P0;^*'field-name' does not obey DLMS specification. Please check.\*
.P0;^*'field-name' may not obey validation table general rules. Please check.\
*
.P0;^*'field-name' may not obey validation table specific rules. Please check.
\*
.LM -5

.P0;Where 'field-name' indicates a field on the FADT form. 

.P 0;When validating with a Rule file, general rules are applied to all FADT
records regardless of Feature Identifier (FID), whereas the specific rules are
only applied to records with a particular FID. 

.P0;It is not possible to say whether a particular field taken in isolation is
definitely valid or invalid, because the validation rules are designed to be
applied to complete records and take into account valid and invalid
combinations of values of fields, as well as individual permissible values.
The rules provide only a guide to normal, expected values, and some
exceptional real features may lie outside them. 

.P0;In the case of the FAC, type and FID fields, invalid entries will not be
accepted, and the user will not be allowed to move to another field until a
valid value is supplied. In the case of other fields (e.g. height) found to be
possibly invalid an advisory message is given, and the cursor remains on the
field until a key to move on to another field is pressed. This allows the user
to alter the field contents if they were genuinely erroneous or to force
acceptance of the entered value. 

.P0;When the user has completed the entry for an entire record, (ie. all 
fields have been given a value), and exits from the form using 
RETURN, the complete record is validated. If it, as a whole, fails, the user is 
told about each field which may have caused this failure, working 
from the top of the form to the bottom. For each such field, the cursor is 
positioned on it, and the user may accept it by pressing RETURN, edit it and 
accept the change by pressing RETURN, or move to other fields using the normal 
keys for this purpose. In the final case, a subsequent RETURN to exit from the 
form will restart the validation of the entire record.

.P0;Once a record has been accepted, a new empty FADT record entry form will
be displayed, and the user may enter another FAC, or press RETURN to go back
to the record type option form. 

.P0;Once a single record has been accepted and entered into the FADT file, 
following validation, it can be deleted by entering its FAC into the 'From:'
field of a new, blank FADT screen form and tabbing past the 'To:' field, then
typing 'GOLD D' ('PF1' followed by 'D' or 'd'). A multiple record can be 
deleted by entering the start of the FAC range in the 'From:' field and the
end of the FAC range in the 'To:' field, then without tabbing any further
type 'GOLD D' as for a single FAC.

.BR;^*MESSAGES:\*
.LM +10
.P0;The following messages are associated with this form:
.LM +5
.P0;^*The FADT record for FAC 'number' already exists.\*
.I0;^*User Action:\* The user should start editing the record as required.

.P0;^*Not recognisable as a number, please check it.\*
.I0;^*User Action:\* The user should check and re-enter the field value.

.P0;^*'field-name' does not obey DLMS specification. Please check.\*
.I0;^*'field-name' may not obey validation table general rules. Please check.
\*
.I0;^*'field-name' may not obey validation table specific rules. Please check.
\*
.I0;^*User Action:\* The user should consider whether the field is valid, and 
re-enter it if it is not.

.P0;^*Validating entire record, please wait\*
.I0;^*User Action:\* The user should wait.

.P0;^*'field-name' may be invalid. Press RETURN to accept it. Otherwise alter 
it.\*
.I0;^*User Action:\* The user should check the field value, and alter 
it if it is wrong. 
Otherwise, RETURN should be pressed to force its acceptance by the program.

.P0;^*FADT record with FAC 'number' deleted\*
,I0;^*User Action:\* The FADT record with the specified FAC has been deleted, 
so the user should continue with the entry of the next record as required.

.P0;^*Unable to delete FADT record with specified FAC\*
.I0;^*User Action:\* The attempt to delete the FADT record with the specified 
FAC has failed, probably because no record with that FAC existed in the FADT 
file. The user should check that the FAC was correctly specified before again 
attempting to delete the record.

.P 0;The above is an example of the output produced by the option to list an 
existing FADT file. This is obtained by entering '3' followed by RETURN on the 
'Command Options' form. The 'Output List File Specification' form is then 
displayed, with default file specifications, which the user should alter as 
required to specify the input FADT file and output list file wanted. Pressing 
RETURN causes exit from this form, and the output list is prepared.

These messages appear on the last line of the terminal screen when a form is
currently displayed. They are all accompanied by an audible warning. They are
designed to:

.P 0;^*Numeric required\*
.I 0;^*Alphabetic required\*
.I0;In most of the forms, there are fields, or sub-fields, which can only 
contain numeric characters or can only contain alphabetic characters. In such 
cases, an attempt to enter a character of the wrong type will result in an 
error message being displayed.
.P 0;^*Field full\*
.I0;An attempt was made to enter more than the allowed number of characters in 
the current field.
.P 0;^*Input required\*
.I0;An attempt was made to exit from a form using RETURN  before data for a 
mandatory field was entered.
.P 0;^*Full field required\*
.I0;An attempt was made to move onto another field before the required number 
of characters had been entered in the current field.

These   messages  give information   only,    and require no
immediate action by  the  user.  They  are  used to  provide
information on  the  current  state  of the  program, or  to
supply explanatory  information in support  of  a warning or

.HL 1 ^^^*MESSAGES (ERROR)\*

These  messages indicate an  error in processing  which will
cause  the program to terminate. The most likely  causes are
a   corrupt or otherwise  invalid  input file,  or an  error
related to command line processing and file manipulation.

ILLEGLNM, Logical name 'name' has an illegal value or no translation
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
The specified logical name, which is one of those used to 
control FADTINPUT, has an illegal translation. If the logical name is 
used to specify a file, the specification is probably invalid. If the 
logical name is used to specify a command, the command is probably not
recognised. Other error messages indicating the specific nature of 
the problem may be displayed following this message.

.P0; ^*User action:\*
The user should check the translation of the logical name, and ensure that it 
is valid.

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
UNOPNFADT, Unable to open FADT file
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
It has not been possible to open the specified FADT file for
input or output.

.P0; ^*User action:\*
The user should check the input FADT file specification to ensure that it is
a legal and accurate specification. Also, the user should 
examine any other messages generated to determine the reason for the
failure.

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
UNOPNLIST, Unable to open list file
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
It has not been possible to open the specified list file for
output.

.P0; ^*User action:\*
The user should check the input LIST file specification to ensure that it is
a legal and accurate specification. Also, the user should 
examine any other messages generated to determine the reason for the
failure.

.NOJUSTIFY;.TP 10;.P -4
UNOPNRULE, Unable to open rule file
.JUSTIFY

.P0; ^*Explanation:\*
It has not been possible to open the specified rule file for
reading.

.P0; ^*User action:\*
The user should check the input rule file specification to ensure that it is
a legal and accurate specification for a file which exists. Also, the user 
should examine any other messages generated to determine the reason for the
failure.

In addition to the above messages which are generated by FMS and FADTINPUT 
itself, other
messages may be produced by Laser-Scan libraries.  If the cause of such errors 
cannot be traced
by the user and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the input files should be
preserved to facilitate diagnosis.
