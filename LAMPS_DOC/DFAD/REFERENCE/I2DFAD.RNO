.INDEX I2DFAD> DESCRIPTION
.LM +10
.P0;I2DFAD is a utility for transferring data from an IFF file to a Digital 
LandMass System (DLMS) Digital Feature Analysis Data (DFAD) magnetic 
tape.

.P 0;The user may select whether to append a manuscript to any existing
manuscripts on the tape, or to write the data as the first manuscript on the
tape, using the /APPEND and /REWIND qualifiers. If the option to append a
manuscript to a tape is selected, the program checks that the origin of the
new manuscript is valid relative to previous manuscripts.  The DLMS
specification requires manuscripts to be in ascending order of latitude and
longitude (more southerly and westerly first), and in ascending order of data
analysis level. Any problems will be reported to the user, and file transfer
will be abandoned. 

.P 0;The program produces messages giving information about the manuscript,
and on errors encountered during data transfer.  If the /DIAGNOSTICS
qualifier is supplied, more detailed information is produced.

.P0;I2DFAD takes coordinate values relative to the origin from the IFF file 
and outputs them as absolute coordinates.

.P0;The extent of the map is output in the 4th 36-bit Univac word of the 
manuscript header. This extent is usually present in the map header of the IFF 
file, but if these entries are empty then the extent will be calculated from 
the Range entry.

.P0;The first feature of the manuscript is expected to be FAC (FSN) 1 in layer 
1, and it is expected to circumscribe the manuscript area. If this is not the 
case then the program will inform the user and continue.

.P0;Any accuracy region data in layer 0 of the IFF file will be transferred
to an ACC record on the DFAD tape.

.TP 30
.P0;The position on the magnetic tape at which I2DFAD writes the DFAD 
manuscript is dependent on the combination of /[NO]APPEND and /[NO]REWIND 
qualifiers used:

.LM +26
.P -26;^*/NOAPPEND#and#/NOREWIND\*#-#The manuscript is written starting at the 
current tape position. This method should only be used if an IFF file has just 
been output to magnetic tape using I2DFAD and no other operation involving the 
tape has been carried out.

.P -26;^*/APPEND#and#/NOREWIND\*###-#The manuscript is appended to the tape 
after the last existing manuscript. The tape is rewound, and the 
program searches for a trailer block and two tapemarks. It then appends by 
overwriting these three blocks. If there are no manuscripts on the tape, 
a message will be generated indicating that the tape is not in DFAD format 
and file transfer will be abandoned. 
.BR;During the search for the last manuscript, the program will check that the 
origins and corners of successive manuscripts lie in the correct relative 
positions as described in the DLMS specification. Messages are produced 
describing any errors encountered.

.P -26;^*/NOAPPEND#and#/REWIND\*###-#The data are written as the first 
manuscript on the tape. That is, the tape is rewound, and writing starts 
immediately following BOT. This method is normally used when starting a new 
tape.

.P -26;^*/APPEND#and#/REWIND\*#####-#This combination is ^*NOT ALLOWED\*.
.LM -26
.LM -10
.BL 3
.P 0;It is essential that the tape is mounted as a foreign volume prior to
running I2DFAD.  This is achieved using the DCL command MOUNT with the
/FOREIGN qualifier eg_. MOUNT MT0:/FOREIGN

.P0;This example illustrates the use of I2DFAD with the /REWIND qualifier. The 
magnetic tape is rewound and the specified IFF file is written as the 
first manuscript.
.P0;The /DIAGNOSTICS qualifier was also used, so the user is informed whenever 
a block is written to tape.
.P0;The /DEVICE qualifier selects output to tape device 'MS:'.

releasability value of 0. Three features having security or releasability 
values not matching those specified on the command line were found and 
reported by the program.
.P0;Since no /DIAGNOSTICS qualifier is present on the command line, no 
reporting of individual blocks written is carried out.
.P0;Neither /APPEND nor /REWIND was used, so the tape writing will commence 
at the current tape position. This should generally only be used following 
the writing of another manuscript to tape with I2DFAD, when there have been no

In addition to the above messages which are generated by I2DFAD itself, other
messages may be produced by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by Laser-Scan
libraries. In particular, messages may be generated by the IFF library. These
are introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF library users' guide.
In most cases IFF errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should
be the first area of investigation. If the cause of the error cannot be traced
by the user and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the input file should be
preserved to facilitate diagnosis.
