.P 0;FADTMERGE merges a FADT file created by the utility FADTINPUT with
coordinate data contained in an IFF file. Merging is performed on the basis of
feature analysis code (FAC) for the FADT file and feature serial number (FSN)
for the IFF file. Header data contained in the FADT file may in addition be
transferred to the map header of the output file.

^*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\*
.HEADER LEVEL 1 ^*DESCRIPTION\*
.INDEX FADTMERGE> DESCRIPTION
.LM +10
.P 0;FADTMERGE is a utility to combine feature records in a FADT file, with
geometry data in an IFF file. Features are merged on the basis of feature
attribute code (FAC) and feature serial number (FSN). The utility will also
construct the map header and accuracy region descriptions (layer zero
features) in the output file by combining and copying from the FADT and IFF
input files if the /HEADER and /ACCURACY qualifiers are supplied on the
command line. 

.P0;FADTMERGE checks and reports on any feature records in either input file
which cannot be merged because there is no matching feature in the other. 

.P 0;FADTMERGE also checks that the feature code (FC) in an IFF feature is 
compatible with the feature attribute type (FAT) of the FADT feature with 
which it is to be merged. That is, they must obey the formula :

.P5;FC#=#100#+#FAT

.P0;Any features found which do not follow this rule are reported to the user 
with a suitable message. The features will still be merged, and, if it 
was specified, the action of the /FC qualifier will be performed.

.P 0;FADTMERGE does not perform any other validation on the FADT or IFF data. 
For example, it does not check that the map header is of MCE type, it will not
check that features of the same type are in the same IFF file layer, and it
will not check that the IFF feature already contains an AC7 entry. 

.P 0;The diagnostic output is by default directed to SYS$OUTPUT, but may be
sent to a specified file by use of the /LIST qualifier. 

.P 0;With the default command line qualifiers in operation, FADTMERGE will 
combine the input FADT and IFF files to produce the output IFF file as 
follows:
.LM +5;

.P -2;-#The MCE map header will be read from the input IFF file and updated 
with appropriate fields from the DLMS header, accuracy and data set 
identification records, if these are present, in the FADT file. If any 
or all of these records are absent, this is reported in the diagnostic 
printout, and the corresponding fields in the map header are copied unchanged 
from the input IFF file.

.P -2;-#Layer zero in the input file will be copied without change to the
output file.

.P -2;-#The feature records in the FADT file are merged with features 
in the input IFF file, on the basis of FAC and FSN, and are then 
written to the output file. The FADT feature record information is 
held in the IFF file in the text field on a AC7 entry.

.P -2;##The feature codes in the output features are derived from the input FID 
and type values as described above. 

.P -2;##Any features in the input IFF file which do not have a matching record
in the FADT file, and vice versa, are reported in the diagnostic printout and
discarded. 

.P -2;-#All other entries are copied directly from the input IFF file to the 
output file.

This is a typical run of FADTMERGE using the default qualifiers. Input IFF
file 'DFAD' and FADT file 'FADT' have been successfully merged to produce
output IFF file DFAD1. No qualifiers other than /FADT have been specified.
Only minimal diagnostic messages are produced, since no merge mismatches are
encountered. The diagnostics message reports that the IFF map header has been
updated.

In this case, the map header has been dealt with successfully. The /ACCURACY 
qualifier causes the construction of the output IFF file's layer zero features 
from the accuracy region records in the FADT file. FADTMERGE has encountered 
two features in the input IFF file with no matching 
records in the FADT file, as well as three records in the input FADT file with 
no matching features in the input IFF file.

In addition to the above messages which are generated by FADTMERGE itself,
other messages may be produced by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
Laser-Scan libraries. In particular, messages may be generated by the IFF
library. These are introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF library
users' guide. In most cases IFF errors will be due to a corrupt input file, or
a problem with the output file, and this should be the first area of
investigation. If the cause of the error cannot be traced by the user and
Laser-Scan are consulted, then the input and output files should be preserved
to facilitate diagnosis.
