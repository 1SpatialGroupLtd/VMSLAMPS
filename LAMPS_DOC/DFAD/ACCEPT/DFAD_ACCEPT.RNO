.HL 1 ^*Introduction\*

.P 0;This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan
Package DFAD.

.P 0;DFAD is a package containing a number of modules that have been designed
specifically to handle DLMS Digital Feature Analysis Data.  Utilities are
provided to create, examine and validate DFAD data held within a Laser
Scan Internal Feature Format (IFF) file, along with utilities to read and
write a DLMS DFAD format magnetic tape.  In addition modules are provided
to create and modify a Feature Analysis Data Table (FADT); to merge a FADT
with DFAD coordinate information, and to access an on-line DLMS Rules
File.

.p 0;The DFAD package includes the modules DFAD2I, DFADVAL, FADTINPUT,
FADTMERGE, I2DFAD and MCEHED.

.P 0;Data input to the DFAD package is from IFF file, FADT file and
DFAD format magnetic tape.  In addition the package modules FADTINPUT
and DFADVAL utilise a DLMS Rules File.  Output from the package modules
is to IFF file, FADT file and DFAD format magnetic tape.

.HL 1 ^*Overview\*
.P 0;For the purpose of acceptance, an IFF file containing DFAD feature
coordinate data but no DFAD attribute information is provided.  This
acceptance file has an unset MCE Map Header, and a layer 0 containing no DFAD
accuracy regions. Feature attribute data will be merged with the coordinate
data, and map header and accuracy region data will be entered, as part of the
acceptance procedure. Opportunities are provided in the acceptance test to
examine the premerged and merged IFF files using the IMP module IPATCH. 

.P 0;In addition to this IFF file, a second file containing merged and
validated DFAD data is provided.  This file is used with the other IFF 
file for acceptance of the module I2DFAD. 

.P 0;A partially completed FADT file is provided.  The header and accuracy
region records have already been entered, along with all but 3 feature
attribute records.  The remaining attribute records will be entered
interactively during package acceptance.

.P 0;A DLMS Rules File is provided.  This will be used to validate DFAD
analysis data as part of the acceptance of the modules FADTINPUT and DFADVAL.

.P 0;In order to carry out acceptance for the tape conversion modules
I2DFAD and DFAD2I, a scratch magnetic tape is required, and should be loaded
on a tape drive.  The acceptance procedure will inquire the name of the
tape drive.

.P 0;Acceptance will be performed using a supplied DCL command procedure to
invoke the DFAD modules, and issue module commands. For acceptance of the
modules FADTINPUT and MCEHED, and in order to examine the acceptance IFF
file using IPATCH, it is necessary for commands to be typed at the terminal.
The commands that should be entered are detailed in this document. 

.P 0;The acceptance procedure is invoked by typing ^*_@LSL$COM:DFAD__ACCEPT\*

.HL 1 ^*Description_ of_ Acceptance_ Procedure\*

.P 0;The acceptance procedure first demonstrates the module FADTINPUT.
FADTINPUT is used to create, edit and list a FADT file.  This file
contains manuscript header records, accuracy region records, and feature
attribute (analysis) records. The data from the FADT is transferred to
an IFF file, and attached to DFAD features, using the module FADTMERGE.

.P 0;A partially completed FADT will be used for acceptance.  The
header and accuracy records have been entered, and will be examined
and listed as part of acceptance.  All but 3 feature attribute records
have also been entered.  These records will be entered interactively
during acceptance of the module.

.P 0;FADTINPUT will be invoked by the command procedure, and a new version of
the DFAD package acceptance FADT will be created. 

.P 0;The first form to be displayed on the screen is the 'FADTINPUT Record
Type Option'. To examine the completed header record, enter ^*4<CR>\*.
The contents of the FADT header page will be displayed on the screen. Use
^*<CR>\* to return to the 'Record Type Option' form.  To view the 
completed DSI Record, enter ^*2<CR>\*. Following the display of the DSI
data use ^*<CR>\* to return the 'Record Type Option' form. 

.P 0;To view the accuracy records, enter ^*1<CR>\*. The form that appears
first shows the contents of the ACC header record. Note that 2 accuracy
regions are defined for this manuscript.  To view the attributes and
coordinates of the first accuracy region type ^*<CR>\*. Use ^*<CR>\*
again to view the second accuracy region data, and then ^*<CR>\* to
return to the 'Record Type Option' form.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;The next part of acceptance for FADTINPUT involves the input of
analysis data for 3 DFAD features.  Select the option to input FADT
feature records by pressing ^*<CR>\*.  An empty FADT record will be
displayed on the screen, and the cursor will be positioned on the FAC
field.

.P 0;Analysis data for DFAD feature 6008 will be entered first. To do
this, type ^*6008\* and press ^*<TAB>\* (on the lefthand part of the
keyboard).  Note that since this record does not already exist in the 
file, the remaining analysis fields (with the exception of the defaulted
'security' and 'releasability' fields) remain blank.  

.P 0;The cursor will now be positioned in the 'type' field. A DFAD feature may
be of type 0 (point), type 1 (line) or type 2 (area). To check that FADTINPUT
correctly validates any entered values against the DLMS format specification,
enter an invalid number eg. ^*4\* followed by ^*<TAB>\*.  The message ^*'Type
does not obey DLMS Specification'\* will be displayed.  Use the delete key
to cancel this value, and enter a correct value for a point feature by
typing ^*0\* followed by ^*<TAB>\*.

.P 0;The cursor will now be positioned in the 'FID' field.  The correct FID
for this DFAD point feature is 902.  Enter this by typing ^*902\* and press
the ^*<TAB>\* key.  The cursor will now be positioned in the 'height' field.
Enter a value of 20 by typing ^*20\* followed by ^*<TAB>\*.  The 'security'
has already been given a default value of 0.  To accept this value press the
^*<TAB>\* key.  This operation should be repeated for the 'releasability'
field. 

.P 0;The cursor will now be positioned in the 'SMC' field. To enter the
correct value of 3 type ^*3\* followed by ^*<TAB>\*. Use the same operation to
enter values of 10, 20 and 50 for the 'ori', 'width' and 'length' fields
respectively. Note that when ^*<TAB>\* key is pressed after entering the
'length' field, the message ^*'No next field on form'\* is displayed to
indicate that there are no more fields on this form. 

.P 0;To move the cursor to a previous field use the ^*<BS>\* (backspace)
key. Using this key and the ^*<TAB>\* key it is possible to move between
fields on the form.  This mechanism allows fields that have been incorrectly
entered to be modified.

.P 0;To enter the analysis record for this feature into the FADT use
^*<CR>\*.  The message ^*Validating the entire record\* will be displayed
briefly indicating that FADTINPUT is checking the analysis records against
the DFAD acceptance Rules File. This operation involves the validation
of all the analysis data in combination.  Any validation failures are
reported, and the cursor will be automatically positioned over a field
in error, allowing the user to edit a field value. If validation is 
successful, the record will be written to the FADT, and a blank feature
record form will be displayed.

.P 0;Use the operations detailed above to enter analysis data for DFAD point
features 6009 and 6010. The required field values for these features are: 
.NOFILL
.LM +10
.BL
^*FAC 6009 type 0 FID 420 height 8 security 0 releasability 0 SMC 3
         ori 14 width 4 length 20

FAC 6010 type 0 FID 420 height 8 security 0 releasability 0 SMC 3
         ori 63 width 20 length 20\*

.LM -10
.FILL

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;When these records have been successfully entered into the FADT, it is
possible to examine them, and modify them if required. The cursor should now be
positioned in a 'FAC' field of a blank record form. In order to examine the
analysis data associated with DFAD feature 6008, enter ^*6008\* followed by
^*<TAB>\*.  The contents of this record will now be displayed on the form. 
Movement between the form fields is now possible using the ^*<TAB>\* and
^*<BS>\* keys.  To exit from this record use ^*<CR>\*.  Note that the entire
record will again be validated before writing back to the FADT.

.P 0;To return to the 'Record Options Form' use ^*<CR>\*, and select
option 5 on the form by typing ^*5<CR>\* in order to exit from FADTINPUT.
The contents of the FADT will now be saved, and used in the remaining
stages of the acceptance procedure.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;It is possible to list the contents of a FADT file using FADTINPUT.
Answer yes to the question 'List the contents of the FADT file on the
line-printer ?', in order to produce a listing of the DFAD acceptance
FADT. This should be checked to verify that the analysis codes for
features 6008, 6009 and 6010 have been correctly entered.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;The module FADTMERGE is used to transfer FADT records to an
IFF file.  The header, DSI and accuracy header data is transferred to
the relevant fields in a MCE Map Header.  The accuracy region data from
the FADT is used to form a series of accuracy regions in layer 0 of the
IFF file.  The feature records in the FADT, which contain the feature
analysis data are merged with the DFAD feature coordinates (geometry) in
the IFF file.  Merging is performed on the basis of FAC value in the
FADT, and Feature Serial Number (FSN) in the IFF file.

.P 0;Prior to merging an opportunity is offered to examine the unmerged
IFF file using IPATCH.  This is the IFF file that is input into FADTMERGE.
If this option is selected, the following sequence of commands should be 
typed at the terminal, once the IPATCH> prompt is displayed.

.P 0;Type ^*MH<CR>\* to position on the Map Header, and then enter
^*TYPE<CR>\* to list the contents of the entry on the terminal.  Note
that with the exception of the Map Header type, and Map Header length
fields at the beginning of the record, all the remaining fields are unset.

.P 0;Type ^*NO<CR>\* to position on the start of the first layer in the
file.  This will be layer 0.  If you now move to the next entry in the
file by typing ^*NEXT<CR>\*, you will find you are now positioned on the
end of the layer (EO entry). This is because the layer is empty and
currently contains no DFAD accuracy regions.

.P 0;Type ^*NO<CR>\* to position on the start of the next layer.  This is
layer 1 which holds DFAD area features.  Type ^*NEXT<CR>\* and you will be
positioned on the start of the first feature.  Repeat this command 3 times and
you will be positioned in turn on the FS, ST and EF entries for this feature.
Note that there is no AC entry - this will be generated by FADTMERGE and will
hold the feature analysis data. Note also that the feature code is 102 which
is used globally to identify a DFAD point feature.  A feature code that is
specific to the type of area feature will be generated by FADTMERGE. 

.P 0;The ^*NEXT<CR>\* may be repeated a number of times to examine a number
of other features in the file.  Type ^*EXIT<CR>\* to exit from IPATCH.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;FADTMERGE is now invoked to transfer FADT records to the IFF file.
The /ACCURACY /HEADER and /MERGE qualifiers are used to transfer all FADT
records to the IFF file. The /FC qualifier is used so that features in
the output IFF file will be given a feature code that is related to both
the type of feature, and the feature identifier.  The input FADT is the
FADT modified during FADTINPUT acceptance.  Note that if the 3 records
originally missing from the file have not been entered, a mismatch for
FSNs 6008, 6009 and 6010 will be reported by FADTMERGE, and these features
will not be copied to the output file.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;An opportunity is now offered to examine the merged IFF file using
IPATCH. This is the file generated by the module FADTMERGE. 
If this option is selected, the following sequence of commands should be 
typed at the terminal, once the file IPATCH> prompt is displayed.

.P 0;Type ^*MH<CR>\* to position on the Map Header, and then enter
^*TYPE<CR>\* to list the contents of the entry on the terminal.  Note
that a large number of fields in the Map Header are now set. The field
values may be examined more meaningfully during package acceptance for
the DFAD module MCEHED.

.P 0;Type ^*NO<CR>\* to position on the start of the first layer in the
file.  This will be layer 0.  If you now move to the next entry in the
file by typing ^*NEXT<CR>\*, you will find you are positioned on the
start of the first accuracy region. 

.p 0;If the ^*NEXT<CR>\* command is given you will be positioned on the FS.
The feature code for a DFAD accuracy region is 301. If ^*NEXT<CR>\*
is typed again you will be positioned on an AC entry.  The type is 8
indicating an ACC accuracy ancillary code, and the text field will hold the
absolute and relative horizontal accuracy values.  If a listing of the FADT
was produced as part of FADTINPUT acceptance, these values should be compared
with the FADT record values for accuracy region 1. If ^*NEXT<CR>\* is typed
again you will be positioned on the feature's ST entry. If you enter
^*TYPE<CR>\* the coordinates of the accuracy region will be displayed. The
coordinates have been translated from their latitude and longitude DDDMMSS.SH
representation in the FADT, to latitude and longitude in .1 seconds of arc
relative to the origin of the manuscript. If ^*NEXT<CR>\* is now given you
will be positioned on the end of the first accuracy region.

.P 0;Using ^*NEXT<CR>\* repeatedly as detailed above will allow the 
second accuracy region to be similarly examined. Repeat the command until
the end of layer 0 (an EO entry) is encountered.

.P 0;Type ^*NO<CR>\* to positioned on the next layer in the IFF file, and then
use ^*NEXT<CR>\* repeatedly to examine a number of the DFAD features present
in the layer. When positioned on a FS entry note that a feature now has a
feature code that is a combination of the feature type and feature identifier.
 The formula used to generate the feature code is: 
.NOFILL
.BL
^*FC = FID + ((type+1) _* 1000)\*
.BL
.FILL
Note that all features now have an AC entry of type 7, and that the analysis
data has been transferred from the FADT feature records to the text field of
this AC.  Compare the listing of the FADT produced during FADTINPUT acceptance
with the AC records.  If data for DFAD features 6008, 6009 and 6010 was
entered during FADTINPUT acceptance, these features may be specifically
examined. For example to examine feature 6008 type ^*NF 6008<CR>\* followed by
a series of ^*NEXT<CR>\* commands. Type ^*EXIT<CR>\* to exit from IPATCH. 

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;The DFAD module MCEHED is used to interactively examine and edit fields
in a MCE IFF Map Header.  For acceptance, the file generated by FADTMERGE
will be used.  The majority of fields relevant to a DFAD manuscript, for
example the coverage and overall accuracy of the manuscript, have been set
by FADTMERGE from information contained in the FADT.

.P 0;Once the prompt MCEHED> has been displayed, type ^*SHOW ALL<CR>\* to
examine all the fields in the Map Header. Specific groups of fields may be
examined by giving the command SHOW followed by a group name. Type
^*SHOW COVERAGE<CR>\* to examine just those fields relating to the manuscript
origin and corners. If a listing of the FADT records has been produced as part
of FADTINPUT acceptance, you should compare these values with the values in
the FADT header record. Type ^*SHOW ACCURACY<CR>\* to examine the overall
accuracy of the manuscript, and compare with the manuscript accuracy values
on the FADTINPUT listing.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;MCEHED may also be used to edit a Map Header field.  This is done by
typing the name of the field, and supplying a new field value. The new value
may be specified on the same line as the field name, or in response to a
prompt on the terminal.  For acceptance the manuscript compilation date will
be set. First type ^*SHOW HISTORY<CR>\* to examine the current compilation
date (^*CDTE\*). In the acceptance file this is still unset. Type ^*CDTE 31 5
88 <CR>\* and the compilation date will be set to 31-May-1988. Type just
^*CDTE<CR>\* and you will be prompted for a date.  Note that the data format
DD-MMM-YY may also be used - type ^*30-Jun-88<CR>\* and the compilation date
will be set to 30-Jun-1988.  The format of the date stored in the Map Header
is the format required in the DLMS Specification. 

.P 0;To save the edit just performed on the IFF file, type ^*EXIT<CR>\*.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;The DFAD module DFADVAL is used to validate the MCE Map Header data, the
geometry and attributes of DFAD accuracy regions, and the geometry and
analysis attributes of DFAD point, line and area features. In a production
flowline DFADVAL should be run on a DFAD IFF file before writing the
data to a DFAD format magnetic tape.  Errors detected by DFADVAL should
be corrected, depending on the nature of the error, using FADTINPUT,
MCEHED or the LITES2 cartographic editor.

.P 0;Geometric checks such as whether area features are defined anticlockwise;
feature coordinates fall within the manuscript bounds, and whether features
have any crossing segments are performed. Checks on the FAC order of DFAD
features, and gaps in the FAC sequence are made, as well as checks on whether
the analysis values held in the AC 7 entry of a DFAD feature are all present,
and are valid for the type of feature. If the /RULES qualifier is specified
the analysis codes are also validated against entries in a DLMS Rules File. 

.P 0;For acceptance, all categories of checks will be performed by DFADVAL. If
acceptance succeeds only messages relating to the number of the first feature
in each layer, breaks in sequence numbering, and the total number of features
in a layer should be reported on the terminal. 

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;Acceptance for the two DFAD tape modules I2DFAD and DFAD2I is performed
together, since DFAD2I is used to verify that the DFAD format tape has been
correctly written by I2DFAD.  In order to carry out acceptance, a magnetic
tape should be loaded on a tape device. This should be a scratch tape as
I2DFAD will overwrite any existing data on the tape. You will be asked to
supply the tape device name as part of acceptance.  Note that the tape
should be loaded but not mounted.

.P 0;I2DFAD is used to transfer DFAD data held in an IFF file to a DFAD format
magnetic tape.  The format of this tape is detailed in the DMA DLMS
Specification. I2DFAD will be run twice in order to transfer data from 2 IFF
files - the first of these files is the IFF file generated by FADTMERGE.  In
the first run, the tape is initialised, so that the data is written as the
first manuscript.  In the second run, the tape is rewound and the data is
appended to the tape after the previous manuscript.  Note that as part of this
operation, DFAD2I performs checks to ensure that the second manuscript
is correctly geographically positioned in relation to the first manuscript. 
Diagnostics will be enabled so that the progress of the IFF to DFAD data
transfer may be monitored. 

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;An opportunity to confirm the structure of the DFAD tape using the
DUMP utility, is offered as part of acceptance. If selected, a DUMP of
the first 4 blocks of the tape will be output to the terminal.  Block
1 is a manuscript header record of 27 bytes (6 36 bit words). Block
2 is a DataSet Identification (DSI) of 648 bytes length, and records
in ASCII data extracted from the Map Header of the IFF file.  Block 3
is an Accuracy (ACC) record of 2700 bytes length, and records in ASCII
accuracy region data extracted from layer 0 of the IFF file. Block 4
is a feature record of length 2709 bytes (602 36 bit words) holding
in binary format the DFAD feature geometry and analysis data.

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;DFAD2I is used to convert data from DFAD format magnetic tape to IFF
file. DFAD2I will be run twice in order to transfer the two manuscripts on the
tape. In the first run, the /MANUSCRIPT=1 qualifier is specified to select the
first manuscript on the tape.  In the second run, the tape is rewound, and the
/LATITUDE and /LONGITUDE qualifiers are used to search for the second
manuscript on the basis of manuscript origin. In both cases the /DIAGNOSTICS
qualifier is specified so that the tape to disk conversion process may be
monitored. 

.BLANK;.RIGHT;^*Pass#[#]/Fail#[#]\*

.P 0;To confirm that the data has been correctly read from tape, the IMP
utility IDIFFERENCE may be used to compare the files generated by DFAD2I
with the original files.  If file transfer has been correctly performed
the only differences should be in the IFF History (HI) entry, and NS entry,
and in the Map Header (MH) entry since not all header fields are stored
on the DFAD format tape.  There should be no differences reported in the
IFF feature coordinates or analysis codes.
