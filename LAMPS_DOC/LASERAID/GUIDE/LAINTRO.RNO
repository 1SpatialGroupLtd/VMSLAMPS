.HL 1 ^&Objective of this guide\&
.P
This introductory guide is designed to train new operators the method of
digitising map data with the Laser-Scan Lasertrak semi-automatic digitiser.  
It assumes the user to be a novice operator with some cartographic skills 
and explains basic system operation in step-by-step procedures.  Most 
descriptions are limited to those essential for basic system operation.
A full description of Lasertrak features and commands can be found in the 
"Laseraid Reference Manual".

.HL1 ^&Introduction\&
.P
The Laser-Scan Lasertrak is a semi-automated line-following digitiser for the 
mass conversion of line drawings into digital form.  It performs the 
conversion under the guidance of an operator who directs the system to each 
line for digitising and who intervenes with appropriate feature coding and 
assistance when required.  Actual line digitising is performed automatically 
and is achieved with minimum operator intervention in most cases.

.P
The Lasertrak system is based on the same hardware configuration as is being 
used in Laser-Scan's High Resolution Display device (HRD-1).  Readers are 
referred to the HRD technical manuals for details of the hardware 
configuration and software interface.

.P
The source documents for digitising on Lasertrak are film negatives which are 
photographic reductions of the original source drawings.  The film negative is 
of standard A6 microfiche size (148mm x 105mm).  This source image is inserted 
into the optics unit of the Lasertrak on the film negative holder and thence 
the image for digitising is back-projected on to the large format display 
screen for interpretation by the operator.  Though all scanning is carried out 
on the fiche-size negatives, the operator can observe all digitising and 
software decisions on the enlarged projection of the display screen.

.P
The digital data generated by the Lasertrak are placed directly into a linear 
(vector) form as though they had originated from a manual digitising table.  
All digital lines (including curves) are represented as straight line segments 
between two digitised coordinates.  Clearly, lines of extreme curvature have 
considerably more coordinates than straight lines:  two end-points are used 
to demarcate and fix the latter case.

.P
The system of coordinates that is generated by the Lasertrak is selected by 
the operator during the machine set-up stage.  The target coordinates of four 
known control points are provided to the system which then ensures 
that all subsequent digitising is performed in relation to the same coordinate 
space.

.P
The representation of line features is also defined by the operator who is 
able to direct the laser cursor along appropriate routes during digitising and 
determine the feature start and end locations, its attribute code and so on.

.P
The name given to the controlling software which drives the Lasertrak during 
digitising is LASERAID.  This is the program which runs on the 
Digital VAX and MicroVax series of computers and which converse with the 
Lasertrak hardware to produce the automatic line-following capabilities of 
the system. This manual describes the nature of the Laseraid program and the 
basic facilities it provides for the operator during digitising. There are three
main methods of line following that can be used with Laseraid and these 
include normal line-following (both solid, continuous lines or dashed lines), 
extended line-following with junction recognition capability and finally 
edge-following mode to digitise, for example, the outer periphery of colour 
mask sources.

.HL1 ^&Components of the Lasertrak System\&
.P
The five diagrams which follow show the components of the Lasertrak system.
Diagram A shows the whole of Lasertrak with pointers to the locations of 
key control panels which operators should be aware of.  These panels are
referenced by the letters B-E, which corresponds to the titles used for
the four close-up diagrams which follow diagram A.
.P
A summary of the five component diagrams is given below.

.P 
A convention has been used in this document so that each control switch on
each panel is labelled uniquely. This reference system is used throughout in
the text descriptions which follow. Thus, the reference  (*C23) used within
the text refers to diagram C, control switch number 23 - in this case, it is the
photo-chromic clamp switch.

.HL1 ^&Photography Considerations for Film Negative Production\&

.HL 2 ^&Choice of Documents\&

.P; To digitise a map accurately the source document must be on a stable based 
transparent or translucent film.  Source documents on paper are equally able 
to be digitised but operators should be aware of accuracy limitations.

.P; Before photographing, it must be decided to what reduction factor the film 
negative will be made for the map; this depends on the size of the map, the 
widths of the line-work, the strength in density of the lines and the 
complexity of the detail on the map.  The Lasertrak projects the source 
negative at a 10X enlargement on the photochromic screen, so if photographed 
at less than 10X reduction factor the map will be larger on screen than the 
original.  This is recommended to aid the Lasertrak operator and also as a 
starting point on deciding the reduction factor necessary.

.HL 2 ^&Considerations of Line Quality\&

.P; The ideal line for Lasertrak is one which is crisp and black with a clear
background.  However, within certain limitations, the Lasertrak can also handle
lower quality source data and operators will quickly appreciate by experience
its capabilities. 

.P; The diagram below may help:  it gives some example enlargements of a line 
showing various possible densities

.BL 15

.HL 2 ^&Linewidth Specifications\&

.P; The minimum linewidth required for digitising is 0.03mm (0.0012 in.) on the
reduced negative, the maximum is 0.3mm (0.012 in), and  the optimum is about
0.04mm on the source negative. 

.HL 2 ^&Film Negative Size and its Relationship with Source Documents\&

.P; The film negative should be 105mm wide, 148mm long.  The digitising area 
is placed centrally as shown in the diagram below.

.BL 15

.P; The exposure should have an optical density of approximately 0D1.  
Laser-Scan recommends Kodak ON4 film.

.P; The digitising region on the map must be reduced to fit the area on the 
negatives as shown above.  Some examples follow which show the size of the map 
and the reduction factor necessary.

.FILL

.P; If the map is too big to be reduced within x10 reduction factor or if it
can not meet the linewidth requirement, then it needs to be photographed in
sections so that more than one film negative is produced for each map.  This
also applies if the map is too complex and needs a low reduction factor to
define the lines clearly on the negative.  If there is a gap between two lines
to be digitised of at least 0.4mm on the screen then it will be possible for
the machine to follow all lines.  Some examples below show some typical 
Laser-Scan experiences. 

.BL 15

.HL 2 ^&Pre-Photography Enhancement and Map Definition\&
.HL 3 ^&Control Points\&

.P; Each full map (or each sub-division if it is necessary to digitise a map 
in portions) must have four clear control points.  These must have at least the 
same line qualities as the lines which comprise the map data.  It is sometimes 
an advantage to draw the control points outside the edge of the data to help 
the Lasertrak to locate them but is not crucial.

.BL 15

.P; There follows some examples which, show the required location of control
points for maps which are to be digitised in portions.

.BL 15

.HL 3 ^&Photography Reference Marks\&

.P; It is an advantage to always mark on the map an upward pointing  arrow
prior to photography.  Clearly this should not obscure data to be digitised and
aids operators in ensuring correct film orientation when it is placed into the
Lasertrak.  In general, the arrow should always be made to point so that it is 
aligned along the shortest map axis to enable the effective use of the maximum
reduction factor possible. 

.BL 15

.P; Also marked on the map should be a reference name and a small opaque block 
(approx. one inch square) which will be used within Lasertraks check made for 
machine tuning - see section 9.4.

.P; Examples of these additions are shown below.

.BL 8

.HL 2 ^&Calibration Grids for Each Batch of Photography\&

.P; Always, when photographing a new batch of negatives, a square grid is also
photographed to enable  Lasertrak calibration for this batch.  The grid should
have a pitch of 2cm or 4cm squares (1 or 2 inches).  The grid should also have 
an arrow and an opaque block as previously explained in pre-photography
enhancements (section 4.5.2).  Use of this calibration grid negative is
essential and details of machine calibration are given in section 9.5. 
It is also essential that the calibration grid is photographed in exactly
the same position and orientation as the map data photography. It is futile
to take map data photography in one orientation and take a photograph
of the calibration grid in a totally different orientation; this results
in total loss of registration when measuring the distortions inherent
in the camera lens.

.HL 2 ^&Photographic Stage\&

.HL 3 ^&Positioning on Photographic Table for Film Maps\&

.P; First of all position the map on the photographic bed so that the North 
arrow is pointing upwards and the map text is forward reading.  Flip the map 
over so that the text becomes reverse reading and then rotate it through 90 
degrees so that the upward arrow in now pointing to the right.  Notice that in 
both the start position and the final position the lower left control remains as 
the same negative control point.

.BL 15

.P; The quickest way to achieve correct orientation is to move the bottom 
right hand corner of the map to the top left.  This procedure is copied for 
the grids.
.BR; N.B.  It is recommended to position the digitising area of the map as 
centrally as possible.

.HL 3 ^&Film Negative Exposure\&

.P; We have now reached the stage where we have marked up the maps and 
positioned them onto the photographic bed.  The camera should then itself be 
moved to the required settings to give the reduction factor which has been 
decided.  It is ^&CRUCIAL\& that the camera is ^&NOT\& moved again until the 
photographic session (or batch) is complete.  The photographic exposures of 
each map in the batch and the standard grid can now be made.

.P; Laser-Scan always takes at least three different exposures of each map and 
grid thereby giving the Lasertrak operator a choice of exposures from which 
the best can be selected.  Before doing a large batch it is a good idea to 
take several test exposures first to try to determine the best setting for the 
Lasertrak.  Once the best exposure has been decided the full batch can be 
made.

.P; Use side and back lighting on the camera for the best results.

.HL 3 ^&Paper Maps:  Some Minor Differences\&

.P; We do not recommend using paper maps for accuracy reasons, though in some 
cases it can not be avoided.  The only difference in using paper is in the 
positioning on the photographic bed:  all other procedures should be following 
exactly as before.

.P; When positioning paper on the photographic bed rotate the map through 90
degrees without turning it over e.g. 

.BL 15

.P; The grid should be positioned exactly the same as was used for the paper 
described above.  Only use side lights on the camera for paper maps.

.Hl 2 ^&Preparation of Film Negatives for Entry into the Lasertrak\&

.P; Once the photography has been completed and developed successfully, each 
negative should be cut so that it fits neatly into the Lasertrak film carrier. 
 Section 4.4 describes the details of film size.


.BL 2
The following sections (5-11) describe the operations necessary to use the 
Lasertrak for digitising.  Details are given on setting-up the hardware from 
cold and also the various stages and modes of software operation.

.PAGE

.HL1 ^&System Hardware Start-up Procedures\&

.P
The instructions which follow explain the procedures necessary to start-up the 
Lasertrak hardware; they assume that the system is currently switched off with 
no power being supplied to either the projection system or the lasers.  
Confirmation that the system is in this off state is provided by the following 
symptoms:
.BL 2

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"
.LE; Master power-lock key in off, vertical position (*B9)

.LE; Orange photochromic display (*A2) extinguished:  note other machine states can produce 
similar symptoms - see details on diazo plotting and main shutter switch under 
section 5.1.
.LE; Water cooling unit and water supply should also be switched off.
.END LIST

.P
The procedure to power-up Lasertrak from cold involves following a series of 
steps in sequence as are described below.
.BR
.I5
.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"
.LE; Switch on water supply for the laser cooling system
.LE; Turn clockwise to horizontal the master power-lock key on Lasertrak main 
panel (*B9)
.LE; Depress green master on/off button to power-up machine:  confirmation is 
given by green illumination of this button (*B10).
.LE; Confirm that machine status is on-line by adjusting the 'M/C STATUS' 
switch to its on-line position (*B11).

.END LIST

.P
The Lasertrak is now in a powered-up state confirmed by the illumination of 
the green power-on light (*B10).  Under normal circumstances, further 
confirmation of 
this switched-on state will be the appearance of the orange colour to the 
photochromic
display screen; this will start to appear after about thirty seconds and will 
reach full brightness within five minutes.

.END LITERAL

.HL 1 ^&Loading of Source Negatives For Digitising\&

.P
Lasertrak digitises its line work from 105mm source negatives as produced at
the photography stage (see section 4).  These documents should be placed with
correct orientation into the negative carrier (*E32) for insertion to the optics
unit of the Lasertrak.  The negative loading procedure is described in detail
below. 
.BL2
.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"
.LE; Check that the correct negative is available and select that with the 
best contrast of dark and light if several negatives are available.

.LE; Set the photo-chromic clamp switch on Lasertrak's engineers panel to open 
(PC clamp switch to upward position) (*C23).

.LE; Open the door of the optics unit by rotating the key anti-clockwise 
(clockwise on Fastraks) and pulling open the door (*A3).

.LE; Unclamp the negative carrier by moving the zone plate clamp to the left 
(E34).

.LE; Withdraw the negative carrier from the optics unit by sliding it out 
through the door.  ENSURE THAT THE CARRIER DOES NOT FOUL THE PHOTOCHROMIC FILM 
DURING THIS OPERATION.  Careful withdrawal can obviate this problem.

.LE; Remove existing negative from the holder if present.

.LE; Check that the film holder is clean and free from dust and greasy 
finger prints.

.LE; Hold the new source negative so that it is the correct way up (with text 
reading correctly).  Rotate it so that the negative is still the correct way 
up but with the text reversed.  Laser-Scan suggest that user's include an 
arrow pointing upwards on all Lasertrak photography to provide easy reference 
of negative orientation (see Section 4.5.2).

.LE; Place the negative on to the negative carrier and slip it under the 
spring loaded edges.  Take care not to mark the glass with dirty fingers.

.PAGE

.LE; Replace the negative carrier complete with negative in the optics unit, 
ensuring that the glass side of the carrier is pointing towards the rear of 
the Lasertrak (i.e. towards the orange projection bulb) and the negative side 
is positioned adjacent to the photochromic film.

.LE; Re-engage the zone plate clamp by sliding the lever to the right to 
fasten the negative carrier in place. (*E32).
.LE; Close the door of the optics unit and lock it by pushing firmly and 
rotating the key clockwise (anti-clockwise on Fastraks) (*A3).

.LE; Re-position the photochromic clamp switch on the engineers panel to 
closed (PC clamp switch to downward position) (*C23).
.END LIST

.P
The negative is now in position and operators can begin to invoke software 
procedures necessary to digitise linework from it.  Note that the negative 
should be projected clearly on to the Lasertrak display screen with all control
points and drawing extremes visible.  If the image is not completely visible
then readjust the position of the negative in the carrier until the complete 
image can be seen on the display screen.

.PAGE

.HL 1 ^&COMMENCING A COMPUTER SESSION FOR DIGITISING\&:

.HL 2 ^&The Login Procedure\&

.P
The Lasertrak system connects to a standard Digital Equipment VAX and
MicroVax series of 
computers running a version of the standard VMS (or MicroVMS) 
operating system.  Before any 
digitising session can commence, the operator must first log on to the VMS 
system at the Lasertrak close-up terminal.  Readers are referred to the 
collection of manuals on VMS produced by Digital Equipment for the detailed 
command structure and facilities.

.P
Basic login is achieved by prompting the attention of the computer and 
supplying a valid user's code and password.  Prompting the attention of the 
computer is achieved by hitting the <return> key slowly several times.  
Successful connection is confirmed by the command.
.BL 2
.CENTRE; USERNAME:
.P 
The operator replies with a valid user code (hitting return to signify 
completion of typing).  On the command
.BL 2
.CENTRE; PASSWORD:
.BL 2
the operator types in the valid security code (which is not displayed on the 
screen) and successful completion will be confirmed with a report of the 
version of VMS currently installed and the VMS prompt symbol:
.BL 2 
.CENTRE; $
.P
The dollar symbol '$' is the standard VMS prompt and signifies to the user 
that the computer is at DCL command level (This can be considered the
stage when the operating system can accept commands in the
Digital Control Language known as 'DCL').  At this stage, any legal DCL command 
or appropriate Laser-Scan command can be entered as required.

.HL 2 ^&The SI and SD Commands\&

.HL 3 ^&Basic Use\&
.P
A basic digitising session on Lasertrak first involves the operator directing 
VMS to the appropriate file directory into which will be placed the digitised 
vector coordinates.  All files of digitising have by default the file 
extension '.IFF' to their names.  IFF stands for Internal Feature File and is 
Laser-Scan file structure generated by the Lasertrak and other Laser-Scan 
mapping systems.  Specifying the appropriate target directory in which to 
place the IFF file is achieved with the Laser-Scan command SI ('set IFF 
directory').  This command is given in response to the VMS ($) 
prompt and may take the form 
.BL 2
.CENTRE; SI file directory
.CENTRE; e.g. SI DRA2:[BUREAU.COASTLINE]
.P
The command is not mandatory but is advisable for effective file handling on 
VMS.  Failure to include the 'SI' command prior to digitising will result in 
the IFF files being generated in a default directory with logical name
LSL$IF:.
.P
Users should also note a complementary Laser-Scan command 'SD' which directs 
VMS to the user's default directory on which can be run standard VMS commands.  
Typical use of the command may take the form
.BL 2
.CENTRE; SD file directory
.CENTRE;  e.g. SD DRA2:[BUREAU.COASTLINE].

.HL 3 ^&The SI and SD Commands - Advanced Use\&

.P
There are a number of extensions to the SI and SD commands in which 
abbreviations can reduce considerably the amount of typing required.  The list 
below with 'SD' and 'SI' compares the command syntax necessary with standard 
VMS equivalents.

.NOFILL
.KEEP

SD
.CENTRE; Set/Show the default directory

Examples:		Equivalent to:

Users are referred to Digital Equipment VMS manual volume 2A for details of 
the SET DEFAULT command.

.HL 2 ^&Initialisation of the Lasertrak Display and Digitising Laser\&

.P
Before users can invoke the Lasertrak digitising software, it is
first necessary to initialise the scanning hardware.  This is achieved by issuing 
two Laser-Scan commands in reponse to the VMS prompt.  The first command takes the 
form:
.BL 2
.CENTRE; ^*SETHRD\*  (which can be abbreviated to SETH)
.P
This initialises the large screen display and re-sets various parameters in 
the system.  Note that this command will also return the device to 
photochromic mode if it is currently in diazo mode.  Confirmation of the 
successful completion of this operation is achieved with the appearance of the 
orange display screen and all function buttons extinguished.  Operators should
not confuse or mistype SETHRD (abbreviated to SETH) as 'SET H' since this
is a standard VMS/DCL command 'SET HOST' which performs rather different
functions not discussed here. Note also that the SETHRD 
command (even in its correct form) is unable to complete 
successfully if the Lasertrak is off-line to the 
computer.  In such an event, the following warning message will persist until 
the device is switched on-line.
.BL 2

.I5; 'FASTRAK OFF-LINE - PLEASE SWITCH ON-LINE'
.P
The Lasertrak is switched on-line by raising (or rotating) the 'M/C STATUS' 
switch (*B11) on the 
main control panel to the on-line position from the downward off-line 
position.

.P
The second initialising command for Lasertrak digitising takes the form:
.BL 2 
.CENTRE; ^*COL RED\*
.P
This invokes the red laser for refresh mode in Lasertrak.  Failure to use 'COL 
RED' may result in an inappropriate initialisation of the Lasertrak for 
digitising.  The default option (i.e. no use of 'COL RED') is to use the blue 
refresh laser rather than red.  Generally it is advisable to use
the red refresh laser while digitising.  Both the SETHRD and COL RED 
commands are mandatory at least once during a digitising session, although often
a standard command file is provided to do this when the user logs in.

.HL 1 ^&INVOKING LASERAID FOR DIGITISING\&

.HL 2 ^&Introduction\&

.P
Laseraid is the name of the controlling software used by the Lasertrak 
hardware for digitising.  Its operation requires the following information to 
be available before the session commences:
.BL 2
.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"
.LE; Is the session starting a new map or is it adding to a file that has 
already started on a previous session?

.LE; What is the name of the file into which the digitised line work is 
going to be placed?

.LE; What is the name of the Lasertrak parameter file for this job and has it 
been calibrated? 

.END LIST

.HL 2 ^&Overview of the Laseraid Run Command\&

.P
The command string necessary to invoke Laseraid is given in response to the VMS
prompt.
It consists of the Laseraid startup command and two parameters; all 
of which are mandatory with options to include additional keywords for other 
facilities.  The command and two parameters (plus optional keywords) are 
typed on a single line and terminated by carriage return:  they are separated
by one or more spaces. It is recommended that the order in which the 
parameters are specified is adhered to for routine production work.
.BL 2

Command:
.LM+14;^*LAJ\*  this acronym stands for Lines, Area-features and Junctions.
.LM-14
.BL 2

Parameter 1:
.LM+14; typically takes one of two keywords (though there are others - 
see Reference Manual) which defines the current status of digitising for 
the current file in question, these two keywords are:

.BL 2;

^*IFF\*   
.LITERAL
          -   Specifies that this  digitising session is opening a
              new file of output for the first time.
.END LITERAL
.BL 2;
^*OLD\*   
.LITERAL
          -   Specifies that digitising has already been started
              in a previous session and the current session will
              be adding to the work created previously.

.END LITERAL
.LM-14
.BL 2

Parameter 2:
.LM+14; is the file name into which the digitised output from Lasertrak is to 
be placed.  It must follow parameter 2 above.  The file name is given either 
with or without a three character VMS file extension.  File names given 
without an extension are assumed to have the suffix '.IFF'.  File names given 
with an extension preserve this extension in the output file name.
.BL 2

.NOFILL

     e.g.     FRED                 producing FRED.IFF
              BERT.IFF             producing BERT.IFF
              TONY.DIG             producing TONY.DIG

.FILL
.BL 2; If the keyword 'OLD' was supplied for parameter 1, it is essential 
that the file name given in parameter 2 already exists in the current IFF 
target directory.

.LM-14
.BL 2
.NOFILL
NON MANDATORY COMMANDS:
.BL 2;
Parameter filename specifier
.BL;
.FILL
.LM+14; By default, Laseraid will call up LNK.LAJ as the parameter file 
which Laseraid will use to control its performance in digitising for the 
current map.  The parameter file (sometimes called the 'patch' file) will
often change according to the nature of the digitising production to be
undertaken. Therefore a different 'patch' file may need to be assigned.
Basic operators need not be totally conversant with the parameter file 
and merely need to know its name and status of calibration for the current 
batch of source photography.

.BL 2; The names of parameter files follow normal VMS conventions . File 
extension comprises of up to three characters and is by default .LAJ . 
It is recommended that the default naming convention is adhered to for 
easy reference, although  it is possible to specify alternative naming 
conventions.

.BL 2; Note that all parameter files for Laseraid are expected by the software 
to be found in the directory with the logical name:
.BL
.CENTRE; LSL$LK:

.BL 2; In order to specify a 'patch' file in the command line, the 
following keyword must be entered before the patch filename. 

.BL
.CENTRE; ^*WITH\* 'patch filename'

.LM+14;The photochromic film will be wound on one frame automatically
when Laseraid is invoked
.LM-14
.BL 2
Contour elevation specifier
.BL 2
^*HTD###HTI\*
.BL 2
.LM+14;The commands 'HTD' or 'HTI' (optionally followed by a numeric argument)
may be specified to instruct Laseraid of the desired method of coding for
heighting (or elevation) data in contour digitising.  The mnemonic 'HTI' forces 
coding to be restricted to integer coding only and the codes placed in IFF as
a type 2 Ancillary Code (for integer contours).  Typical examples of integer 
coding includes 3003, -36, 27, 295.

.P; The mnemonic 'HTD' forces coding to use the decimal option for the coding
of elevations; these will be placed in IFF as a type 3 Ancillary Code (for real 
contours).  Users are referred to the descriptions of the IFF structure which 
is given in the IFF user's guide.  Particular reference should 
be made to IFF ACs (ancillary coding).

.P; The optional numeric value which follows 'HTI' or 'HTD' initialises the 
elevation datum to that value.  Increment or decrement of this elevation datum
is achieved by functions buttons whilst digitising (see section 10.3.1 para k).

.P; The default method of coding elevations without the use of 'HTD' or 'HTI' 
is to use the feature serial number entry in the IFF file (the NF number - see 
IFF reference manual). More detail of using Laseraid in
either normal 'feature' mode or special 'height' mode is given in sections
10.2.1 and 10.2.2

.LM-14

.P; There now follows several examples of the command strings necessary to 
invoke Laseraid.

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",RL,")"
.LE; ^*LAJ IFF FRED\*
.BL2; invokes Laseraid for a new file to be called FRED.IFF in the current 
IFF target directory using the default laseraid parameter file LSL$LK:LNK.LAJ

.LE; ^*LAJ OLD ROCKVILLE\*
.BL 2; invokes Laseraid to continue digitising into the file ROCKVILLE.IFF 
using the default parameter file LSL$LK:LNK.LAJ

.LE; ^*LAJ IFF N22631NW WITH 056141\*

.BL 2; invokes Laseraid to start new file called N22631NW.IFF 
using parameter file LSL$LK:056141.LAJ

.LE; ^*LAJ OLD TEMP.123 WITH TEST.ABC\*

.BL 2; invokes Laseraid to continue digitising into file TEMP.123 with 
parameter file LSL$LK:TEST.ABC.

.LE; ^*LAJ IFF EVEREST WITH LNK122 HTD 300.5\*

.BL 2; invokes Laseraid to digitise into a new file 'EVEREST.IFF' using 
parameter file LSL$LK:LNK122.LAJ.  Decimal heights are to 
be coded with the start (initial base) being 300.5 units.

.HL 1 ^&PREPARATION OF LASERAID FOR DIGITISING\&

.HL 2 ^&Overview\&

.BL; Laseraid divides naturally into three stages.  
.BL2;
STAGE 1
.LM+14
.BL2;
The first stage is where various necessary machine parameters and system 
calibrations are set-up.  It includes the measurement of a standard grid 
and the control points, and input of operator identification details,
feature coding schemes to be used and so on. See section 9 

.LM-14
.BL2;
STAGE 2
.LM+14
.BL2;

This is the stage in which the feature (an edge,line or symbol) to be digitised 
is selected and any extra details such as its code and hierarchical level 
(layer) is supplied. See section 10

.LM-14
.BL2;
STAGE 3
.LM+14
.BL2;

This is the actual scanning process:  here, measurements which are 
determined by Lasertrak produce digitised coordinates to represent linear 
features in a numeric, vector form.  See Section 10.3 and 10.4
.BL; The results generated during stage three can be either accepted, or 
rejected if errors have been made.  In any event, the program will return to 
stage two for the selection and coding of the next feature.  A typical 
digitising session will then comprise alternating between stages two and three 
until the work is complete when the 'end-of-session' command 'EOS' is given to 
terminate the Laseraid program and return the operator to VMS main mode.

.LM-14
.PAGE

.HL 2 ^&Laseraid Introductory Messages and Start-Up\&

.P; Once Laseraid has been invoked successfully (as described in Section 8) 
there are four confirmation messages.  The first gives the version of 
laseraid which is implemented, the second confirms the designated 
parameter (or 'patch') file, the third confirms the destination IFF file, and 
the fourth confirms successful initialisation.  For example, the following 
command string
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*LAJ##IFF##FRED##WITH##PATCH.116\*
.BL; might produce
.BL
.NOFILL

     Laseraid [LAJ] of 11:28:36   01-Jun-1986
     LSL$LK:PATCH.116;0
     LSL$IF:FRED.IFF
     Initialisation completed

.FILL
.BL
line 1 gives the current version of Laseraid being run
.BR; lines 2 and 3 confirm the parameter file and target output file being 
used and the statement 'Initialisation completed' is the final response to 
confirm that Laseraid has started correctly and is awaiting a command from the 
operator.

.PAGE

.HL 2 ^&Laseraid Command Structure and User Interface\&

.P; Commands are supplied by the operator to the program via the function 
buttons (FBs) and the close-up screen keyboard.  In general, the most common 
commands at any time are available on the function buttons, whilst less common 
commands (and those requiring numbers or text as arguments) are given via the 
close-up screen keyboard.  All commands available on the function buttons at 
any time are equally available  via the keyboard and are given as their three character mnemonic 
names.  Typing the command "?" at the keyboard at any time when a command is 
expected will print out all the commands available (both on the function 
buttons and the close-up keyboard).  Typing "??" will provide a summary of all
the Laseraid commands available in the current mode, whilst "?#command" will 
give an explanation of that command.

.P; Laseraid does not give operators any prompt character (as does VMS, for 
example, with its dollar sign).  However, the function buttons have the 
ability to light-up and extinguish to show both program status and the availability 
of options at any one time.

.HL 3 ^&Function Button Commands\&
.P; A function button numbering system (*D30) is used throughout Laser-Scan 
documentation and this is explained below

.P; In general, only those function buttons which have relevance in a 
particular stage of the Laseraid program are illuminated.  The meaning of some 
buttons do change in different modes of the program, though some preserve the 
same meaning throughout; FB16 is an example of this latter case as it always 
means ABAndon, which is the failure exit, returning the operator to the previous 
level and undoing as much as possible as it goes.  FB4 is usually ACCept, 
which is the successful completion.  Other buttons are used for commands
specific to that 
program level.  The extra commands are positioned so that the pattern of 
function button lights is easily recognisable for each level, and this will
become relevant in subsequent sections of this manual.

.HL 3 ^&Keyboard Commands\&

.P; Commands at the keyboard are recognised by their first three letters, 
hence ABA is sufficient for the ABANDON command.  Those commands requiring 
either a numeric or a text argument should have the complete details typed on 
the same line.  A full summary of Laseraid commands is given in the Laseraid 
Reference Manual: they are listed also in Appendix A of this manual.

.PAGE

.HL 2 ^&Initialisation Stage\&

.P; Once Laseraid has been invoked successfully (and the statement 
'Initialisation completed' is given on the close-up screen), the program enters 
the main mode level.  This is the basic level of Laseraid from which all 
subsequent modes are entered to perform specific tasks.  More details on Main 
Mode level are given in section 10.3; confirmation of Main Mode Level is given 
by the pattern of function button lights as shown below:

.P; The first procedure advisable once Laseraid has been started is to 
determine and confirm that the scanning hardware is reading the source map 
correctly.  To perform this tuning, the operator should enter 'check mode' 
which is achieved by typing the three character mnemonic
.BL

.CENTRE; ^*CHK######\*<return>

on the close-up screen keyboard whilst in main mode.

.P;The major other commands available in check mode from the close-up

circumstances, there are only a few additional commands with which basic 
operators should be familiar; these are listed below:
.BL 2
.NOFILL
     TYP#n######select a particular line type
     PSP########print scanner parameters
.FILL

.P; Other commands may be manipulated to tune the 
Lasertrak on each occasion that a new series of maps is to be digitised.  
This detailed tuning need only be carried out once for a map series and it 
is advisable that this be performed by a competent system manager.

.P; Details on Lasertrak tuning are given in the Lasertrak Reference Manual.

.HL 3 ^&Procedures in CHK Mode\&

.P; In most cases, the abridged summary of commands shown above (in
section 9.4) are all that basic operators need to be aware of when they wish to start a 
digitising session.  A detailed description of the procedures necessary
for machine 
tuning follows with a brief, repeat summary of all the actions necessary at 
the end.

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",ll,")"
.LE; The operator should scan the document to be digitised visually as it is 
being displayed on the photochromic display and select one or a series of line 
portions which are considered to be representative of the whole map.  He 
should then show to Laseraid his choice of line; this portion of line need be 
no longer than about 0.25 - 0.4 inches in length.  The STArt command (FB1) is 
used to show laseraid where his choice of line (or vector) begins.  The 
operator should steer the laser cursor cross with the trackerball to the start 
of the line portion and depress FB1 to issue a STArt command to Laseraid.  The 
effect that this will have is to anchor a start point on the test line.

.LE; The operator then shows Laseraid where his test line portion should end - 
remember to keep its length to about 0.3 inches.  To do this, he moves the 
laser cursor gently along the test line to a new position 0.25 - 0.4 inches 
away from the anchor point defined in (a) above.

.LE; Stages (a) and (b) above have now defined the start and end position of a 
short vector to be used to tune certain parameters which Lasertrak needs to be 
able to follow lines automatically.  Now this test portion has been defined it 
need not be re-defined unless the operator wishes to repeat the exercise on 
other test portions.  There are three basic parameters which should be tuned 
with this test portion of line; these are the Phase (PHA), the threshold (THR) 
and the focus (FOC).  These procedures are explained in stages (d) to (f) 
below.

.LE; The focus is the first parameter that should be tuned under normal 
circumstances, ^&but this can only be achieved successfully by first providing 
an arbitrarily high threshold setting\&.

.P; To set a high threshold, the operator depresses FB9 to issue a THReshold 
command to Laseraid.  This command causes the Lasertrak to scan across the 
test line and produce a graph and cross-hairs on the close-up screen.  Typical 
examples could be as shown below
.BL 2; Examples
.BL 16



.P; The graphs serve to show the operator a visual representation of what the 
Lasertrak has seen as it scans ^&across\& the test line from one edge to the 
other.  Thus, diagram (i) is a good scan - the plateau peak represents a clear 
white line with well defined edges.  Diagram (ii) is equally acceptable since 
a plateau is evident; the uncharacteristic peak to the left is probably due to 
some noise also detected by the scanner or fluctuations in the black
areas of the negative.  Diagram (iii) is rather more alarming; 
there is no clear plateau which suggests that the line being scanned has a 
poor contrast quality or is on the limits of minimum line-width for 
line-following.  Operators are advised that line-following performance may be 
degraded with such lines and that care should be taken.  Other remedies could 
be to try a negative of better image contrast or to use a smaller reduction 
factor in the photography and to perform the digitising in halves (see section 
4). 

.P; A high threshold setting as required by the Focus calibration is assigned 
by positioning the close-up screen cursor with the keyboard cursor control keys
to 
the far right edge of the threshold graphs and hitting the space-bar.

.BL 2; Examples:  high threshold settings

.BL 15

.LE; The setting of the Focus is now possible and is achieved by depressing 
FB13 to issue 'FOC' to Laseraid.  This causes Lasertrak to re-scan the test 
line portion and generate a Focus graph on the close-up screen.  If the 
operator has not pressed FB4 (to issue a 'TXZ' - clear close-up screen command)
before starting this stage then the Focus graph will be superimposed on the 
threshold graph from stage d above.  The Focus graph always has a much lower 
peak than does the threshold graph and a correct Focus setting is achieved by
 steering the close-up screen cursors to the Focus peak and hitting the 
space-bar.  To 
distinguish between threshold and focus in the example below, the focus graph 
is shown as a dashed line. It is advisable to perform focus tests as described
above in two directions of test line. Horizontal and vertical test lines
should be used to reduce the chances of a badly astigmatic spot.

.TEST PAGE 15

.BL 2; Example: Focus

.BL 12

.LE; The threshold parameter should now be set correctly and this is achieved 
by repeating stage (d) above, though positioning the close-up screen cursor to 
about the centre of the threshold plateau peak.  It is also advisable to clear 
the close-up screen first by depressing FB4.

.BL 2; Example
.BR; Correct threshold

.BL12

.P; NOTE:  threshold determines how much detail the Lasertrak will see. 
Setting the close-up screen cursor more to the left of the plateau makes it 
see more (good for faint lines).  Settings nearer to the right makes it see 
less and hence is useful in very cluttered areas.  This threshold can 
always be modified slightly as digitising is taking place to ensure good
machine set-up and best digitising quality.

.LE; It is at this stage where operators can experiment with different 
portions of representative test lines to obtain a good average threshold 
reading.  It is possible to repeat stages (a), (b) and (f) on different line 
portions.  It is generally not necessary to repeat the focus procedures as 
defined in stages (d) and (e).

.LE; Setting the PHAse corrections in both axes (horizontal and vertical) 
follows next.  Operators should repeat the procedure detailed below on two 
test lines - one that is vertical and one that is horizontal (or as near as 
possible).  The test lines should be clear, straight and continuous (i.e. not 
broken).  First choose the test line and define its start and end with FB1 
(see stage (a) and (b) above).  Second, clear the close-up screen with FB4.  
Third, press the PHAse function button, FB5.  Since Lasertrak can scan lines 
both horizontally and vertically, it is important that these scans are 
produced in phase; this phase is different for different frequencies and 
different widths.  Phase measurement is performed by Lasertrak automatically 
in most cases and is confirmed on the close-up screen as a near-straight line 
graph crossing a horizontal line.  There will be a series of these near 
straight-line graphs for each of the line types that Lasertrak knows to 
expect from details held in its parameter file.  The correct phase setting is 
achieved where the line-graphs cross the horizontal line.  In most cases, 
Laseraid can determine this for itself.


.TEST PAGE 15

.BL 2
Example
.BR; Phase Correction

.BL 12


.P; This procedure is repeated for both vertical and horizontal test lines 


.LE; The final parameters which can be set easily in this cycle of events are 
the Red/Blue offsets and counts ratios; this procedure involves the use of 
commands WHL (FB3) and OCR (FB2).  These measurements do not involve the 
scanning of white lines on the source negative but of artificial white lines 
of known characteristics which are drawn by the Lasertrak on a light area of 
the photochromic film. It was for this reason that a black opaque area was
suggested to be included on the film master at the photography stage (see
section 4.5.2).
First, it is important to select a different line type 
for white line drawing and this is achieved by typing at the close-up screen 
keyboard the command
.BL 2
.CENTRE; ^*TYP#1\*######<carriage return>
.P; Next, show the Lasertrak where you wish the artificial white line to be 
drawn.  Use the STArt command (FB1) and mark a line vector of half an inch 
length (as explained in stage (a) above) on a clear area of the photochromic 
display.  The test line being constructed must be either horizontal or 
vertical - you will repeat the exercise for both in any case.

.P; Next depress FB3 (the WHL (white line) command) and notice that a white 
line with dark background is constructed on the photochromic display.  
Repeated use of the WHL command is suggested to ensure a very clear white line 
with dark background. If for any reason the white line is not seen to be drawn,
it means that Lasertrak's blue laser is not operative;  seek further help in
such situations.

.P; The actual measurements of offsets and counts ratios can now be performed 
by depressing FB2 to invoke the OCR command.  The Lasertrak is seen to 
scan repeatedly the white line and display on the close-up screen a graphic 
representation of the offsets and counts ratios that it sees.  The graphs 
produced - commonly known as the 'goal-posts' are shown below:

.BL 2
Example:
.BR; Offset and Counts Ratios

.BL12

.P; A good measurement is confirmed by a near-straight diagonal line.  
Repeated measurement by depressing OCR (FB2) again can improve the result.  
Usual reasons for failure - i.e. diagonals which are not straight - are caused 
by poor quality white-lines (repeat WHL) or poor threshold settings (repeat 
threshold measurement). It is recommended that OCR is performed at least twice.

.P; Repeat WHL and OCR for both horizontal and vertical white lines.

.LE; This concludes the routine set-up procedures which are carried out in 
check mode, though there are many other procedures involved in Lasertrak tuning 
which are detailed in the User's Guide.  Basic operators should not concern 
themselves with these.

discussed provide either confidence checks or aids to the machine tuning 
operations.  They are summarised below:

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",RL,")"
.LE; QUL (FB14) and QUW (FB15) give quantitative measurements of the quality 
of digitising.  QUL measures the quality of the observed line position with
respect to time and QUW measures width variations with respect to positions
across the scan. They are used on any orientation of straight lines.

.LE; CLO (FB12) provides close-up images on the close-up screen of the source 
data seen by a single scan of the Lasertrak in any selected location which
is defined by the laser cursor. This is by far the most useful tool which the
operator has to confirm successful tuning. It should always be used after
set-up to check for good scans and clean line connections at junctions.

.HL 2 ^&Calibration of the Lasertrak for Batches of Photography\&

.HL 3 ^&Overview\&

.P; The coordinate system used internally by the Lasertrak (which in most 
cases is transparent to its users) is somewhat different to the coordinate 
systems used in mapping.  Moreover, there are distortions in the 
Lasertrak's measurement system - due in part to non-linearities in the 
machine's optics and in part to photographic distortions introduced into the 
source fiche negatives by the various enlargement and reduction processes 
which have been carried out beforehand.  For all of these reasons it is 
ESSENTIAL that the Lasertrak is calibrated each time a new ^&batch\& of source 
photography is to be digitised or after major hardware repair.

.P; In essence, system calibration involves the generation of a set of cubic 
coefficients which are held in the relevant Laseraid parameter files to 
compensate for all of the distortions cited above.  It follows, therefore, 
that there will be different parameter files for each batch of photography 
^&AND\& also for each different Lasertrak machine.  Further, re-calibrations 
of all parameter files which are pertinent to a particular machine should be 
carried out after any maintenance work has been performed on the machine's 
optics system.

.P; The actual calibration procedure (i.e. the generation of the set of cubic 
coefficients) is achieved by instructing Laseraid to measure the positions of the
intersecting lines of a ^&standard grid\&.  Source negatives of this grid will 
have been made at the same time that the relevant batch of map photography was 
being carried out (see section 4.6).  A more reliable set of coefficients will 
be generated if many grid intersections are measured.  The minimum number 
allowed is sixteen, though Laser-Scan suggests at least twenty five for production 
work.  Indeed, the calibration sections of the software will not allow 
too few (or inappropriate) 
points to be measured, reporting "BAD POINT DISTRIBUTION" if attempts are
made.  The following sub-section describes in detail the procedures that 
should be performed for machine calibration.

.HL 3 ^&Lasertrak Calibration Procedure\&

.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"
.LE; A good contrast source negative of the standard grid relevant to the 
current batch of photography is inserted into the Lasertrak system (see

.P; Also appearing in the top right-hand corner of the photochromic display 
screen is a red cursor cross with the adjacent message "upper-right".  At this 
stage, Laseraid is requesting the extremes and pitch of the grid to be 
measured.  Note that at least sixteen intersections should be measured and 
their locations should cover the extremes of digitising area on the 
photochromic display screen in order to give a reliable set of 
cubic-coefficients.  There are two commands (both available on the function 
buttons) 
at this stage in the calibration procedure.  The usual command ABAndon is 
available on FB16 and this abandons calibrate mode and returns command to 
main mode.  The second command is OK or 'accept' which is available on FB4.

.P; The UPPER-RIGHT extreme of the calibration grid is defined by 
directing the 
laser cursor cross with the trackerball to the required grid intersection.  
This position is confirmed by then depressing FB4 to enter it and proceed to 
the next stage.

.LE; Calibrate mode then seeks to determine the lower-left extreme of the
calibration grid.  The red laser cursor-cross is seen to move to the
lower-left area of the photochromic display and the prompt "lower-left" 
appears 
adjacent to it.  The location of this lower-left extreme is then selected with 
the trackerball and confirmed with FB4 "OK".

.LE; It is then necessary to show the calibrate mode the x and y grid pitch 
or 'steps' to be used.  The laser cursor should be directed via the 
trackerball to the required x increment (x direction is considered to be along 
a horizontal line, y is along a vertical line).  Confirmation is given with 
FB4 "OK".

.LE; The y-pitch or step is supplied in a similar way to x in step (e) above.

.LE; Once the details of the calibration grid have been supplied as per steps 
(c) - (f) above, it is then possible to perform the intersection measures.  In 
fact, the Lasertrak will have already attempted to measure the first 
lower-left intersection and confirmation of success will have been given with a 
bleep from the close-up terminal and entry into the second phase of the 
calibration procedure.  This second phase involves the measurement of each 
grid intersection and a report of each success or failure.  Confirmation of 
entry into phase two of calibrate mode is given by a new pattern of lights 
on the function buttons as shown below:  each of the commands available have 
importance.

.END LITERAL
.INDEX SKI> calibrate mode> function button> skip poor measure
.INDEX CON> calibrate mode> function button> automatic calibration
.INDEX NO> calibrate mode> function button> quit calibration 


.P; Note above that FB13 has importance here, since although it has no
illumination, it is accommodating a command "CON". It has no illumination 
as yet, because it is a flip-flop command; it is an option that can be either 
requested or ignored - the default in this case is for it to be ignored.  
See step (l) below for details of its use.

.LE; The procedure now is to measure each of the assigned grid intersections 
in turn - the Lasertrak knows where each of these are by virtue of the grid 
details supplied to it in steps (c) - (f) above.  The measurement procedure is 
performed automatically; it is the job of the operator to confirm success 
of a measure with the "OK" command (FB4).  This acceptance enables the 
Lasertrak to proceed to the next intersection for measurement.  As each 
measurement is carried out, its acceptance is confirmed by a small cross shown 
on the close-up screen which overlays exactly the measured point.  Each grid 
intersection is measured in this way until the complete grid (as defined 
initially by the operator) has been examined.  There are a number of other 
provisions and facilities in the calibration measurement procedure of which 
operators should be aware - these are described in steps (i) - (l) below.

.LE; ^&The AUT command (FB2) - automatic - or re-scan request\&.  The 
descriptions of calibration given thus far have assumed that the Lasertrak is 
able to detect and measure each grid intersection with total success.  However,
there are occasions when some intersections cannot be detected correctly - 
possibly because of a low contrast or a poor source negative
or conflict with linework.  On such
occasions, the Lasertrak will report its failure by issuing on the close-up
screen the command 
.BL 2
.CENTRE;"Manual measure please"
.BL 2
At this point, there are a number of options 
open to the operator.  On pressing FB2 to issue a "AUT" command, the Lasertrak 
is instructed to attempt a re-scan on the suspect point.  This can be repeated 
several times, though continued failure may mean performing a manual measure 
(see j below) or skipping it altogether (see k below).

.LE; ^&The MAN command (FB8) - request the manual measurement of an 
intersection\&.  If repeated attempts to scan and measure a grid intersection 
have failed as outlined in step (i) above, it is necessary to request operator 
intervention to measure a point manually.  This request is made with FB8 at 
which time the command 'MAN' is issued.  Manual measure involves the Lasertrak 
scanning the grid intersection and displaying at very enlarged scale on the 
close-up screen the lines as seen by the scan.  The cross hair cursors are 
also displayed and these can be pointed to the intersection centre by means of 
the cursor control keys and sent to Laseraid by hitting the space-bar.  In this way 
the grid intersection is measured and Lasertrak will pass on to the next 
intersection as normal.

.LE; ^&The SKI command (FB12) - skip and ignore a poor measure\&.  In the 
event that neither an automatic measure by Lasertrak nor a manual measure by 
the operator has produced reliable results (perhaps because of a poor source 
image) it is possible to skip and ignore the offending intersection.  This is 
achieved by depressing FB12 to SKIp rather than depressing FB4 to accept or 
FB8 to request manual measure.  Operators are advised not to ignore too many 
intersections (especially locally) and certainly to be aware of the minimum 
acceptable number of measures for calculating the cubic-coefficients (see section 
9.5.1).

.LE; ^&The CON command option (FB13) - request CONtinuous, automatic 
measurement with minimum operator intervention\&.  Under normal circumstances, 
this option is very useful and can speed the calibration exercise 
considerably.  The default option is for CON not to run; operators may select 
it by depressing FB13 (which will be confirmed by the illumination of FB13).  
Continuous measurement enables the Lasertrak to proceed automatically from 
grid point-to-grid point with no pause, providing that each intersection is 
seen clearly without confusion or error.  This means that operators no longer 
have to confirm acceptance of a measurement between points.  In the event that 
a bad measure is encountered, the Lasertrak will halt the continuous option 
and request "Manual Measure please".  At this point the operator can either 
attempt a re-scan (AUT), manual measure (MAN) or ignore (SKI) as desired.  
Re-activation of the CONtinuous option is then achieved by further depressing 
FB13.

.LE; ^&The NO command (FB16) - abort calibrate mode\&.  Depressing FB16 
returns operation to Laseraid main-mode.

.LE; ^&Acceptance or correction of the calibration\&.  As soon as the last 
point of the calibration grid has been measured and accepted, the system 
automatically reports the quality of calibration exercise.  The following 
details are displayed on the close-up screen:  confirmation of the number of 
points which have been measured and accepted and a statement of the residuals 
obtained between measured and corrected point locations.  The summary of the 
residuals are given in a form as shown in the example below.

.P; The above diagram reports the quality of the measurements performed (in 
units known to Laser-Scan as HRD counts).  Users need not be too familiar with 
those units, though it should be realised that residuals of greater than 15 
HRD counts are too large and should be re-measured.  In fact, 1 HRD-count
represents approximately 1 micron on the negative. The matrix of numbers on 
the close-up screen represents (by measured intersection location) the 
residuals in the x direction (upper) and y direction (lower).  Thus in the 
example cited above the reading of x=23, y=13 in row 2, column 2 ought to be 
re-measured.  This is attempted by either auto re-scan (FB2) or manual measure 
(FB8). Note that row 3 column 2 is a grid intersection without any readings,
as that intersection was skipped.

.P; The acceptance or rejection of a set of readings is achieved by either 
depressing FB4 ("OK" command) or FB16 ("NO" command).  Acceptance enables 
Laseraid to generate the new cubic coefficients and return the user to main 
mode.  Rejection enables users to re-scan, manual measure or skip 
intersections as described before.

.HL 2 ^&Control-Point Measurement to Assign a Coordinate reference System\&

.HL 3 ^&Introduction\&

.P; In order to digitise with an appropriate scaling and coordinate system, it 
is necessary for operators to measure the positions of the control points
on the Lasertrak and supply details of their known Cartesian coordinates.  The 
positions of the control points need not be square in relation to each other, 
but they should be located as near to the edges of the map extremes as possible 
- certainly no more than 10 per cent of the sheets total length away from the 
edge.  The control points should also be clear with a high line-contrast; it 
may have been necessary to enhance the clarity of the map control points prior 
to the photography stage (see section 4.5.1).

.HL 3 ^&Measure Procedure - control points (CP)\&

.P; Once the map negative is mounted correctly on its film holder in the 
Lasertrak, it is possible to measure the control points and assign the 
coordinate system.  The individual steps below describe the sequence of CP 
measurement.

on the close-up screen's keyboard whilst in main mode.

.LE; The action of step (a) places Laseraid in control point measuring mode and 
the laser cursor will move automatically to the vicinity of the first control
point to be measured.  By convention, all Laser-Scan systems and software 
adopt the following sequence (or ordering) of control points:  NW,SW,SE,NE.  
Thus, the laser cursor in Measure mode will first attempt to scan and measure the 
NW control point. If it is successful it will display the default coordinates 
to be used on the close-up screen and seek confirmation of acceptance.  If it 
unsuccessful in finding the control point, the message 
.BL 2
.CENTRE; "Can't find fiducial" 
.BL 2
is displayed with an audible "bleep".

.LE; In failure situations when attempting to scan control point locations, 
operators should reposition the laser cursor on the appropriate control point 
and attempt either an AUTo re-scan (FB2) or a MANual measure (FB8).  The 
function button options available this time are described below

.LE; Once a successful control measurement has been achieved (confirmed by 
accurate superimposition of the red laser cross on the source negative cross) 
it is then necessary to accept it.

.P; This is achieved with (FB4) "OK".  As an alternative, rejection would be 
to perform a re-scan with AUT (FB2) or a manual measure (FB8).  Pressing "NO" 
(FB16) does not reject a single point; it quit Measure mode completely and returns 
command to main mode.  Note all four control points must have been measured and 
accepted before it is possible to digitise line work.

.LE; At this same time, it is possible (and may be necessary) to issue new 
control  point coordinates.  These are assigned by typing-in on the close-up 
screen keyboard the new values for x and y (separated by a space) immediately 
prior to control  point acceptance with (FB4) "OK".  The default values which 
are assumed by the system if no others are supplied, are those which were used 
during the last run of the current Lasertrak parameter (or patch) file.

.LE; There are some important considerations of control  point assignments 
and these are discussed in section 9.6.4).

.LE; The remaining control  points (SW,SE,NE) are measured in exactly the same 
way.  On each occasion, the laser cursor will look in the vicinity of the 
relevant control point in an attempt to find and measure each one.

.LE; Once all four control points have been measured and accepted, the close-up 
screen displays their details (including new coordinate values, if supplied) 
and operators have a final chance to accept "OK" (FB4) or reject "NO" (FB16) 
them.  Acceptance passes on to the final fiducial error stage (see step i) and 
rejection quits Measure mode and returns directly to main mode.

.LE; ^&Fiducial Optics Check\&.  The final stage of the control point procedure 
is the assignment of an appropriate threshold value for an optics check which 
gives confidence of accurate digitising.  This is an automatic fiducial check 
performed at intervals automatically by the system to test for such unlikely 
events as optics drift.  The check is performed by re-measuring the position of 
a nominated control point after a specified number of features have been 
digitised.  If the measured displacement is greater than the nominated 
tolerance, it will report the fact to the operator who will have to re-measure 
the control  points again as described in this section (9.6.2).  The initial set
-up of this fiducial check is made at this stage in the procedure.  Laseraid 
requests responses to be given via the close-up terminal to the following 
three questions:

.BL 2

"WHICH CORNER AS FIDUCIAL (1-4)?"
.BL
.LM +10

- operators should choose a clear, distinct control  for the fiducial check; the 
number supplied represents the standard Laser-Scan ordering
.BL
.LM +4
-1###=###Select an additional control point 
.LM +1
.BR;1###=###NW
.BR;2###=###SW
.BR;3###=###SE
.BR;4###=###NE
.BR;0###=###do not run fiducial check at all.
.LM -5

.BL

^&Note :\& If -1 is selected on subsequent remeasuring of the control points,
then the values entered for the fiducial checks from the previous 
measurements will be reassigned. In order to redefine the additional control 
point for the fiducial check it is necessary to issue the following command
whilst in main mode:
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*CHF 0 0\*
.BL

- The operator will then be able to select a different control point
for the fiducial check.
.LM -10
.BL2
"EVERY HOW MANY FEATURES?"
.BL
.LM +10

- Laseraid expects a nominated number of features to dictate the frequency of 
the fiducial check - Laser-scan suggests every 5 features.  Thus the fiducial 
check would be performed automatically each time five features have been 
digitised.

.LM -10

.BL2

"MAX PERMITTED ERROR?"
.BL
.LM +10
- this is the allowable distance error of measured position in microns (1/
1000th of mm) - Laser-Scan suggests every 15 microns
.LM -10
.END LIST

.P; Appropriate responses to each of these questions will give the 
confirmation message, for example

.BL 2

"FID 3 EVERY 5 FEATURES WITH ERROR LIMIT OF 15 MICRONS"  
.BL 2
on the close-up 
screen and control then passes automatically to main-mode. 
In the event that the fiducial error limit is reported to have been exceeded
whilst digitising, it is necessary for the operator 
to quit digitising temporarily and re-enter Measure mode for control point 
remeasurement. If continuous drift is reported by the system during a
digitising session, it is advisable to seek advise from the Laser-Scan
Service Department.

.END LIST

.HL 3 ^&Some Important Considerations On Values Assigned to Control Points\&

.LIST

.LE; The Lasertrak assumes that all source documents are to be digitised in a 
rectangular Cartesian coordinate grid system.  All distances, therefore, are 
linear and a square map space is assumed. All control  point entries are placed
in Layer 0.

.LE; All data files generated by Laseraid digitising software are unprocessed 
initially.  This means that although details of control
coordinates have been supplied at machine set-up time, all generated 
digitising is held in a special Lasertrak "calibration space"
until such time as the file is run through a post-processing 
stage (after digitising is completed) - see section 11.  Therefore, it is
possible to alter the values of the control points before the file is
processed into the specified map coordinates. The post-processing program is 
called LAPROCESS. (see section 11)

.LE; Operators should be aware of the limits of coordinate precision in 
Laser-Scan's IFF data files.  Sufficient storage is reserved in IFF to 
enable a single ordinate to be held with full precision by up to six figures.  
This means that coordinates of a greater length will lose accuracy.  For these 
reasons, it is recommended that operators digitise into a coordinate system 
which falls within these precision limits.  A good solution is to digitise 
locally into a millimetre or inches system relative to a maps South West 
corner.  Full eight or nine figure grid references are not acceptable and in 
such cases operators are advised to relate grid values to some local offset datum 
which reduces the values of the coordinates over the map being digitised.

.END LIST
.P; In general, Laseraid will report problems with control  point 
distributions, although care should be taken in the assignment of control
point values. The message

.BL
.CENTRE; "Bad corner points or cubic coefficients"
.BL
for example, suggests that the combination of measured control  locations and 
supplied coordinates do not give a valid, square digitising space and 
operators are advised to re-check the control  locations, their measured 
position, the supplied coordinates and in extreme cases also the previously
run CALibration procedure.

.PAGE

.HL 2 ^&Operator Identification\&

.P; There are facilities within the IFF structure to hold single line 
descriptions of text which can be used by operators to identify files of data 
uniquely.  These single lines of text are held within the NS entry of IFF 
files (see the IFF user's guide
for details).  The maximum number 
of characters comprising the line of text is restricted to seventy-two.  
 
.P; By default, the NS entry is stored with details of the date, time,
username and Lasertrak machine number. It is recommended that these default
entries are used for everyday operation. However the operator may override 
the default entry by issuing the following command 
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*OP\*###or###^*IDE\*
.BL; Either command is entered via the close-up screen keyboard whilst in 
Laseraid main mode followed by the rest of the line giving the required text 
details.
.PAGE

.HL 1 ^&LINE DIGITISING WITH LASERAID\&

.HL 2 ^&Introduction\&

.BL; At this point, the initialisation for the Lasertrak digitising 
process will have been completed. Therefore, stage one (as described in
section 9.1) will have been completed.
.BL;
To reiterate:

.LIST

.LE; Stage one is the initialisation or set-up stage as described
and performed in
section 9. Stages two and three concern the actual 
line-following (or edge-following) digitising procedures.

.LE; Stage two is considered to be the feature selection 
stage in which the operator chooses those lines which require to be digitised. 
This could mean working sequentially across a map sheet - selecting every 
line on the source document until each has been completed - or it could 
involve just choosing a smaller, sub-set of lines defined by the job's 
specification.  

.LE; Stage three is considered to be the actual automatic line 
following process, including any assistance and intervention as deemed to be 
necessary by the operator or when requested by the software.  Map digitising 
is achieved by alternating between stages two and three repeatedly until the 
job is completed.
.END LIST

.P; Operators need to be aware of two modes of operation which Laseraid adopts 
during line digitising: 
.LIST

.LE; ^&MAIN MODE\& is the base software level always adopted by 
Laseraid initially 
.LE; ^&HELP MODE\& is used when operator assistance is being given.  
There are a number of other sub-modes which have a lesser 
usage, and these are described as necessary in the following 
descriptions.
.END LIST

.BL; Laseraid is capable of following three main varieties of linear
feature:
.LIST
.LE; LINES. This is the principal type of line following and 
is the chief concern of this introductory document.Lines may
include many styles such as pecks, curves, thickness variations and so on.
.BL; Laseraid is designed specifically to follow transparent linework on a 
black negative background. However, it is possible to work 
with inverse polarity in order to track along the darkened centre of
parallel white lines.  The
adjustment of the necessary parameters to achieve inverse polarity is 
described in detail in the Laseraid 
Reference Manual.
.LE; AREAS.  In this mode, Laseraid is capable of following the edges of 
solid fills. This is done by detecting the difference between white and black on
the negative, rather than detecting the white line on the black background 
which is performed for normal line following.
.LE; JUNCTIONS.  The philosophy of digitising with junctions is to follow 
lines and, if desired, to recognise, display and accept automatically the 
location of each junction before continuing scanning along the line. Once a 
junction has been recognised and registered, its coordinate position is held 
within a rapid access list by the VAX computer; this is known as the
'junction list'.  In this way, it is easy for operators to return to any 
junction, that has had one or more arms digitised, merely by depressing a 
function button.  Further lines to be digitised which are entrant to that 
junction can then be followed.  
The result is unique junction creation and quicker throughput for 
polygon and urban map digitising. Junctions remain in this special junction 
list throughout the time that there are still entrant lines to be digitised.  
Once all lines entering a junction have been digitised, its entry is removed 
from the junction list. 

.P; JUNCTION SCANS.  i.e. the procedures which the Lasertrak performs when it
thinks it has found a junction - are generated automatically.  By default, the
system will know whether or not to expect junctions along a line by virtue of
the line-type and scan parameters held in the system parameter file.  However,
junction recognition expectancy can be overruled and turned on or off
interactively by means of a function button.  Furthermore, in the event that
the Lasertrak is unable to recognise a junction automatically, there are
facilities by which junction locations can be defined interactively (i.e.
manually) either by means of the laser cursor position or the close-up screen
facility.  Typical evidence that a junction has not been spotted successfully
could include the inability to display junction arms before continuing 
automatically or when the laser does stop at a junction with 
tram-lines being displayed for guidance. Unless the paint-out facility has 
been suppressed, it will paint-out all lines entrant to a junction at the 
time when the digitised feature is accepted.  There are extensions to 
paint-out so that short segments of line always remain at junctions. This 
provides a tool to 
confirm to operators the position of junctions. 

.P; It is also possible to set up the parameter file to recognise junctions 
and wait for the operator to accept the junction before continuation of 
line following. Details of this use of 'JNC' for the adjustment of the scan 
parameters to alter the nature of junction recognition, can be found in the 
Laseraid Reference Manual.
.END LIST

.HL 2 ^&Selection of Feature Layers and the Base Feature Serial Number\&

.P; Before the Lasertrak can begin to digitise any lines at the start of a 
digitising session, it is first necessary to select a layer within 
the IFF structure is to be used to place the data.  Details of the 
hierarchical (or layer) structure of IFF are given in the  
IFF Reference Manual.  Confirmation that the layer has yet to be selected 
(when Laseraid has just been started) is shown by the question mark (?) which 
appears on the photochromic screen adjacent to the laser cursor-cross.  
Layer assignment is achieved via the close-up screen keyboard 
with the command LAY which is followed by a numeric argument to define the 
layer number to be used.  The current maximum number of layers possible is 
64, though the naming convention can be any number between 1 and 32767.

.P; Typical layer assignment might be achieved by the example below
.BL
.INDEX LAY> main mode> keyboard> create or set layer
.CENTRE; ^*LAY 5\*######<carriage return>
.BL
This will report the confirmation message
.BL
.CENTRE; "Layer 5 created and selected"
.BL
The above message confirms that layer 5 did not exist before and that it has 
therefore been created and selected.  If it already exists (perhaps from a 
previous digitising session) the message would be restricted to:
.BL
.CENTRE; "Layer 5 selected"

.P; Further confirmation of successful layer selection is given on the 
photochromic screen display: the previous question mark (?) appearing adjacent 
to the laser cursor cross will have changed to a number.  This number 
corresponds to the current feature serial number of the next feature to be 
digitised (unless the options 'HTD' or 'HTI' were specified on the Laseraid 
command line to show contour elevations instead of serial numbers):  this is 
using Laseraid in height mode - see section 10.2.2

.HL 3 ^&Laseraid in Normal Feature Mode\&

.P; In the simplest case, the number being shown adjacent to the laser cursor 
will be 1, showing that the file being created is new with no other features 
included at present.  Operators are able to change the value of this serial 
number at will, by entering the new value required via the close-up keyboard.  
No Laseraid command needs to prefix this number (though the command 'NF' is 
optional, if desired).  As an example, on typing in the value '226' on the 
close-up keyboard (followed by carriage return) it will be seen that value 
'226' appears adjacent to the laser cursor on the photochromic screen.  The 
next feature to be digitised will have serial number 226 and this will be held 
in the IFF entry 'NF' - new feature - see IFF User's Guide.

.P; By default, Laseraid will increment the base serial number by one 
automatically on each occasion that a feature has been digitised and accepted. 
 There are two commands possible to change this incrementing operation.  Both 
are entered from the close-up keyboard and both need to be given with a 
numeric argument.

.P; The two commands are:
.BL
^*ANF#n\*###(set automatic increment of feature number to n)
.BL
^*MNF#n\*####(set manual increment of feature number to n)
.BL
Use of the commands is easy and logical:  the command
.BL
.CENTRE; ANF#10
.BL
makes each serial number be increment automatically by ten each time the 
previous feature is digitised and accepted.  The use of MNF is slightly 
different - it is used in conjunction with two other commands which are 
provided on two function buttons in Laseraid main-mode.  These two commands 
are 'INC' (increment - FB15) and 'DEC' (decrement - FB14).  This combination 
of commands enables operators to have total flexibility in assigning feature 
serial numbers manually.  Its operation is described below.  MNF performs in a 
similar way to ANF except that the increment/decrement value (which is defined
by the argument to the command) is applied manually when operators depress 
FB14 (DEC) and FB15 (INC).  It is ^&essential\& that operators de-activate the 
ANF facility if they wish to use the MNF option; this is achieved with the 
command
.BL
.CENTRE; ANF#0

.HL 3 ^&Laseraid in Special Height Mode\&

.P; In the case when Laseraid is to be used in height mode (i.e. the 
parameters 'HTD' or 'HTI' are included in the Laseraid invoking command line 
- see section 8.2), it is necessary to include different commands to establish 
elevation (or height) increments and decrements.

.P; The commands AHT and MHT are analogous to ANF and MNF respectively (see 
10.2.1).  By setting MHT, it means that DECrement and INCrement on FB14 and 
FB15 operate on the coding of elevation data.  ANF still has relevance and 
provides mechanisms to increment feature serial numbers automatically.  MNF 
has no real effect when using Laseraid in height mode when, no doubt, MHT will 
have been set.

.PAGE
.HL 2 ^&MAIN MODE\&

.P; This is the software level from which most other modes are selected and 
entered.  It is also the mode from which Laseraid can be terminated with the 
command EOS (end-of-session).  The selection of features for digitising is 
carried out in main mode.

.P; Successful entry into Laseraid main mode is confirmed with the following 
pattern of function button lights.

There are many commands available in Laseraid main mode with which basic 
operators need not be concerned.  Reference to the complete list of commands 
should be made in the Lasertrak Reference Manual.  To serve as an introduction, 
only a small sub-set of the most important commands (with which users should 
be aware) are described in this manual.  As usual, there are commands 
available both via the function buttons and from the close-up keyboard; 
commands most widely used are held on the function buttons.
.BL 4
.HL 3 ^&Function button commands in main mode:\&

.P; The first eight function buttons are used to initiate actions such as 
feature select or re-paint.  The next five buttons are used as flip-flops to 
set options such as reverse next feature, and the last three buttons provide 
control functions.

.P; The function buttons generally have the following meanings, although each 
of the six feature start buttons (FB1,2,3,5,6,7) can be programmed to refer to 
any line type along with its associated line following mode and its feature (or 
attribute) code

selection stage of digitising (stage 2 in Laser-Scan's philosophy to 
digitising mentioned in sections 9.1, 10.1 above).  This selection operation 
involves directing the laser cursor 
with the trackerball to a position near to the start of the line to be 
digitised.  Once the operator is happy with the cursor's position, he can 
register it with any of the commands STR (FB1), CUR (FB2), RAN (FB3) or ORT 
(FB5).  By this action, he has done a number of things.  Firstly he has 
instructed Laseraid that it can prepare for line-following (at which time it 
will move into HELP MODE immediately to seek assistance - see section 10.4).  
Secondly, he has supplied an attribute code for the line which is next in line 
to be digitised.  Thirdly, he has warned Laseraid what sort of line 
characteristic to expect so that it can gain an idea of the best
line-following methods to use from look-up tables in its current parameter file.
This may include line following, line following with junction recognition and
area or edge following. 

.P; In practice, these commands need not be restricted to straights, curves, 
randomly curves and orthogonals.  They really refer to the lists of
line-following parameters which best suit the line to be digitised. For example,
Laseraid can be tuned so that it will follow the black centre line of a 
double cased road - thereby running in inverse mode. These parameters are 
held in the parameter file and operators are advised to seek 
advice locally to best understand which function buttons to use for each
line-type on their own Lasertrak installation.

.LE; ^&REP (FB4) - re-paint out\&

.P; The Lasertrak is able to paint-out each line from the photochromic display 
screen, once the line has been digitised and accepted.  For a number of 
reasons, the operator may wish to paint-out these lines again.  A typical 
reason might be paint-out fade which re-occurs about every thirty minutes as 
the photochromic film image begins to disappear.  Other reasons could be 
re-paint-out after the selection of a clean frame of photochromic film or 
before 
continuation of a digitising session which was first started on a previous 
occasion.  The command 'REP' on FB4 in main mode forces Laseraid to paint-out 
once again all lines digitised in the IFF file to-date.

.P; Use of REP for repaint has its limitations because it can be a fairly
lengthy process when a large digitised file is being processed.  Operators can
always abandon a re-paint easily with 'ABA' on FB16.  'REP' performs the
re-paint in reverse order, thus the latest lines digitised are painted out
first.  This reverse paint out further slows its operation.  The advantage of
'REP' is that it can be invoked by a function button.  An alternative option
is forward paint-out (the FOR keyboard command), which is performed more
quickly - particularly when operators use it in conjunction with the WIN
keyboard command to define a window within which re-paint out is to be
performed (see item (m) below).

.LE; ^&POI (FB6) digitise a Point Feature\&

.P; The digitising of point features is different in concept to line-following. 
Such features are fixed with the command 'POI' on FB6.  Operators direct the 
laser cursor-cross to the vicinity of the point to be digitised and register 
its type with FB6 to issue a POInt digitise command.  There are two types of
point feature capture:
.LIST
.LE; Restricted to cross symbols:'X' and '+' and 'O's
.LE; Square features - one or more square features such as buildings are 
captured in a single scan and output to the IFF file as one or a number
of oriented symbols.
.END LIST
Use of FB6 moves Laseraid into a special sub-mode for point features which is 
confirmed with a new pattern of function button lights as shown below

line-following, providing that they are sufficiently small, closed, isolated
features.  A general guide to feature size possible is all objects of approx
maximum size of 1 cm (0.4 inches) square on the photochromic display screen. 

.P; Small feature digitising is performed in the following manner.  First the 
operator directs the laser cursor with trackerball to a close vicinity of the 
small feature to be digitised.  Its type is registered by depressing FB7 to 
issue a 'SMF' command.  At this point, Laseraid moves into small feature mode 
and the following pattern of lights will illuminate on the function buttons:

Laseraid attempts to scan the small, closed feature automatically.  If the
scan and digitising is successful the close-up screen "bleeps" and the object 
is seen to glow in red refresh on the photochromic screen.  
The operator is then free to use the above commands to accept or
reject the digitising.

.P; In the event that the small feature scan is unsuccessful, no audible
"bleep" is heard and the extreme dimensions of the small-feature scan are
shown as a red-refresh box on the photochromic screen.  Operators can attempt
a re-scan repeatedly by further depressing FB7 to issue another SMF command. 
At the same time, the trackerball can be used to re-position the scan box more
appropriately over the small feature on the photochromic display screen.  As
an aid, it is suggested that small features be positioned as close to the
lower-left extremes of the scan box as possible to ensure a successful
measure. If repeated scans are unsuccessful, then the feature can be 
digitised with normal line following using FB4

.P; If the line type of the small feature to be captured has been set-up
in the parameter file to use edge following then the

.LE; ^&GNF (FB8) Get Next Feature\&

.P; The operation of this facility is dependent on the line type to be used for 
digitising. If simple line following is to be performed then GNF will refer
to a preset guidance file. Preguidance is considered to be advanced 
usage of Laseraid
and is not discussed in this introductory document.

.P; The principal use of the 'GNF' facility is when junction recognition is 
enabled. It
only becomes relevant to digitising after one or a series of
junctions have already been recognised and their positions are fixed.  Repeated
use of the 'GNF' command (Get Next Feature) on FB8 in main mode aids and
speeds the feature selection stage for digitising.  Each time a junction is
recognised, its location and other details such as the number of entrant links
and their direction are entered into a special junction
list in the computer memory. This entry remains throughout the time that there 
are still links to
be digitised which are entrant to that junction.  The action of repeated use
of 'GNF' (FB8) is to count continually and cyclically through the current
junction list and position the laser cursor exactly over each junction in
turn.  In most cases, subsequent single scans by selecting the desired
line-type are able to present to the operator a reasonable guess of the likely
line from which to leave the junction position with line-following. 

.P; Readers are also referred to the keyboard main mode command 'ZIJ' which 
clears the junction list, thereby resetting it to have zero items.

.LE; ^&POS (FB9) Flip-Flop (default off) Paint Out Suppress\&

.P; Lasertrak is able to paint-out from the photochromic display all features 
that have been digitised, once they have been accepted by the operator when
in help mode.  The default option is for this paint-out facility to be switched 
on.  Selection of the Paint-Out Suppress 'POS' facility on FB9 at any time 
whilst in main mode enables the paint-out facility to be suppressed.  The 
result is that all subsequent lines to be digitised are no longer painted-out 
for the entire time that the POS option is active.  Confirmation that 'POS' is 
operative is given by the illumination of FB9; it is normally extinguished.  
Once 'POS' is deactivated (turned-off), perhaps at a later stage, all lines which 
formerly had their paint-out suppressed are then all painted out as soon as 
the next feature to be digitised is accepted.

.P; A typical reason for using paint-out suppress is to speed digitising 
rates or to make complex areas easier to see and interpret.

.LE; ^&FINd (FB10) Flip-Flop (default off) automatic Feature find and start\&

.P; The FINd option is a very useful facility to speed digitising - 
particularly on sparse-to-medium density data or easy linework such as 
contours.  The 
default option is for 'FIN' to be turned-off and it is activated whilst in 
Laseraid main mode by depressing FB10.  Confirmation that 'FIN' has been 
selected is given by the illumination of FB10; it is normally extinguished.

.P; Under normal circumstances (when 'FIN' is not selected) digitising would
involve the registering of the type of line to be digitised (see paragraphs a,c,d 
above), followed automatically with immediate entry into help mode (see
section 10.4) for 
operators to give Laseraid further assistance such as the direction to 
start scanning. 

.P; Use of the 'FIN' option provides facilities to remove much of this 
basic operator assistance - particularly if the direction to follow the lines 
is not too important.  Once 'FIN' has been selected with FB10 the operator 
need merely direct the laser to the vicinity of the line to be followed and 
register its type.  Once this is done, Lasertrak tries automatically to find 
the line and begin to line-follow automatically in a direction that it 
chooses; there is a tendency by default for it to digitise upwards 
on the photochromic 
screen by default.  Once line-following has commenced, it will continue until 
such time as the end of line is reached or operator intervention or help is 
required.  In both cases, Laseraid will enter HELP mode for an operator 
decision to be made (see section 10.4).

.P; There is a particularly useful facility when 'FIN' is selected which eases 
considerably some line digitising such as contours.  This facility involves 
the automatic connection of lines that have been digitised in two 
halves in opposite 
directions.  To use this facility, operators should not commence digitising 
the line feature by first directing the laser cursor to the features start.  
Instead, they should choose some point in the centre of the feature's course.  
In this way, once the line type has been registered Laseraid will begin to 
line-follow one half of the line feature in a direction that it chooses.  Once 
this half is completed, accepted and painted-out, the cursor will 
automatically find the other half of the line and digitise it too in the 
opposite direction again after its line type has been established again with either 
STR (FB1), CUR (FB2), RAN (FB3).  Once both halves of the feature have been 
digitised in opposite directions, the system automatically reverses the 
digitising of one of the halves and connects it to the other half to produce a 
simple, connected digitised line as though it had been digitised in one 
direction from start to finish in the first place. The overriding benefit
of using this technique for digitising is that the line-following is
assured of scanning right to the end of lines; which is not necessarily
the case when relying on the operator to position the cursor manually
at line ends.

.P; De-selection of 'FIN' is achieved by depressing again FB10 whilst in main 
mode and confirmation is given by the extinguishing of the function button 
light.

.LE; ^&SQR (FB11) - Flag next feature for squaring\&

.P; The action of depressing FB11 is to issue the 'SQR'
command which will 'flag' or mark every feature that is digitised subsequently 
in the IFF file for squaring by post-hoc processing software (see LAPROCESS
User's Guide).
Features are not squared immediately by Laseraid, they are merely flagged to
be squared later.  The selection of 'SQR' on FB11 is confirmed by the
illumination of FB11.  It is de-selected by depressing FB11 again whilst in
main mode, at which time the button's illumination is seen to extinguish.  
All features which are digitised throughout the time that 'SQR' is operative
will be flagged for squaring. 

.LE; ^&REV (FB12) Flip-Flop (default off) force the next feature as digitised 
to be reversed\&

.P; The 'REV' option is selected via FB12 whilst in main mode and is confirmed 
by the illumination of FB12.  Its action is to force the next feature only 
which is to  
be digitised to be  reversed if necessary to
ensure that its coordinates run clockwise. It is only operable on closed
loop features and then only if they are digitised anticlockwise. Its action
is to ensure that all closed loop features are digitised in the same
direction. 'REV' is only 
operable for the feature which is digitised immediately after the option has 
been selected.  As soon as this feature has been captured and accepted the 
option is de-selected automatically.  'REV' can be selected repeatedly by 
re-pressing FB12 before each feature is digitised if there are a number of 
lines which require to be reversed.  Once selected, the 'REV' option can be 
cancelled with 'ABA' (FB16) prior to the feature being digitised.

.LE; ^&OPEn (FB13) Flip-Flop (default off) turn off closure detection\&

.P; Under normal circumstances, the Lasertrak is continuously searching for 
closed features. As soon as it reaches a location along a line being digitised 
which equals the start position of that line, Lasertrak will halt and report 
in help mode that the end of a closed loop feature has been reached.  This 
facility can be turned-off with the 'OPE' command (FB13) in main mode.  
Confirmation is given by the illumination of FB13 and the option remains 
active until it is de-selected by again depressing FB13.

.P; Care is necessary in its use.  Attempts to digitise a loop feature with 
'OPE' selected as operative will mean that the Lasertrak will no longer know the location 
of the features end-point and it will, in fact, cycle repeatedly until such a 
time as the operator halts line-following manually.

.LE; ^&DEC/INC (FB14/FB15) Decrement and Increment manually\&

.P; The 'INC' and 'DEC' commands are used in conjunction with the keyboard 
commands 'MNF' and 'MHT' and their function depends on whether Laseraid is 
running in feature mode (see 10.2.1) or elevation - or height - mode (see 
10.2.2).

.P; On depressing either 'DEC' (FB14) or 'INC' (FB15) (repeatedly if desired) 
whilst in main mode the action is to decrement or increment the coding 
(feature serial number or feature elevation code) by the interval defined by 
the keyboard commands MNF or MHT.  In Laseraid's normal (or feature) mode, 
'MNF' is used and DEC/INC operate on the feature serial numbers (NF entries in 
IFF).  In Laseraid elevation mode (which is established by the keywords 'HTD' 
or 'HTI' on the invoking command line - see section 8.2), 'MHT' is used and 
DEC/INC operate on the feature elevation coding (AC entries in IFF).

.LE; ^&ABA (FB16) Abandon\&

.P; As usual, 'ABA' is the panic, error exit command available at all times on 
FB16.  Its effect is to cancel any previous operations:  repeated use also 
centres the laser cursor on the photochromic display screen.

.LIST
.LE; ^&WIN - define a WINDOW for local paint-out\&

.P; Paragraph (b) in  section (10.3) describes the nature of re-paint-out in 
Lasertrak.  By its nature, total paint-out of a large map image can be a 
lengthy process and hence in many instances it is appropriate to re-paint-out 
only those lines which fall with a localised rectangular space.  This is 
possible with the main mode keyboard command 'WIN'.

.P; The use of 'WIN' is achieved by typing it as a prefix to the 'FOR' 
(forward paint-out) or 'REP' (re-paint-out) command (see item b, above).  The 
commands are typed on the same line and separated by at least one space.  Up
to seven layers may be selected at any one time for paint out.
By issuing the following command:
.BL
.CENTRE; WIN   FOR n1 - n6     <carriage return>
.BL
Laseraid will enter 'window paint-out' mode which is confirmed by the 
function button pattern of lights as detailed below.

The operator should then define the limit of the re-paint window; this is 
done with the laser cursor and the trackerball.  First the lower left limits 
(South West corner) of the required window is visited with the laser cursor.  
Then, careful movement towards the upper-right of window (North East corner) 
is performed with the window being displayed with the red laser in 
refresh on the photochromic screen.  Successful confirmation and acceptance of 
the window definition is achieved with FB4 to issue the 'OK' command.  The 
Lasertrak will then re-paint out all lines which  have been digitised within 
the defined window.  The two alternatives to the use of 'OK' (FB4) could have 
been (FB1) to redefine the window's location again and cancelling the previous 
definition or 'ABA' (FB16) to abandon window repaint altogether and return to 
main mode.

.LE; ^&LOC - locate nearest captured feature for simple edit operation\&

.P; It is suggested that most edit operations on digitised files are best 
performed on bona-fide editing work stations such as the Laser-Scan LITES 
system.  However, some simple operations can be performed on existing 
digitised lines within Laseraid, though these operations can be slow and are 
restricted either to total deletion or to re-paint-out.  These two functions are 
defined by appropriate function buttons as described below.

.P; Entry into Laseraid's simple editing mode is achieved from the close-up 
screen keyboard with the command
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*LOC\*      <carriage return>
.BL
Before depressing <carriage return> the operator will have pointed the laser 
cursor to the vicinity of the desired feature for edit.  If Laseraid is unable 
to find the requested feature (and the search could take some time), it will 
remain in main mode.  If, however, line detection is successful, the feature 
found will be refreshed in red on the photochromic display and LOCATE mode 
will be entered - confirmed by the function button pattern of lights as shown 
below:

Using the command 'ZTI' will artificially reset all timers to zero and the 
clock will commence counting from this point on.  All items of timing are 
zeroed by ZTI except the TOTAL item which remains unchanged.  Initially, ZTI 
is run automatically on each occasion that Laseraid is invoked.

.LE; ^&ZIJ - clear the junction list\&

.P; The action of the keyboard command 'ZIJ' is to clear all entries in the current 
junction list.  This will cause 'GNF' (FB8) to have no effect and this 
situation will continue throughout the time that the junction list is empty.  
The junction list  will begin to re-fill as more junctions are recognised 
from subsequent digitising.  All junction entries which are removed from the 
list by 'ZIJ' cannot be recreated during the current digitising session.  
It is possible to reconstruct a list by terminating Laseraid with 
'EOS' and re-starting it again; this action provides a 
junction list in the form that it appeared prior to the original 'ZIJ' 
being issued. 

.LE; ^&PCF r. Move photochromic film by r frames\&

.P; The action of this command is to move the photochromic film on to a new 
frame, thereby removing the effects of any previous paint-outs.  The command 
is entered from the close-up keyboard and can take two forms, viz
.BL
.CENTRE; PCF          <carriage return>
.BL
.CENTRE; PCF r        <carriage return>

.P; The first option is to scroll by the default number of frames (which is 
one frame only).  The second option is to scroll by a defined number of frames 
supplied in the argument r. It should be pointed out that once the photochromic
film has been moved to a new frame (either by PCF or by the Main control
panel switch) it is necessary to remeasure the control  points in Measure mode
to re-register the paint out data with the digitised map data.

.LE; ^&CAN - Cancel (i.e. delete) the last feature digitised\&

.P; Whilst digitising both in line following or edge following modes, 
features can be abandoned before they have been accepted in the help mode by 
the command 'ABA' (FB16).  Once accepted, though, each feature is stored in 
the IFF file and can only be cancelled either by ^&post-hoc\& editing, by the 
LOCate option (see item n above) or by the command 'CAN'.  The 'CAN' command 
is issued in Laseraid main mode and deletes the immediate previous line to be 
digitised and accepted.  It is only operable if no attempt has been made to 
commence digitising the next feature.

.LE; ^&WHA - print out job details 'WHAT'\&

.P; The action is to detail on the close-up screen a summary of various 
descriptions of the current job in progress.  Examples include the operator's 
identification, the IFF output file, the parameter (patch) file, etc.

.LE; ^&ADJ - adjust system parameters\&

.P; This activates the facility to view and edit the parameter file which
govern line following characteristics. Details of the use and adjustment of 
parameter files can be found in the Laseraid Reference Manual.

.LE; ^&EOS - end of session\&

.P; This is the Laseraid program exit.  It terminates the Lasertrak
controlling software (though it does not power-down the hardware - see section
11.0).  All output IFF files are closed and the system parameter file is
up-dated with the new parameters obtained from this session. 

.LE; ^&PFB - print the feature codes and line types currently associated with 
FB1, FB2, FB3, FB5, FB6, FB7\&

.P; Para (a) in this section has described the association between line-type
and feature coding and six function buttons in main mode.  These feature codes
and line types are set appropriately by the operator and this information is
stored in the system's current parameter file for use in future digitising
sessions.  Paragraphs (w) and (x) below explain how the feature codes and line
types associated with the function buttons can be modified. 

.P; The keyboard command 'PFB' enables the operator to determine what the 
current settings for line types and feature codes are with respect to the six 
line type buttons:  FB1, FB2, FB3, FB5, FB6, FB7.  On issuing the command 
'PFB' from the close-up keyboard a summary report of the current settings is 
displayed on the close-up screen.  A typical example is shown below:
.test page 10

.FILL
.NOKEEP

.P; This report can be interpreted in the following way.  'FC' is Laser-Scan's 
IFF entry for interpolation or feature code.  Thus, currently FB1 has feature 
code 1, FB7 has feature code 30 etc.  Similarly, line type 5 (in Laseraid's 
current parameter file - see the Lasertrak Reference Manual) is associated with 
FB1, and line type 2 is associated with FB5, FB6.  Confirmation of changes 
is equally possible with 'PFB'.

.LE; ^&FCF n m - Modify feature codes associated with function buttons\&

.P; Readers are referred initially to para (v) above.  The FCF command enables 
operators to modify the feature codes associated with the line type function 
buttons FB1, FB2, FB3, FB5, FB6, FB7.  The command is typed whilst in main 
mode from the close-up keyboard and takes two numeric arguments (separated by 
spaces).  The first argument, n, refers to the function button number to be 
changed; it can only take either of the values 1,2,3,5,6,7.  The second 
argument, m, refers to the FC (feature code) to be set and should be 
an integer in the range 0 to 32767.

.LE; ^&TYF n m - Modify line-types associated with function buttons\&

.P; Readers are referred initially to the previous paragraphs.  The TYF command 
enables operators to modify the line types associated with line type function 
buttons.  Line types are defined within the current Laseraid parameter (or 
patch) files and exist as a collection of special scan parameter settings 
within a table of values.  Each column in the table (known as the "type-tables
") refers to a type of line and these are limited to seven columns and hence 
seven line types.  The Lasertrak Reference Manual gives more details on line types 
and scan parameter tuning.  TYF if typed whilst in main mode from the close-up 
screen keyboard and takes two numeric arguments (separated by spaces).  The 
first argument, n, refers to the function button number to be changed; it can 
only take either of the values 1,2,3,5,6,7.  The second argument, m, refers to 
the line type corresponding to the relevant column in the type tables; it 
takes the value 1-6 inclusive.  Confirmation of the change is possible with 
'PFB' - see above.


.END LIST
.PAGE
.HL 2 ^&HELP MODE\&

.P; This section describes the nature of help mode.  This is the software 
level which is always available for operator assistance and intervention 
whilst automatic line-following is taking place.  It is also the level which 
Laseraid will enter when it stops itself to request the help of the operator.  
Thus, help mode provides stage 3 of the Lasertrak digitising cycle (as was 
described in section 10.1); it is here where lines are digitised, verified 
and accepted.

.P; Confirmation that Laseraid has entered help mode is given with the 
following pattern of function button lights.

.P; Help mode is entered initially before auto-line following begins but after 
line-type selection has been made for each line to be digitised (see 10.3.1a).  
Once the operator has selected his desired line to be digitised and registered 
its type from main mode, the system enters help mode immediately to seek 
further assistance for the automatic line following.  This situation assumes 
that the main mode command option 'FIN' is not operative at the time (see 
section 10.3.1 para (g)).  Help mode is also entered after a line following 
pause due either to operator or software intervention.


.P; The commands available in help mode, as usual are given by both function 
buttons and the close-up keyboard:  the most widely used being available on 
function buttons with the remainder available from the close-up keyboard.  
Help mode commands are described below.

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"
.LE; ^&ONE (FB3) - proceed with a single scan\&

.P; This facility is used in association with the laser 
cursor "tram-lines"; these are the parallel lines whose direction and length 
is controlled by the trackerball.  The orientation of the "tram-lines" should 
be adjusted so that the Lasertrak is informed of the direction in which 
scanning ought to begin.  Depressing FB3 to issue the command 'ONE' then 
instructs the Lasertrak to produce a single scan in the direction determined 
by the tramlines. If the tramlines are not present on the screen, then ONE
command will produce them on the screen. Once a single scan has been 
performed, line-following pauses once again in help mode and displays in 
red refresh on the photochromic screen the portion of the line detected.

.P; The use of the ONE command on all occasions is very useful in confirming 
to the operator that line-following would perform correctly if it were allowed 
to proceed automatically.  It provides the operator with 'peace-of-mind'.

.LE; ^&GO (FB4) - proceed normally with automatic line-following\&

.P; Depressing FB4 in help mode issues the 'GO' command; this is the Laseraid 
instruction to commence automatic line-following and attempt to digitise the 
current feature easily and efficiently.  Automatic line following is seen on 
the photochromic screen as a sequential series of single scans (with no pause 
in between each).  The scans should be seen to track along the current line 
being digitised with little or no delay in progression along the line.

.P; Whilst automatic line-following is taking place, operators are advised to 
monitor its progress visually and intervene on the following occasion.

                         mode where the tracker ball 
                         can be used to 'wind back'
                         to the problem area in order 
                         to re-scan. A full explanation
                         of 'rolling mode' is in para h
                        

.END LITERAL
.END LIST

.LE; ^&NXT (FB8)  display possible alternative paths available\&

.P; The NeXT command on FB8 is useful in particularly complex areas of maps to 
be digitised where there are several alternate paths or lines to follow in 
close proximity.  The action of 'NXT' is to display to the operator (as short 
portions of line in red refresh on the photochromic screen) all path options 
available for line-following at the laser cursor's current position.  Repeated 
pressing of 'NXT' (FB8) cycles repeatedly through the path options.  Once the 
desired path is selected operators can attempt further line-following with 
either 'ONE' (FB3) or 'GO' (FB4).

.P; When junction recognition is operative the command 'NXT' (FB8) has 
an enhanced use since it is able to select and display to operators (with red 
refresh on the photochromic screen) all directions detected which enter and 
exit the current junction position.  This provides a fast and flexible method 
to direct the line-following through a network of lines; in most cases, it 
obviates the use of the trackerball and tramlines and is particularly useful 
when used in conjunction with 'GNF' (FB8) in main mode.  The proviso for the 
use of 'NXT' in this way is that junctions must first have been scanned and 
recognised before 'NXT' becomes operative.  Further, it is of no use when a 
junction has been fixed manually with 'MAJ' .  In such 
situations, there is no information in the junction list of the directions of 
entrant lines - NXT needs this information and it can only be achieved when a 
junction has been scanned and recognised automatically.
.P; If the operator wishes to stop the automatic scanning at the next junction
in order to change the direction of the scan using 'NXT', then FB15 is 
depressed once the junction has been accepted. The default wait between junction

acceptance and continuation is set at 0.2 seconds.

.P; Continuous depressing of 'NXT' in help mode at junction positions cycles 
repeatedly through all the entrant/exit lines which have been detected.  Once 
the appropriate exit has been chosen, the 'GO' command on FB4 will restart 
auto line-following.

	
.LE; ^&MP (FB10) - insert a Master Point at the cursor's current position\&

.P; The 'MP' command on FB10 provides the operator with a means to force a
digitised point to be fixed at specific, defined locations.  It is useful, for
example, to include digitised points manually across connections over large
gaps in a digitised source line.  Operators need merely position the laser
cursor over the desired point location and depress FB10 to issue the 'MP'
command. Points may be registered by subsequent pressing of FB10.
Master points are equally able to be created
manually on the close-up screen with the keyboard command 'CLO'.  The operator
should direct the laser cursor to vicinity of the desired point location and
type on the keyboard: 

.BL
.CENTRE; ^*CLO\*      <carriage return> 

.P; The action is for the close-up screen to show a greatly enlarged 
impression of the source document from which an accurate fix can be made with 
the close-up screen's cursor.  Readers are referred to para (k) in this 
section for details of CLOse-up digitising of points.  Once the laser cursor 
is positioned accurately, use of FB10 will create the Master Point in that 
location.

.P; Several Master Points may be created using the close-up screen by typing 
at the keyboard the command:
.BL
.CENTRE; MAN      <carriage return>

.P; This action again produces a close-up view on the close-up screen, but
this time each press of the space bar creates a Master Point, from the
close-up keyboard as the cursor's location on the close-up screen.  The
command 

.BL
.CENTRE; E
.BL; ends the sequence.

.LE; ^&HOP (FB11) - jump over inappropriate data or portions of poor source 
linework\&

.P; The HOP command on FB11 is used on occasions where it is required to
ignore certain areas of the source document.  Typical regions to be ignored
could be unrequired symbols (such as markers along a line's course or
elevation details on contours) or they could comprise poor portions of line
work which the scanner is unable to detect successfully by automatic
line-following.  In either event line-following will have been paused (perhaps
by operator intervention FB15 or by software request for help) and the system
will be in help mode. 

.P; The 'HOP' command is invoked by depressing FB11 and the tram lines are 
seen on the photochromic display.  The trackerball is used to re-position the 
laser cursor (in this case the tramlines) to the desired new location from 
which automatic line-following can recommence and this can be re-started with 
either 'ONE' (FB3) or 'GO' (FB4).  The former option is desirable initially to 
confirm that the Lasertrak has re-detected the correct line before automatic 
line-following is released with 'GO' (FB4).

.LE; ^&END (FB12)  Accept the feature and return to main mode\&

.P; Once the end of a feature has been reached - it could be because there is 
no more line to follow, or because a loop feature has closed or due to an 
operator pause instruction - it is necessary to accept the feature before it 
is stored in the output IFF file and the next feature can be started.

.P; At this stage, the operator can either accept or reject the feature:  he 
will have monitored line-following progress and will be able to see the 
current buffer of digitised coordinates in red refresh on the photochromic 
display.  The feature is rejected with 'ABA' (FB16) - see (i) below.  The 
feature is accepted with 'END' (FB12).  As soon as the 'END' command is issued 
the feature is stored in the output IFF file and it is painted out from the 
photochromic display (if the Paint Out Suppress 'POS' option is not operative 
from main mode (FB9)).  Control immediately returns to Laseraid main mode and 
the feature serial numbers (and elevation ancillary codes, if relevant) are 
updated if the ANF (and AHT) commands are set appropriately (see section 
10.2.1 and 10.2.2).

.P; Once a feature has been accepted with 'END', it can no longer be rejected 
easily and such operations are best left to ^&post-hoc\& editing processes.  
Users are referred to the main-mode command 'CAN' (via keyboard only) in which 
the latest feature accepted can be deleted immediately - though this is only 
possible if no attempt has been made to start digitising the next feature (see 
section 10.3.2).

.LE; ^&MOV (FB14) - change cursor mode between "change angle" and "change 
position"\&

.P; During operator intervention phases of Lasertrak digitising, the cursor 
takes on two states of appearance or "movements" from trackerball.  One 
state is the movement of the cursor's physical position; this is possible when 
it is a 'cross' and can also be possible (for example with the 'HOP' command - 
see item (e) above) when it is the 'tram-lines' symbol.  The second state is 
only possible with the tram-lines cursor and this is the facility where the 
trackerball can be used to rotate the cursor's angle with its base position 
anchored in a fixed screen location.

.P; The 'MOV' command available on FB14 in help mode instructs the laser 
cursor to flip cyclically between each state of operation - angle and
position.  The facility is useful when operators wish to pass over poor line 
work or chain on to other lines.  It is very similar in concept to the 'HOP' 
command but does not fix master points on either side of the gaps being 
jumped.  If the 'MOVE' command was to be used in a similar way to 'HOP' it 
would be necessary to include master points where appropriate with the command 
'MP' on FB10.

.LE; ^&BB (FB15) pause line-following and back track manually along line 
captured\&

.P; FB15 has two important functions during the digitising process.  Firstly, 
it provides  the operator with an option to pause 
automatic line-following which will have 
been started originally with the command 'GO' on FB4.  This line-following 
interrupt stops auto-digitising and the red laser displays in refresh on the 
photochromic display the current 'buffer' of digitised coordinates.  The 
operator can then re-start auto-digitising again with 'GO' (FB4) or he can 
intervene with other options such as 'HOP' (FB11), 'ONE' (FB3), 'END' (FB12), 
'ABA' (FB16). Secondly, he can backtrack along the line digitised thus 
far to possible sources of error.

.P; The rolling mode can be obtained by pressing BB (FB15) for a second time.
This will enable the tracker ball and redefine FB15 to become BAC which will
enable the operator to delete master points individually with each consequent
press of FB15. The tracker ball can also be used to back track along the 
digitised line - deleting master points on the way.

.P; Simultaneously, when rolling mode is entered (by pressing FB15 twice)
function button 8 (FB8) is also redefined  as LJN - Locate 
previous JunctioN. This
is only relevant if the operator is digitising using a line type which has 
enabled junction recognition.
Once rolling mode has been entered, the operator is able to roll back the 
trackerball to the previous junction. Depressing 'LJN' (FB8) within the 
tolerance of the search scan redefines FB8 to become 'NXT' thus enabling the 
operator to chose a different arm to scan along. FB4 will restart the line 
following.

.LE; ^&ABA (FB16) Abandon help mode\&

.P; The 'ABA' command on FB16 is the usual panic option in help mode.  It is 
only operable when auto-line following is paused and its effect is to cancel 
all digitised achieved to-date on the current feature and return to main mode. 
 Thus it provides a reject option for a digitised line (as opposed to accept 
with 'END' (FB12)).  Rejection of a line feature or abandoning help mode for 
some other reason in this way does not increment feature serial numbers (or 
elevation codes if relevant) and tram-line cursors are returned to the 'cross' 
symbol in main mode.  'ABA' will not work whilst line-following is active; it 
must first be paused with 'BB' on FB15.

.LE; ^&B - display on close-up screen a digitised back-log\&

.P; This facility is included in this introductory guide under help mode 
commands for convenience, though strictly speaking it is a ^&macro\& rather 
than a ^&command\&.  The concept of Laseraid macros is not discussed in detail 
in this document.  Briefly a macro is a user-defined sequence of Laseraid 
basic commands held under an assumed macro name.  On supplying an instruction 
to invoke the macro - which is achieved by supplying its assumed name - the 
sequence of commands are run in turn automatically.

.P; The macro 'B' is an example of such a sequence of commands; to a novice 
operator, there need be no distinctions made between commands and macros.  The 
function of the macro 'B' for all versions of Laseraid help mode is to 
display on the close-up screen the vector representation of the previous 
buffer of digitised line-work.  The position of fixed master points is also 
shown on the display as crosses.  The facility is useful for operator's to 
confirm successful digitising before a feature is accepted with 'END' (FB12).  
'B' is only available from the close-up keyboard and line-following must have 
been paused by either operator or software intervention.

.LE; ^&CLO - reposition laser cursor accurately via close-up screen\&

.P; This facility is particularly useful when wishing to register the cursors 
location very accurately - perhaps to digitise Master Points (MP-FB10).  Under 
normal circumstances, the positioning of the laser cursor is only as good as 
can be determined by the operator's visual inspection of the photochromic 
screen and his movement of the trackerball.  The keyboard command 'CLO' 
provides a means of more accurate cursor positioning.  Operator's first direct 
the laser with trackerball to the vicinity of the required position.  The 
command 'CLO' is then issued from the close-up keyboard which instructs the 
Lasertrak to scan the vicinity of cursor position and show a facsimile of what 
has been seen on the close-up screen.  Accurate cursor positioning is then 
possible by means of adjusting the close-up cursor to the required location 
and pressing the space-bar.  This action moves the laser cursor to the correct 
position on the photochromic screen.

.LE; ^&MAN and E - multiple entry of Master Points from close-up screen and 
keyboard\&

.P; Several Master Points may be created using the close-up terminal by typing
the command 'MAN' at the keyboard.  Laseraid must be in help mode and
line-following should be paused.  The action of the command MANual draws a
close-up facsimile on the close-up screen.  The close-up cursor can then assign
accurately the required Master Point locations and each time the space bar is
depressed, a Master Point is created.  The command 'E' from the keyboard ends
the sequence. 

The combination of inserting manual master points and manual junctions is 
described in the following section.

.LE; ^&MAJ n - Define a junction position manually\&

.P; There may be instances when operators require to force a junction feature 
in locations where laseraid cannot define one for itself 
automatically.  Usual reasons are from the effects of poor-quality line-work, 
short gaps or dirt at the junction position or inappropriate Lasertrak tuning.


.P; Manual definition of a junction can be performed in two ways at present 
and though both involve the use of several commands, it is the command
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*MAJ n\*      
.BL
which is fundamental to the junction creation process.  MAJ takes one 
argument which is numeric and this represents the number of lines (or arms)
which are entrant to the junction being created.  A 'T' junction, for example,
has three entrant lines and hence it is created with the command
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*MAJ 3\*
.BL
'MAJ' can only be entered from the close-up keyboard and line-following must 
have been paused with the system in help mode.

.P; There are two ways in which manual junctions can be created - one involves 
the use of the laser cursor on the photochromic screen and the second is for 
very accurate positioning involving the close-up screen.  Both procedures are 
described in steps below.

.LIST
.LE; ^&Manual junctions from the position of the laser-cursor\&

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",RL,")"
.LE; Position the laser cursor over the required location for the junction 
point position as accurately as possible with the trackerball,

.LE; enter master point mode by pressing FB10. Create a master point at 
that location by issuing a 'MP' command on FB10.

.LE; convert the master point from (ii) above into a junction point of known 
number of entrant lines by typing at the close-up keyboard
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*MAJ n\*
.BL
where n is the determined number of entrant lines.

.LE; a junction point at the cursor's location will have been created and an 
entry made in the junction list.

.END LIST

.LE; ^&Manual junctions with the use of the close-up terminal\&

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",RL,")"
.LE; If an automatic scan is unsuccessful, then it may be necessary to
generate a manual junction.

.LE; ask for a close-up facsimile of the vicinity of the laser cursor to be 
drawn on the close-up screen.  This is achieved by typing at the close-up 
keyboard
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*MAN\*      <carriage return>
.BL
The result is a close-up facsimile and the appearance of the close-up screen 
cursor.

.LE; using the 'joy stick' on the close-up terminal, position the close-up 
cursor over the exact position where the manual junction is required.

.LE; using the keyboard space bar, the junction can be placed and
then the letter 'E' to end the junction point. Since only one point is to 
be fixed, it can be typed immediately.  The
alternative could have been to create several points - these would be done by
a combination of the close-up cursor and the keyboard space bar.  The sequence
of points created, though, should always be terminated with 'E'. 

.LE; convert the Master Point that has been created into a junction with the 
keyboard command
.BL
.CENTRE; ^*MAJ n\*
.BL
where n represents a numeric argument to define the determined number of 
entrant lines

.LE; the junction has now been created and it will have an entry in the 
junction list.

.END LIST

.P; In both methods for manual junction creation, there are a number of 
conditions and disadvantages, viz:

.LITERAL

     -   'NXT' (FB8) has no effect because manual junctions 
	 have no details on the direction of entrant lines.

     -   once all lines entrant to the manual junction have 
	 been digitised, it will not be deleted from the 
	 junction list.  It remains there forever, or until 
	 the total list is cleared with 'ZIJ'.

     -   digitising of lines which exit the manual junction 
	 is achieved by 'ONE' (FB3) to determine direction 
	 with the tram-lines and 'GO' (FB4) to commence 
	 auto-line-following.

     -   when a manual junction is encountered by Laseraid,
	 the message 'Manual junction' appears on the close-up
	 screen and tramlines will be produced. The direction
	 of line following can be chosen with the tracker ball
	 and line following resumed with FB4

can be edited, plotted or otherwise manipulated.
It is invoked by the command:

.HL 1 ^&SYSTEM HARDWARE POWER-DOWN PROCEDURES\&

.P; The instructions which follow explain the procedures necessary to power-
down the Lasertrak hardware; they assume that the system is currently switched
on with power being supplied  to the projection system, the lasers and the
water cooling unit.  It is recommended that at most the Lasertrak only be
switched on and off once per day.  It is not necessary (indeed not
recommended) to power-down the hardware each time it is not required for use. 
Lasertrak should only be powered-down at the end of a day's session. 

.P; The procedure to power-down Lasertrak involves following a series of steps 
in sequence as are described below.

.LIST
.DISPLAY ELEMENTS "(",LL,")"

.LE; Switch the Lasertrak to disable off-line by positioning the machine
STATUS switch on the main control panel (*B11) to the disable position. 

.LE; Depress green master on/off button to power-down the machine:  
confirmation is given by the extinguishing of this power light (*B10).

.LE; Turn anti-clockwise to vertical the master power-lock key on the 
Lasertrak main panel (*B9).

.LE; Switch off water supply for the laser cooling system.

.END LIST

.P; The Lasertrak is now powered-down confirmed by the extinguishing of all 
lights and the darkness of the photochromic screen (*A2).  The Lasertrak can 
now be left in this state with confidence until it is required again, at which 
time the hardware should be powered-up in the normal way (see section 5).
