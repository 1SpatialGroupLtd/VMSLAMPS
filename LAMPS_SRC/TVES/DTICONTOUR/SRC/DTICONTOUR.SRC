C DTICONTOUR is the DTMPROCESS grid bilinear hardcopy contouring
C program. It operates on the DTI file and provides labelling and
C plotter output. The output is in IFF format.

C Parameters:
	INCLUDE	'LSL$DTMCREATESYS:MESPAR.PAR'

C Common:
	INCLUDE	'LSL$CMNDTICONTOUR:ADDRESS.CMN'
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNDTICONTOUR:ERRMSG.CMN'
	INCLUDE '($SSDEF)/NOLIST'
C
C Functions:
	LOGICAL CALC_SCALING	! calculate scaling, data sectioning
	LOGICAL DTMJPI		! process info. - introduction
	LOGICAL GET_CMDS	! command interface
	LOGICAL CLOSE_FILES	! close all files
	LOGICAL BRIDGE		! bridging function for CONGRD
	INTEGER	SIGCHS		! # signif. characters in string
C
C W/s
	LOGICAL OK		! function return
	LOGICAL	CONTOUR		! actually do the contouring?
	LOGICAL CLOSED		! files closed?
