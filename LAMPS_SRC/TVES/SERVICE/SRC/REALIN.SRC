C
***	MODULE REALIN
***	IDENT 09AU93
C
C	Copyright: Laser-Scan Ltd,Cambridge,England
C
C	Created from PANACEA's REALIN			TJH 23-Jul-1986
C
C	Copied from DTMCREATE service to TVES service	 JB  9-Aug-1993
C
C	Prompts for command and expects reals in response. Any found 
C	are put into /CMDCOM/REALAR. On return /CMDCOM/CMDRCT is
C	the number of entries made in REALAR. Function returns
C	.TRUE. if all is well, or .FALSE. if an error (or ^Z) on read
C	occurs.
