C This routine is used as a buffer between IFFBDY and STDRAW.
C STDRAW needs to know if the block of coords it is sent is the
C final block for that feature but IFFBDY doesn't know whether it
C is or not until it reaches an EF entry. Consequently this
C routine keeps a block in hand until LAST is set (ie. EF found).
C Scaling and offsetting is performed on the data while it is
C being buffered.
