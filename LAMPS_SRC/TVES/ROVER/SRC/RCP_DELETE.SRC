C 	Read the RCP identifier (up to 10 characters long)
C	Skipping any leading spaces.

C	Find a match for this identifier

C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C	Mark as deleted
C	This is done by setting the first character in the identifier
C	to '!'
C	Note this is permanent and the RCP cannot be subsequently 
C	undeleted.
