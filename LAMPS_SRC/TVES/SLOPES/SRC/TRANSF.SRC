C:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
C Uses matrix T to get (X_OUT,Y_OUT), the TRANSFormation of (X_IN,Y_IN)
C:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
C
	X_OUT = T(1,1)*X_IN + T(1,2)*Y_IN + T(1,3)
	Y_OUT = T(2,1)*X_IN + T(2,2)*Y_IN + T(2,3)
