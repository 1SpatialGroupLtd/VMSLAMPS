.le;The image is processed in a number of square patches each small
enough to reside entirely within in on-line memory (201 X 201)

.le;Each patch overlaps its right and upper neighgbours by one pixel
so that no part of any boundary which lies on a patch edge can escape
detection. 

.le;Each pixel in the patch matrix is assigned the index of the given
range to which its height belongs. Pixels at heights not within any of
the given height ranges are given the negativive index of the range
above. 

.le;A corresponding matrix is set up showing directly which top and
right pixel edges are area boundaries. 

.le;Every boundary is followed through the matrix by scanning the matrix
row by row from the bottom to the top, looking for boundary junctions
and following each edge from this junction through the matrix until it
meets a boundary junction or a patch edge. 

.le;As each link and node arises it is placed into a link-node structure
in which every link references its two end nodes and every node
references all of the links which join there. 

.le;Points are held in a linked list to allow foor subsequent ease of
point insertion and deletion. 

.le;Node to link references are held in a linked list of link indices,
signed positive for links leaving the node and negative for links
entering. The reason for not using a fixed size array to allow up to
just four links joining at each node is that although four is the
maximum degree of a node in a rectanglar grid, later on nodes may
sometimes be required to be combined in which case there is no fixed
limit on the number of links which can eventually join at a single
node. 

.le;After all patches have been edge-followed, the link-node structure
is revised so that all 2 arm nodes are eliminated except where they
constitute the only node in a closed loop boundary which contains no
junctions. 

.le;The left/right coded link-node structure is now written to disc
file. 

.le;If centre-line formation is not in use, this link-node structured
file is now used, together with data still on line, to create a
closed-boundary representation file.
