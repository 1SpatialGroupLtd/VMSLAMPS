C	Function: 
C	Called if a band or series of sampling bands have been defined.
C	Tests whether the highest band is of sufficient width to extend
C	either to the sector arc (if a sector distance has been
C	specified), or to the corners of the rectangular area of
C	interest.
C	The width of the final band is modified if necessary, and the
C	user is told of this action.
