***	IDENT	31JA90
***	MODULE	MTISPC

C	Copyright : Laser-Scan Laboratories Ltd., Cambridge, England
C	Created   : Andrew C Morris			24-Apr-89

C Description
C	Spaces forwards by NUM_BLOCKS in file on unit DMT_INPUT_LUN, and
C	returns LSL__NORMAL for success, other for failure (see code).
C	Will not space backwards, because this is very awkward with an
C	unformatted tape.
