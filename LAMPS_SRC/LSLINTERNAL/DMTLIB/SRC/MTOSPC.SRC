***	IDENT	31JA90
***	MODULE	MTOSPC

C	Copyright : Laser-Scan Laboratories Ltd., Cambridge, England
C	Created   : Andrew C Morris			24-Apr-89

C Description
C	Spaces forwards by NUM_BLOCKS in file on unit DMT_OUTPUT_LUN,
C	and returns LSL__NORMAL for success, other for failure (see
C	code). Will not space backwards, because this is very awkward
C	with an unformatted tape.
