C The meanings of the common variables are as follows:
C
C ISHED is a list of pins,each a single integer. The value of the
C	integer is (pin number) + (256 * ic number)
C	(ic number zero is reserved for the edge connectors);
C	special values VCC, GND are defined in WIREWRAP.HDR
C A single network is a consecutive sequence of pins, terminated
C by the value  -1.
	DO I=1,MAXSHED
	   ISHED(I) = 0
	ENDDO
C
C ICLIST is a list of IC names, as MAXICS by 10 array of bytes:
	DO 20 I=1,MAXICS
	   DO 20 J=1,10
	      ICLIST(I,J) = 0
20	CONTINUE
C
C  ICPTR is an index by IC number into the IC library, ie ICPTR(I) is
C the library number corresponding to IC number I.
	DO I=1,MAXICS
	   ICPTR(I) = 0
	ENDDO
C
C ICLIB is an array of integers, MAXICS by 64 (up to 64 pins per IC),
C representing the pin functions of each IC type used. Values are
C calculated by LIBSET routine.
	DO 40 I= 1,MAXICS
	   DO 40 J=1,64
	      ICLIB(I,J) = 0
40	CONTINUE
C
C ICPINS is a list of the number of pins on each IC type in the library.
	DO I=1,MAXICS
	   ICPINS(I) = 0
	ENDDO

C EUROCD is set TRUE by INPUT when it encounters the directive

	EUROCD = .FALSE.

C MLTBUS is set TRUE by INPUT when it encounters the directive
C	MUL[tibus] in the schedule it's reading
	MLTBUS = .FALSE.

	POS3DG = .FALSE.
