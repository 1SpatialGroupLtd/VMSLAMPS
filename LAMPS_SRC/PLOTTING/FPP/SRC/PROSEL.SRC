C Function to process the feature code selections and
C deselections before plotting the IFF file. The bit-map
C may just need updating (if at all), or if a new FRT file
C has been read in (ie. new group definitions), then the bit-map
C should be re-initialised.

C If the FRT file has been changed then revert to deselect mode.

C Now that the group names are defined we can process the feature-
C code select and deselect commands that have been stored up.

C Error.

C Now clear the buffer holding the stored SEL/DES commands.
1000	SELPTR=0		! throw away the stored SEL/DES cmds.
