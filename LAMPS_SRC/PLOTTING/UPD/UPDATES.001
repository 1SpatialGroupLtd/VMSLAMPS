		Add LABEL FC to label with feature code

 9-Jan-1987	FPP,GETTXT,STDRAW.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		FPP calls new routine GETTXT to load address of
		routine DRAW_TEXT in shareable image LSL$TEXT_ROUTINE.
		This is used to by STDRAW to draw texts if present, and
		is called via CALLR in COMTBL.MAR (intended
		for Hydro soundings).

 6-Jan-1987	OUTBLK.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Only draw pattern filled areas if +PATTERN

18-Dec-1986	OUTBLK,SETCOL,SETLIN,FPP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt

		hatch width and separation in SETCOL for all features.

11-Dec-1986	OBEY.SRC,COMTBL.MAR,TITLE.SRC(new) - Bill James
		Add new TITLE commands for decorating the plot. See
		documentation

24-Nov-1986	OBEY.SRC,COMTBL.MAR	- Clarke Brunt
		Use LITES2 style commands where possible - all old ones
		retained as synonyms - see new documentation

24-Nov-1986	PSTOSZ.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid SUBRNG when size defaulted to 24 - still used
		old size to access OSPENW

24-Nov-1986	INTERP.SRC		- Jamie Hulme
		fix bug in call to INTRPL - pass .TRUE. and .FALSE., 
		not MCCON

21-Nov-1986	FPP.SRC,EXCEPTION.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		add exception handler - deal with floating point stuff,
		pass through DEBUG and ACCVIO unchanged, water down the
		severity of everything else.

21-Nov-1986	OUTBLK.SRC		- Jamie Hulme
		check there are points to output

21-Nov-1986	various			- Jamie Hulme
		Use COORDLIB for curves - add INTERPOLATION AKI/MCC,
		TOLERANCE CURDRAW commands.

27-Sep-1986	INTRPL.SRC,IFFBDY.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Remove INTRPL bugs for small STs in closed loops,
		and make INTRPL similar to that in LITES2

 7-Jul-1986	FPPDAT.CMN,FPP.SRC,OBEY.SRC	- Ron Russell
		use RDFILN rather than RDFILT, and so get version 4
		filenames

 3-Jul-1986	SETCOL.SRC, SETLIN.SRC	Ron Russell
		Set hardware line in SETCOL, not SETLIN, so
		that they can be used for symbols and texts

24-Jun-1986	STDRAW.SRC		Clarke Brunt
		Use hardware for symbol strings (as for GT 7)

May/June 1986	many and various	Ron Russell
		1) Pattern generation moved to FRTLIB
		2) Use of extended FRTLIB - 
		   a) H/W symbols and line types
		   b) data for fill area hatchng fron FRT entries
		   c) offset linear features (size entry in FRT)
		3) ROTATE takes an angle
		4) PAUSE command
		5) SELECT FSN command
		6) SELECT FC and SELECT LAYER
		7) SHOW SELECTION command

28-Apr-1986	IFFBDY.SRC		Clarke Burunt
		Call ANGSIZ earlier for symbol strings, otherwise does
		all but last ST at zero size

16-Apr-1986	ANGSIZ.SRC		Clarke Brunt
		Don't use unset variable TH for text height when
		+TXSIZE and -POINT in operation. (Used size 0)

14-Apr-1986	PSTOSZ.SRC		Ron Russell
		Simply take line width from text height; don't do
		fancy things that LITES(1) did

		ANGSIZ.SRC		Ron Russell
		Subtract 1/3rd of a character width when working out
		size of text to get box size

 9-Mar-1986	various			Clarke Brunt/Dave Catlow
		Add +/-CONTOUR SELECT to plot only index contours
		and +/-LABEL INDEX to label only index contours

28-Feb-1986	various.SRC		Clarke Brunt
		Increase graphics buffer to 8192 points for large
		fill areas.
		New command HATCH to set fill area hatch line width and
		spacing (for GKSLDLIB implementations).

28-Feb-1986	IFFBDY.SRC		Clarke Brunt
		Force RTRN onto edges correctly. Could cause plot
		distortion if area was indeed larger than screen.

20-Dec-1985	IFFBDY.SRC		Clarke Brunt
		Clear GOTLST on invisible line, so that invisibles work
		in patterned lines.

 4-Dec-1985	FPP.SRC			Clarke Brunt
		Fix bug in explicit SRI and TRI (from 2-Dec-1985)

 2-Dec-1985	FPP.SRC,OBEY.SRC	Clarke Brunt
		Amend interface to command files (was awful!)
		Check for trailing '-' on all commands with optional
		arguments. Skip rest of line on all errors.

28-Nov-1985	IFFBDY.SRC	Clarke Brunt
		Test RTRN in correct order (as RA entry)

26-Oct-1985	IFFBDY.SRC	Clarke Brunt
		Correct setting of window/viewport when rotating
		(Y components of RTRN backwards)

15-Oct-1985	various		Clarke Brunt
		Add WINDOW and CLIP and NOOVERRIDE commands.
		Do labelling at start of line features and in the
		same colour as the feature.
		GKS world window and viewport are now set to the
		sheet equivalent of the RAnge entry (or from WINDOW
		command) so that clipping can optionally take place.
		Add many things to BLKDAT (its NOT GOOD ENOUGH to just
		assume things will be 0 or .FALSE.!).
		Make CONTOUR arguments compulsory so that they don't
		take garbage for missing args.
		Make absence of argument to LABCOL,LABANG,LABSIZ cancel
		the option.
		I believe that there should always be a way of undoing
		the effect of a command in this program.

27-Sep-1985	various		Clarke Brunt
		Remove offending INTEGER*2 in several places, especially
		for counting number of points in a feature!

		check that group name command table exists
		before trying to RDCOMM from it

		SETLIN.SRC,STDRAW.SRC,SUBSTT.SRC	- ACM
		Max NF (& ISQ) No. up to 65535

 26-Mar-1985	ANGSIZ.SRC,BLKDAT,IFFBDY,OBEY,PSTOSZ,STDRAW
		COMBTL.MAR,
		CURFT.CMN,DRAWIN.CMN		- Ron Russell
		Text justification	- [+/-] TXPOS
		Text size from IFF file	- [+/-] TXSIZE
		Text sizes in IFF files
		are in point sizes or mms/100	- [+/-] POINT

 23-Jan-1985	*.OPT		Clarke Brunt
		Use LDCPRLIB (roll) for Benson,
		    LDCPSLIB (sheet) for Calcomp.
		Neither should now need spurious ENLARGE

 22-Jan-1985    IFFBDY    D R Catlow
	        accepts contour heights as real (ACTYPE 3)

 4-Dec-1984	FPP.COM		- Tony J Ibbs
		add Sigma 6100 to the list of things which may have FPPs

 13-Nov-1984	IFFBDY,CHKST.SRC,CURFT.CMN
		-Dave Catlow
		Bugs concerning dummy features, and 1 point ST
		entries fixed.  TOTPTS calculated in IFFBDY added
		to common block CURFT and used to test line
		features in CHKST.

 6-Nov-1984	OBEY,IFFBDY,SETLAB.SRC,COMTBL.MAR,SELECT.CMN
		-Dave Catlow
	        Commands LABANG (angle of label), LABOFF (label
	  	x,y offset) and OVERRIDE (equating all entries
	 	in a layer to a specified feature code) added.
		Dummy NF entries treated correctly.
		Labels correctly positioned when ROTATE and
		CENTRE are set.

 6-Nov-1984	BLKDAT.SRC,IFFBDY,OBEY,DRAWIN.CMN,COMTBL.MAR
							- Clarke Brunt
		Add CENTRE command

 1-Nov-1984	IFFBDY,SETLAB.SRC	- Dave Catlow
		To allow labelling of symbols.
		Angle of label is 0.0 (unless LABANG is specifically
	        set)

30-Oct-1984	various.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Use longword bitmaps where necessary.
		
29-Oct-1984	SELECT.CMN		- Clarke Brunt
		Allow feature code to 32767. Make bitmaps longwords.

26-Oct-1984	DCCMD,OBEY.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Don't declare command tables (except EXTERNAL)
		Make AT a parameter

26-Oct-1984	IFFBDY,LOOPY.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Remove CBCDAT etc. in favour of constants

26-Oct-1984	IFFBDY,SETLAB,SETCON.SRC - Clarke Brunt
		Use expanded number of characters instead of VIOCLR.
		Perform all setting of colour by calling SETCOL, rather
		than explicit GSPLCI. Better to centralise GKS calls,
		and also traps use of silly colours.

26-Oct-1984	IFFBDY,SETLIN,SETCOL.SRC - Clarke Brunt
		Set colour in new routine SETCOL, rather than in SETLIN.
		Change IFFBDY to call SETCOL for all features.
		(FRTLIB never sets the colour these days)

 8-Oct-1984	INTRPL.SRC,EXTRPL.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Use new algorithm for extrapolating points at ends

26-Sep-1984	BLKDAT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		No longer preset CALLUN in /CALCMP/. Pass lun via the
		connection identifier in GKS open workstation.

18-Sep-1984	IFFBDY.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Fix skipping layers if EO pointer invalid or absent

31-Jul-1984	FPP.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Turn off GKS clipping, in the hope that it is faster,
		though what will happen to lines going off the screen
		in GKSLDLIB front ends is likely to be device
		dependent.

18-Jul-1984	GENCIR.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Use better method to determine sense of circle
		Fault points in straight line

29-Jun-1984	various.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Move all GKS parameters to GKSPAR.PAR

29-Jun-1984	OBEY,FPOPWK.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Save up ADV command if workstation not open

28-Jun-1984	FPP.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Move resetting HADFRT etc. to before doing PROSEL,
		so that PROSEL failing does not cause FRT etc. to be
		read all over again.

28-Jun-1984	PROSEL.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Cancel all stored select commands even if error,
		otherwise the erroneous line remains.
		Use SETAUX to aim at the stored commands, rather than
		copying them into TXTBUF.

28-Jun-1984	RDSEL.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Do not stop decoding on comma after a group name. Do
		not check group names against FPP command table. Allow
		CMDLIB errors to be ouput while trying to RDCOMM a group
		name.

27-Mar-1984	IFFBDY.SRC	- DAVE MEADER
		IENDS is now handled correctly.

13-Mar-1984	INTRPL.SRC	- DAVE MEADER

		Initial release of FPP.
