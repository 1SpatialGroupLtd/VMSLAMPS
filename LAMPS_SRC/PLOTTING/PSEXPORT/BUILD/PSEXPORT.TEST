Tests with GERMANY file.
Whole thing too big for PC with 4MB.
Try approx 1/16 of it.
Found grey colours are inverted (0 is black, as in setgray) - fixed.
The grouping of objects by priority appears to work, but will have to
use a smaller file until PC gets more memory.

Adobe Illustrator installed on PC. First trials of output from
PSEXPORT.

Tests with plotfile produced from LITESDEMO using h/w text.

Found will not accept moveto (m) in the middle of path, so amended
to stroke out path when a moveto encountered. Beware solid area
with subpaths - but these not output by default by GKSPSLIB, unless
LSL$PS_FILL_INVIS defined as 1.
Found will not accept E format real numbers (which we output for
numbers less than 0). Could be in original PS file, but in this
case was in text matrix computed in PSEXPORT.
Change in GKSPSLIB and PSEXPORT to use F format for these small
numbers.
