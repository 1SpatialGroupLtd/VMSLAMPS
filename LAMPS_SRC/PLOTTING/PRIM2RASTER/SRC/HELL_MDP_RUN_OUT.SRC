C	Part of the IFF-to-Raster conversion program
C
C	 - takes a run-length and outputs it to mag. tape.
C
C  NB.
C	HELL-MDP can only accept run-lengths in the range 1-255.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments:
C
	INTEGER*4	RUN		! the run-length to output.
	BYTE		VALUE		! and it's colour/density.
C
C Common blocks:
C
***	COMMON/CMN:PRIM2RASTER/
***	COMMON/CMN:RASBUF/
C
C Functions:
C
	INTEGER*4	HELL_MDP_BUFFER	! writes to the tape-buffer.
C
C w/s:
C
	INTEGER*4	I		! DO-loop counter.
	INTEGER*4	REMLONG
	BYTE		REMBYTE
	EQUIVALENCE	(REMBYTE,REMLONG)
C
