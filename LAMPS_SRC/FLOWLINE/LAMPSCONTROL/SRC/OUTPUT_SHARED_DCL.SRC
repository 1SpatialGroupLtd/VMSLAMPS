C Routine to write command file lines shared by all the jacket
C command procedures.
C
C Default values are set for the DCL symbols (if not already 
C defined):
C
C	FLN_INT 		T(rue) if interactive operation
C	FLN_MODE		OPERATE if interactive
C				BATCH otherwise
C
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
	INCLUDE 'LSL$LAMPSCONTROL:FILES.CMN'
	INCLUDE 'LSL$LAMPSCONTROL:LAMPSCONTROLMSG.PAR'
C
C Assume success
C
	OUTPUT_SHARED_DCL = LSC__NORMAL
C
C Command lines to determine if FLN_MODE is defined as string
C
	CALL FLWRTF('$	if f$type(FLN_MODE).eqs."STRING" then -')
	CALL FLWRTF('		goto defined_fln_mode')
C
C Now define FLN_MODE
C
	CALL FLWRTF('$	FLN_MODE == "OPERATE"')
	CALL FLWRTF('$	if f$mode().nes."INTERACTIVE" then - ')
	CALL FLWRTF('		FLN_MODE == "BATCH"')
C
C Command lines to determine if FLN_INT is defined as string
C
	CALL FLWRTF('$!')
	CALL FLWRTF('$ defined_fln_mode:')
	CALL FLWRTF('$	if f$type(FLN_INT).eqs."STRING" then -')
	CALL FLWRTF('		goto defined_fln_int')
C
C Now define FLN_INT
C
	CALL FLWRTF('$	FLN_INT == "t"')
	CALL FLWRTF('$	if f$mode().nes."INTERACTIVE" then -')
	CALL FLWRTF('		FLN_INT == ""')

C Now terminating label

	CALL FLWRTF('$ defined_fln_int:')
C
C Determine command line qualifier symbol /LOG=file-spec for use in any
C activations of LAMPSCONTROL in the jacket command file.
C The purpose is to ensure that any such activations use the same
C log file as the current activation of LAMPSCONTROL.
C
C Determine if current activation has a log file
C
	IF (WANT_LOG) THEN
C
C Write DCL to setup symbol
C
	   CALL FLWRTF('$	fln_log_file_qual = %S',
     &			'"/log=' // LOGFIL(1:LOGFIL_LEN) // '"')
C
C Otherwise, no log file
C
	ELSE
	   CALL FLWRTF('$	fln_log_file_qual = ""')
	ENDIF
