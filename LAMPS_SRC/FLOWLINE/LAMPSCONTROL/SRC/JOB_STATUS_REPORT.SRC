C The following arrays have been transfered to 'LARGE_ARRAYS.CMN', which allows
C the program's storage requirements to be reduced by sharing the larger arrays
C among a number of routines.
C Since these arrays can be used by other routines, care must be taken that 
C their values are not overwritten by any of the routines called by this
C routine.
