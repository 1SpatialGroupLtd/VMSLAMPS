I2GEN takes a binary IFF and converts only the vector and text features into
a GENAMAP 19 ASCII file. Symbol features and attributes are ignored as are
invisible line segments.

I2GEN has now been given a new qualifier, /OFFSET, which will write absolute
coordinates by adding the origin offset held in the Map Descriptor to all
points in the output file. This is done by default (ie if the qualifier is
missing) but may only be disabled by specifying /NOOFFSET.

Linear features will be written to a file called 'filename.GENVECT'. IFF
Feature Codes are translated into GENAMAP descriptions using a parameter
file which is compulsory and specified using /PARAMETER=filename. It should
be of the form:

!
! FC 	GENAMAP Description
!
   1    BUILDING		! Building
  21    ROAD			! Road
   .      .
   .      .
! etc
!
!

All feature codes in the IFF file must have an entry in the parameter file,
even if the features will be ignored.

A corresponding index file called 'INDEX_VECTOR' is created which contains the
filename of the vector file and the eastings and northings of the file.

Another file called 'MENU_VECTOR' is created which has a list of those GENAMAP
descriptions used in the vector file. The descriptions will appear exactly as
in the parameter file.


Text features are written to a file called 'filename.GENTEXT' and require
FC entries in the parameter file. The description associated with this FC is
not used in the output file.

A corresponding index file called 'INDEX_TEXT' is created which contains the
filename of the text file and the eastings and northings of the file.

A typical command line for invoking the program may look like:

$ I2GEN/PARAMETER=HERE:GENCODES.DAT TEST_INFILE TEST_OUTFILE

and would create files:

	TEST_OUTFILE.GENVECT;
	TEST_OUTFILE.GENTEXT;
	INDEX_VECTOR.TEST_OUTFILE;   (if the file contains any vector features)
	INDEX_TEXT.TEST_OUTFILE;     (if the file contains any text features)
	MENU_VECTOR.TEST_OUTTILE;    (if the file contains any vector features)

The image for this program is:

	LSL$SOURCE_ROOT:[CONVERT.I2GEN]I2GEN.EXE

so I2GEN should be defined as:

$ I2GEN=="$LSL$SOURCE_ROOT:[CONVERT.I2GEN]I2GEN.EXE"
