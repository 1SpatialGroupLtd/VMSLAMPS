C	To read across the area data fields, without any processing
C	at present. The area components are read with AREA_ARC and 
C	AREA_VEC. It is assumed that the area components are repeated
C	in the respective ARC and POLY entities.
C	(It is left as an easy exercise for the user to join up the
C	area elements which belong to the area into a total feature)
