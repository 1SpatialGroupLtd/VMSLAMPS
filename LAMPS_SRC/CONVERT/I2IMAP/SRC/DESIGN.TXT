	Converting IFF ACs to Informap attribute annotation points
	----------------------------------------------------------

	after reading parameter files check that ACD entries for
	STARTX,STARTY,ENDX,ENDY were declared and retrieve their ACD types
	set a flag enabling Attribute annotation

	*NOTE* Attribute details are kept in
		ATTR_TAB(ATTR_COD, ITEM)	AC number
		ATTR_TAB(ATTR_TY, ITEM)		Interpretation type
		ATTR_TAB(ATTR_FLD, ITEM)	Value
		ATTR_NAM(ITEM)			NAme (delimited by NULL)

	
	Read IFF entry

	  NF:
	    Reset flags for the attributes STARTX,STARTY,ENDX,ENDY

	  AC:
	    set appropriate flags for STARTX,STARTY,ENDX,ENDY when encountered


	  EF:
	    IF STARTX and STARTY were found
	      IF ENDX and ENDY were not found set them to STARTX,STARTY
	      do a yellow button digitise of these values
	    ENDIF
	  

Attribute annotation is stored in graphic records with the following data:

	control word
	startx,starty,endx,endy
	pointer to the attribute graphic


What is the control word, where do we get the pointer from ?

These details are not important as "features" are digitised in the following 
way:
	Green button to start, followed by white button entries till there are 
	no more coordinates. A yellow button can be marked at the end of the 
	points.

	The routine to do a yellow button mark will be similar to the other 
	buttons

The pointer to the attribute graphic is set at run time when secondary graphics 
are attached. The secondary graphic point only says that this is where the 
graphic will go.

The program needs to recognise these ACs as special and not to output them as 
informap attributes.

When outputting this will be done in the same manner as plotting other 
points (using wtgrel)

only want to digitise a attribute annotation position, but at this stage the 
Attribute record does not have to be defined (this will be done at a later 
stage) as it can change from day-to-day.

Whan the attribute annotation flag is set, the green button bit affects the 
interpretation of DX and DY
	DX(1) and DY(1) always holds the origin of trhe annotation
	when it is set
	  DX(2) and DY(2) hold the orientation information
	otherwise
	  the rientation is assumed to be 0

Simon gave me a copy of a jiffy written a while back for Anglian water in which
features with selected FC had secondary annotation points added to each point on
the feature 

This raises the question of whether we will allow multiple annotation points to
be taken from the IFF file for each feature. Currently working on the assumption
that there will be only one annotation point per feature (Ie the last one will
be used only)


The secondary annotation point effectively creates an invisible line. As IMAP 
files are siomply collection of lines and attributes, this may cause the point 
following the annotation point to be plotted incorrectly. But as this point is 
output at the end of the feature this should not pose a problem.
