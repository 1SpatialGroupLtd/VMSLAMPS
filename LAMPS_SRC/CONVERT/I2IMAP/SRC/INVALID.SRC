C Description
C
C	Opens the invalid features file which contains details about those
C	features which fall wholly or partially outside the map area and
C	writes the standard header information to it. The individual feature 
C	information is added, when found, in module process .
C
C	Returns FALSE if something drastic goes wrong, TRUE otherwise
