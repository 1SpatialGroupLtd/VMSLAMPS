C routine to tidy up after WTGREL (hence TIDY WT !!!)
C
	IMPLICIT NONE

	INCLUDE	'CMN:INFACE.CMN'
	INCLUDE	'CMN:FILES.CMN'
C
	INTEGER*2	IBYT	! byte number of our write position
	INTEGER*2	IBLK	! the block that byte is in
C
C since we were not allowing WTGREL to update the end of file marker,
C in order to speed up our output, we must ensure that the last used
C graphical and non-graphical files have in fact been closed with the
C correct end of file position
C Thus for each file we get the current write position, and then update
C the end of file marker
C
C Note that if KIND is zero (ie we haven't output anything) then we
C needn't bother, and if KIND is 2 (ie annotation) we didn't use
C WTGREL to output the last data, so we needn't bother
C
	IF ( (DATKND.NE.0) .AND. (DATKND.NE.2) ) THEN
	   CALL GPOS(GRALUN,IBYT,IBLK)		! graphical file
	   CALL SEOF(GRALUN,IBYT,IBLK)
	   CALL GPOS(NGRLUN,IBYT,IBLK)		! non-graphical file
