AA2I
====

This appears to have been a work in progress which was terminated and
replaced by another development. Unclear why this was started but it
can be assumed it was easier to extend the existing converter to do
the job than continue.

TDCB: "The simple case I am looking at is CONVERT/AA2I/SRC .. There are two
files in there PUTFTR.SRC (fine) and AA2I.SRC. AA2I.SRC  includes 
'HERE:LOOKUP.CMN', 'HERE:AA2I.CMN' and 'HERE:AA2IMSG.PAR' - none of which
are in that directory implying that the files are missing."

PGH: "AA2I was a bad choice - that was I think an abortive simple version,
that was replaced by the full function of the AA2IFF converter."

TDCB: "So maybe AA2I should simply be deleted? Not sure it has actual
historical value without the context which we can only get by asking you.
(AA2I appears to be a March 1991 invention and AA2IFF appears to be older
and updated April 1991 - presumably to do the job) NB AA2IFF was probably
copied across to form MAPDATA2I as well later"
