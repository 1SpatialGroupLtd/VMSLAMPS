C
C To print an OS code header for a sequence of features with 
c the same code
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
	INTEGER*2	COD
C
C COD is the code to print
C
***	COMMON/CMN:OSCODE/
C
C w/s
	INTEGER		I
	INTEGER*2	CPTR,CHWD(20)
	LOGICAL*1	CHARS(41)		! first byte is length
	EQUIVALENCE 	(CHWD,CHARS(2))		! equivalence string
C
C is it the same as the last printed?
	IF (COD.EQ.LSTCOD) GOTO 999
C
C set this code to be 'last'
	LSTCOD = COD
C
C suppress illegal codes - may not be negative
	IF (LSTCOD.LT.0.OR.LSTCOD.GE.MAXCOD) GOTO 20
C
C pointer into CODESC
	CPTR = LSTCOD*CDSCLN		! FC * length of descriptor
C
C copy code data out
	CURTYP = CODESC(CPTR+1)		! type is the first word
C
C now assemble an ASCII counted string in CHARS
	DO 10 I = 1,CDSCLN-2
	   CHWD(I) = CODESC(CPTR+2+I)	! copy the text over to CHWD
10	CONTINUE
	CHARS(1) = CODESC(CPTR+2)	! length of text as first byte
C
C now print it
	CALL FLWRTF
	CALL FLWRTF('Code%^W%I4 type%I2 - %AC',LSTCOD,CURTYP,CHARS)
C
C ie:	WRITE (2,1000) LSTCOD,CURTYP,(CHARS(I), I=1,CODESC(CPTR+2))
C
C now print format header
	GOTO (1,2,3,4,5),CURTYP
