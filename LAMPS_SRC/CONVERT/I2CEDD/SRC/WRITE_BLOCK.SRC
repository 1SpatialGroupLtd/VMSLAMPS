C Routine to write out data block for I2CEDD program.
C Since we are treating a tape file as if it were an ordinary
C VMS file, the operation will be done using ordinary file write
C routines.
C The block byte buffer to be written is in /DATA_BUFFER/ common block
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C common blocks
	INCLUDE 'HERE:PARAMS.CMN'
	INCLUDE 'HERE:DESCR.CMN'
	INCLUDE 'HERE:DATA_BUFFER.CMN'
	INCLUDE 'HERE:I2CEDDMSG.PAR'

C Assume success
C
	WRITE_BLOCK = I2CEDD__NORMAL
C
C Select the output CEDD file/device
C
	CALL FLWSEL(OUTLUN)
C
C Write out the block
C
	WRITE_BLOCK = FLWLIN(BLOCK_BUFFER,BLOCK_LENGTH,IERR)

C Check for any errors
C
	IF (.NOT.WRITE_BLOCK) THEN
C
C Report primary error
C
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG(WRITE_BLOCK)
C
C Report supplementary error

C Output diagnostics about block, if required
