C Program I2KERNCAM converts data in IFF disc files into 
C KERN's CAM (MAPS200) format, in ASCII code, disc files.
C
C A single IFF file is read and a single ASCII file is created
C for each run of the program.
C
C The IFF file should contain only:-
C	linear features           (GT1,11,12)
C	circumcircle arc features (GT4,5)
C	curved features           (GT6)
C	point features            (GT7,8)
C       text features             (GT10)
C	
C all with feature codes defined in an FRT file defined in the
C command line.
C Other graphical types and features with unknown FC's will be ignored.
C
C AC entries are looked up in the ACD table in the FRT file and output
C as various additional CHANGE TO commands.

C The output file is written in the format described in the various 
C documents describing the Kern Computer-Aided Mapping (CAM) System
C and the MAPS 200 system produced by:
