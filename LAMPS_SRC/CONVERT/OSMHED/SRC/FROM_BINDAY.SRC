C Description
C
C	Converts an ICL binary date into day, month and year, taking 
C	account of a zero date
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments
C
	INTEGER		BINDAY		!  IN - the ICL binary date
	INTEGER		DAY,MONTH,YEAR	! OUT - the date required
C
C Parameters
C
	INCLUDE	'HERE:OSMHEDMSG.PAR'	! error numbers
C
C Functions called
C
	LOGICAL		OSMH_FROM_BINDAY! translates ICL binary date
C
C Local Variables
C
	LOGICAL		GOT_DATE	! got date ?
C
C Assume we get the date
C
	GOT_DATE = .TRUE.
C
C Check for a zero date, which we count as valid
C
	IF (BINDAY .EQ. 0) THEN
 	   DAY  = 0
	   MONTH  = 0
	   YEAR = 0
C
C Translate the binary date if positive
C
	ELSEIF (BINDAY .GT. 0) THEN
	   GOT_DATE = OSMH_FROM_BINDAY(BINDAY,DAY,MONTH,YEAR)
	   IF (GOT_DATE) THEN
C *****	      YEAR=YEAR-1900
	   ELSE
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG( OSMHED__FROMBIN, BINDAY, 1, 73109 )
	      CALL LSL_ADDMSG( GOT_DATE )
	   ENDIF
C
C Negative date, so set flag
C
	ELSE
	   GOT_DATE = .FALSE.
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG( OSMHED__FROMBIN, BINDAY, 1, 73109 )
	ENDIF
C
C If that was unsuccessful, use zero date
C
	IF (.NOT. GOT_DATE) THEN
	   DAY  = 0
	   MONTH  = 0
	   YEAR = 0
 	ENDIF
