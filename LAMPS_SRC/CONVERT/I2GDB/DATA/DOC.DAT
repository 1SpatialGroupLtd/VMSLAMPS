
The I2GDB utility has been modified to prevent lines which are common to two
areas being written twice to the output file.  For this to work correctly, the
following points should be noted:

	o It will only apply to areas (ETYP=FL) intended to be written as
	  lines (ETYP=LI) as opposed to polylines (ETYP=LY). This must be
	  defined in the parameter file.

	o Each point of an area should be given a point attribute. This
	  attribute flags the line (which the point begins - in the direction
	  the area was digitised) as being common to another area. This
	  'shared-code' attribute should be a unique integer or zero. If it is
	  non-zero, it denotes the line as being common to another area (whose
	  corresponding line must have the same unique shared-code attribute on
	  the starting point of the line) and zero denotes that the line does
	  not belong to another area.

	o As areas may be digitised in any order, it is vital that the points
	  have the correct attributes associated with them and if this is not
	  the case, unpredictable results may occur.

	o Duplicate points are not eliminated by this process as only the ENUM
	  of each common LINE is held.

	o Only areas with common lines that are in the same layer will be dealt
	  with.

	o The shared-code attribute should be included in the ACD part of the
	  FRT file and should be of type integer and called 'SHARED' as shown
	  here:

		ACD TABLE 1 
		!	Type	Code	Name	Min	Max
		ACD    	C	1	PKZ
		ACD	I	2	PNR	1
		ACD	R	3	WAN	
		ACD	R	4	WEN	
		!
		! etc
		!
		ACD	I	10	SHARED




















Consider the example below which consists of two areas, A and B, which have
two lines in common. The areas have been shown apart for clarity but do
actually coincide. The first point in each area is denoted by '*' and the arrow
gives the direction in which it was digitised.


100.0           200.0          300.0
  +--------------+ +--------------+  600.0
  |* --->        | |        <--- *|
  |              | |              |
  |              | |              |
  |    Area A    | |              |
  |              | |              |
  |              | |              |
  |              | |              | 
  +--------------+ |              |
  +----------------+              |  500.0
  |                               |
  |                               |
  |                               |
  |             Area B            |
  |                               |
  |                               |
  |                               |
  +-------------------------------+  400.0


The point attributes should be attatched to the points as follows:

For area A, the Coordinate Block entry should look like:

CB FL 0
   GT 12
   NR 5
   NC 3
   NA 0
   HC 91 92 1010		! 'SHARED' attribute has code 1010 in ACD
   DA 100.0 600.0	0	! line is not common
      200.0 600.0	1	! given unique value of 1
      200.0 500.0	2	! given unique value of 2
      100.0 500.0	0	! line is not common
      100.0 600.0	0	! line is not common

For area B, the Coordinate Block entry should look like:

CB FL 0
   GT 12
   NR 7
   NC 3
   NA 0
   HC 91 92 1010		! 'SHARED' attribute has code 1010 in ACD
   DA 300.0 600.0	0	! line is not common
      200.0 600.0	1	! corresponds to value in area A
      200.0 500.0	2	! corresponds to value in area A
      100.0 500.0	0	! line is not common
      100.0 400.0	0	! line is not common
      300.0 400.0	0	! line is not common
      300.0 600.0	0	! line is not common




When we execute I2GDB, with all the above correctly defined, the element
numbers (ENUMs) will be associated with their elements as shown:


  +--------------+ +--------------+
  |3      2     4| |13    11    12|	ENUMs in brackets are those of the two
  |              | |              |	areas (FL). Those adjacent to line are
  |              | |              |	of the lines (LI) and those in corners
  |9     (1)    5| |5             |	are of points (PG).
  |              | |              |
  |              | |              |
  |8      7     6| |              |
  +--------------+ |              |
  +----------------+            19|
  |15     7                       |
  |                               |
  |                 (10)          |
  |14                             |
  |                               |
  |                               |
  |16            17             18|
  +-------------------------------+


NOTE: Lines with ENUMs 5 and 7 will not be duplicated but the end points of the
whole common part will be.
