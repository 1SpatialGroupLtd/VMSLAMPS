C
C A routine to obtain the next record from the MSDS dataset.
C Since this is a tape in VAX COPY format (ie the VAX interpretation
C of the ANSI tape format), this is a fairly easy operation.
C
C The routine returns TRUE if all went well, and FALSE otherwise

C
C read the entity ID and the record type
C - note that a record that only contains spaces is used to fill out
C   a block, so that records don't span blocks. Thus we must ignore
C   any such record that we find.
C
	CALL SETAUX(BUFFER,BUFLEN)
C
	IF (RDLONG(ENTITY_ID)) THEN
	   IF (RDCHS(ICH)) THEN		! it was a blank record
	      GOTO 2000			! ignore it
	   ELSE
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG(MSDS2I__UNEXPEOL,RECNUM,'entity ID')
