C we must ignore 6 fields:
C
C		,Xmin ,Ymin ,Zmax
C		 Xmax ,Ymax ,Zmin
C
C	(what a strange order to specify them in)
C
C now read the integer fields, and ignore them
C
	DO 2000 I = 1,6
	   OK = READ_INTEGER( VALUE, 'bounding cuboid' )
	   IF (.NOT.OK) GOTO 9000
2000	CONTINUE

9000	IGNORE_BOUNDS = OK
	RETURN
	END
