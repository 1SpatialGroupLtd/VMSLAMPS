C *****************************************************************************
C Unfortunately, the datasets that we have available at the moment don't have
C a header record, and the header record isn't defined yet anyway.
C So we just do nothing and return.
C
	IF (DEBUG_LIST) CALL WRITEF('Header not implemented')
C
C NB when we do implement it, modify the code in READ_COUNT.SRC
C
	READ_HEADER = .TRUE.

	RETURN
	END
