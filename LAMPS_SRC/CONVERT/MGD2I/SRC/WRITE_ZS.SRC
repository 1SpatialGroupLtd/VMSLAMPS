C arguments
	REAL	X	! The coordinates

C
C Assume success
C
	WRITE_ZS = MGD2I__NORMAL
C
C Set up point array (assign arguments to it)
C Use assignment rather than equivalence to avoid problems if
C constants are used as arguments in the call to this routine
C
	ZS_POINT(1) = X
	ZS_POINT(2) = Y
	ZS_POINT(3) = Z
C
C Now write the ZS entry to the IFF file
C (point array, number of points, flag as for an ST entry)
C
	CALL IFFZS(ZS_POINT,1,0)

C
C Exit
C
	RETURN
	END
