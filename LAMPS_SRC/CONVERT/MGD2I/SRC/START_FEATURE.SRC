C arguments
	INTEGER		FSN	! feature serial number wanted for ftr
	INTEGER		FCODE	! feature code wanted for ftr
C
C w/s

C
C Assume success
C
	START_FEATURE = MGD2I__NORMAL
C
C Set up ISN to be 0 - to indicate next number should be allocated
C automatically
C
	ISN = 0
C
C Write the NF entry with FSN = argument, ISN = 0 (ie next available)
C
	CALL IFFNF(FSN,ISN)
C
C Set up the FS entry, with FC = argument, all other values in 
C the 4 word array are 0, except for symbol bit
C
	ISTAT(1) = FCODE
	ISTAT(2) = 0
	ISTAT(3) = (64 * 256)	! set bit 14, symbol bit cf IBSET(0,14)
	ISTAT(4) = 0
C
C Write the actual FS entry
C
	CALL IFFFS(ISTAT)
