C Routine to read a data block from a MGD77 tape
C It will check on its first record type identifier and warn
C the user of any deviation from the expected record type "3"
C If the record is of less than 1920 bytes, or an EOF is found instead
C of a data block, then the 'MORE' return argument will be set to
C false to indicate that there is no more data to be read after
C the current block.
C If an EOF is read, the BLOCK_COUNT will also be set to 0 to indicate
C that there is no data in the current block.

C Assume that this is not the last block, and set flag to indicate
C that there are more to come
C

C Read the next block from the tape into the common block buffer
C
	READ_DATA_BLOCK = READ_BLOCK()

C Check for an end of file condition

C Check that the first character in the buffer is "3", indicating

C for a data block
C
	ELSEIF (BLOCK_COUNT.NE.1920) THEN

C If it is not full length, assume that it is the last one on the
C tape and clear the MORE flag to FALSE to indicate there are no
C further blocks to be expected on the tape
