C Works out the drawing ID entry, and outputs it
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Argument
C
	CHARACTER*(*)	FILNAM		! IFF filename
C
C common
C
***	COMMON/HERE:SIF/
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNLSL:FILENAME/
C
C workspace
C
	CHARACTER*(C_NAM_SIZ)	WS_STR	! workspace string
	INTEGER			WS_LEN	! length of string
	LOGICAL			OK	! function return
	CHARACTER*1		CH	! single character
	INTEGER			I	! DO loop variable
	INTEGER			MONTH, DAY, YEAR
	CHARACTER*7		TODAY	! today's date
	REAL			RANGE(4) ! range entry in IFF
	INTEGER*2	IELEN		! length of found IFF entry (-1=eof)
C
C table of standard 3-character representations of month names
C
	CHARACTER*3	MONTHS(12)
	DATA MONTHS/'JAN','FEB','MAR','APR',
     &              'MAY','JUN','JUL','AUG',
     &              'SEP','OCT','NOV','DEC'/
C
C functions
C
	LOGICAL		PUTFLN		! parse filename into /FILENAME/
	LOGICAL		IS_WANTED	! statement function
C
	IS_WANTED(CH) = ( CH.GE.'A' .AND. CH.LE.'Z' ) .OR.
     &			( CH.GE.'0' .AND. CH.LE.'9' )
C
C now, abstract the name part of the filename
C
	OK = PUTFLN( FILNAM )
	IF ( .NOT.OK ) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__PUTFLN, FILNAM )
	   CALL LSL_ADDMSG( OK )
	   GOTO 9999			! no drawing ID produced
	ENDIF
C
C upper case it - we know they're both the same length, so we'll
C upper case all the string, even though some of it may be meaningless
C to us
C
	CALL STR$UPCASE( WS_STR, STR_NAM )
	STR_NAM = WS_STR
C
C search it for any illegal characters
C
	WS_LEN = 0
	DO 100 I = 1, LEN_NAM
	   CH = STR_NAM(I:I)
	   IF ( IS_WANTED(CH) ) THEN
	      WS_LEN = WS_LEN+1
	      WS_STR(WS_LEN:WS_LEN) = CH
	   ENDIF
100	CONTINUE
C
C so we have our name, with all unwanted characters removed
C Is it too long?
C
	IF ( WS_LEN.GT.12 ) WS_LEN = 12		! if so, shorten it
C
C now for the date - output as
C
C		ddMMMyy
C
	CALL IDATE(MONTH, DAY, YEAR)
	CALL EXPAND('%WS%P0%I2%S%I2',TODAY,DAY,MONTHS(MONTH),YEAR)
C
C tell the user
C
	CALL INFORM( MSG__DRNAME, WS_STR(1:WS_LEN), TODAY )
C
C Get the range entry
C
	   CALL IFFRWD				! go back to the start again
	   CALL IFFNXC( 'RA', IELEN )		! find the entry
	   IF (IELEN.EQ.-1) THEN		! if it's not there
	      CALL MOAN(MSG__NOMD)		! complain
	      GOTO 9999				! and give up
	   ENDIF
	   CALL EIHRR( RANGE, 4 , 1 )		! read the entry
	   CALL IFFRWD				! go back to the start again
	   
C
C and we output the standard identifier
C 'Produced by Laser-Scan Laboratories, Cambridge, England'
C (55 characters in all)
C
	CALL SIFDID( WS_STR(1:WS_LEN), TODAY, DIMENSION, RANGE ,
     &	'Produced by Laser-Scan Laboratories, Cambridge, England')
C
C and that is all
C
9999	RETURN
	END
