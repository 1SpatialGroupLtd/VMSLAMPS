C This function converts the coordinate given as argument into
C SIF UORs (units of resolution) using the given offset, and returns it
C
***	COMMON/HERE:SIF/
C
C Arguments are:
C
	CHARACTER*1	XYZ		! name of coordinate
	REAL		COORD		! value to convert
	LOGICAL		HAD_OFF		! offsetting?
	REAL		OFF		! by how much
	REAL*8		SCALE		! scale factor
C
C workspace
C
	LOGICAL		ERROR		! error from CONVERT
C
C functions used
C
	INTEGER*4	CONVERT
C
C convert to UORs by multiplying by SCALE (a real*8 value)
C
	UORALL = CONVERT( COORD, SCALE, OFF, HAD_OFF, ERROR )
C
C were we outside the range?
C if we were, and have had the range, then give the feature it was in,
C otherwise complain about the range
C
	IF ( ERROR ) THEN
	   IF ( HAD_RANGE ) THEN
	      CALL MOAN( MSG__CLIPPED, XYZ, COORD, FSN )
	   ELSE
	      CALL MOAN( MSG__BADRANGE, XYZ, COORD )
