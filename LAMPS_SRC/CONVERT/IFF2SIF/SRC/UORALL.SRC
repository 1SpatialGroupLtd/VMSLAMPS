C Arguments are:
C
	CHARACTER*1	XYZ		! name of coordinate
	REAL		COORD		! value to convert
	LOGICAL		HAD_OFF		! offsetting?

C convert to UORs by multiplying by SCALE (a real*8 value)
C
	UORALL = CONVERT( COORD, SCALE, OFF, HAD_OFF, ERROR )

C were we outside the range?
C if we were, and have had the range, then give the feature it was in,
C otherwise complain about the range
