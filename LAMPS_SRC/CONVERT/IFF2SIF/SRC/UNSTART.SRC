C common file - state variables

C to set things again if they're already at the correct value

C *********************************************************************
C set invalid values for things, so that first time round we'll
C be forced to set up a new value
C
	OLD_LEVEL  = -1
	OLD_STYLE  = -1
	OLD_WEIGHT = -1
	OLD_COLOUR = -1
	OLD_HEIGHT = -1.0

C note that we haven't set a (2d) height yet
C
	HEIGHT_IS_SET = .FALSE.

	RETURN
