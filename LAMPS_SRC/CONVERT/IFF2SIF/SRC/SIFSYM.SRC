C MIRROR	states whether the symbol is to be reflected
C
C		0 => don't reflect
C		1 => reflect in X axis
C		2 => reflect in Y axis
C
C ORI		is the origin of this symbol - where to put it
C
C ANGLE		is the rotation angle of the symbol
C
C XSCALE	x scale factor for symbol
C
C YSCALE	y scale factor for symbol
C
C NAME		is the cell name which states what this symbol is
C
	INTEGER		MIRROR
	INTEGER		DIM
	REAL		ORI(DIM)	! origin
	REAL		ANGLE		
	REAL		XSCALE
	REAL		YSCALE
	CHARACTER*(*)	NAME		! name of symbol
C
C Functions called

	REAL		DEGREE		! convert radians to degrees
	INTEGER		UORX		! change map space into UORs

C now see if we need to add on a mirroring request
C

C and now the origin

C and now the martrix

	   IF (DIM.EQ.3) CALL APPEND('%^L%U%N,',UORZ(ORI(3)))

C
C and finally, the symbol name itself
C
	CALL CHECK_CHAR( NAME )
	CALL SIFOUT
C
	RETURN
