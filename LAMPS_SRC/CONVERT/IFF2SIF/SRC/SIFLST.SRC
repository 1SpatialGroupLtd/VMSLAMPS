C
C This routine is called to output a SIF line string
C
C The type of string to be output is determined by TYPE:
C
C		open string				LST/OP
C		shape or solid (closed line string)	LST/SO
C		hole	       (closed line string)	LST/HO
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments
C
	LOGICAL		PENUP		! invisible line to start?
	CHARACTER*2	TYPE		! line type (NB - writable)
	INTEGER		DIM		! dimension of the data
	INTEGER*2	TPTS		! number of points
	REAL		PTS(DIM,TPTS)	! array of points
C
***	COMMON/HERE:SIF/
***	COMMON/HERE:POINTS/		! for PTS_CNT
C
C workspace
C
	INTEGER		NPTS	! and of TPTS
	CHARACTER*7	STRING	! "LST/xx," string
C
C if it is a hole or a solid, does it have too many points?
C - note that this is a bug, as if it does have too many points,
C   then it should be output as BST/xx LST/OP LST/OP ... EST
C
	IF ( TYPE.NE.'OP' .AND. TPTS.GT.PTSMAX ) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__TOOMANYPTS, PTS, PTSMAX, FSN )
	   NPTS = PTSMAX
	ELSE
	   NPTS = TPTS
	ENDIF
C
C and if it is a simple hole or solid (ie <101 points), is it closed?
C
	IF (TYPE.NE.'OP') THEN
	   IF ( PTS(1,1).NE.PTS(1,NPTS) .OR.
     &		PTS(2,1).NE.PTS(2,NPTS) .OR.
     &	       (DIM.EQ.3 .AND.
     &		PTS(3,1).NE.PTS(3,NPTS)) ) THEN
	      CALL MOAN( MSG__NOTCLOSED, FSN )
	      TYPE = 'OP'			! force line mode
	   ENDIF
	ENDIF
C
C prepare the STRING which we use for starting a new LST
C
	CALL EXPAND('%WSLST/%S,',STRING,TYPE)
C
C now, do we need to start a new string? - only if PENUP
C
	IF ( PENUP ) PTS_CNT = 0	! no points output yet
C
C and we use POINTS to output the data - it outputs sufficient data
C to fill each line, transforming coordinates to UORs as it goes
C
	CALL POINTS( STRING,DIM,NPTS,PTS )
C
	RETURN
	END
