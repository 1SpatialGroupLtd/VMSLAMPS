C Modified 
C  To translate text positions correctly,	I McLeman 31-May-89
C
C This routine outputs a SIF text line characteristics command
C
C	TLC/CO=count,JU=just
C
C The IFF text position code and the SIF code do not refer 
C to the same position i.e.  
C 
C	IFF:	2   5   8	SIF:	1   4   7
C		1   4   7		2   5   8
C		0   3   6		3   6   9
C
C Note also that IFF has a position zero while SIF starts at 1.

C Arguments
C
	INTEGER		COUNT	! number of letters to be output
C
***	COMMON/HERE:SIF/
C
C workspace
C
	INTEGER		LENGTH		! our copy of COUNT
	INTEGER		TJUST		! our copy of JUST
	INTEGER		TRANS_TEXT(0:8)	! Translation table
C
	DATA TRANS_TEXT /3,2,1,6,5,4,9,8,7/
C
C check that the count is legal
C
	IF (COUNT.LT.1 .OR. COUNT.GT.255) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__TLCCOUNT, COUNT, FSN )
	   LENGTH = 1
	ELSE
	   LENGTH = COUNT
	ENDIF
C
C and that the justification makes sense
C
	IF (HAD_JUST) THEN		! just specified by user so no need to
	   TJUST = JUST			! translate.
	ELSE IF (JUST.LT.0 .OR. JUST.GT.8) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__TLCJUST, JUST, FSN )
	   TJUST = 3
	ELSE
	   TJUST = TRANS_TEXT( JUST )
	ENDIF
C
	CALL EXPAND('TLC/CO=%N,JU=%N',LENGTH,TJUST)
	CALL SIFOUT
C
	RETURN
	END
