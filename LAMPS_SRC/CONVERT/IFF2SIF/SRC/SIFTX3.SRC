C Outputs a GENERATE TEXT LINE RANGE command -
C
C	TX3/OR=orix,oriy, AN=angle, TH=height, TW=width
C
C This command generates the range block data for a
C GENERATE TEXT LINE command (see SIFTXT)
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
***	COMMON/HERE:SIF/
C
C Arguments are:
C
	INTEGER		DIM
	REAL		ORI(DIM)
	REAL		ANGLE
	INTEGER		HEIGHT, WIDTH
C
C ORI()		is the origin of the text line in map units
C
C ANGLE		is the angle to rotate the text by, and is given to
C		us in radians, widdershins from X (standard notation)
C
C HEIGHT	is the height of the text in UORS
C WIDTH		is the width  of the text in UORS
C
C functions called
C
	REAL		DEGREE		! convert radians to degrees
	INTEGER		UORX,UORY,UORZ	! convert map units to UORs
	INTEGER		CONVERT		! convert to UORs
	LOGICAL		HADMOAN		! did we complain?
