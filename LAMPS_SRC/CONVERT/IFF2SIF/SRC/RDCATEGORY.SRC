C returns FALSE if it succeeds in reading the category/level details on
C this line, and placing them in /SIFCOM/
C

C
C functions called
C
	LOGICAL		RDLONG		! read a long integer
C
C workspace
C
	INTEGER		CATEGORY,LEVEL
C
C
	RDCATEGORY = .TRUE.		! assume failure
C
C
C we have a category level definition - assume that we are at its start
C
C - so read the category number
C
	IF ( RDLONG(CATEGORY) ) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__BADCATNUM )
	   GOTO 9000
	ELSEIF ( CATEGORY.LT.0 .OR. CATEGORY.GT.MAX_CATEGORY ) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__CATRANGE, CATEGORY, MAX_CATEGORY )
	   GOTO 9000
	ENDIF
C
C and now read the rest of the line...
C - the level that this category should go to
C
	IF ( RDLONG(LEVEL) ) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__BADCATARG, LEVEL, CATEGORY )
	   GOTO 9000
	ELSEIF ( LEVEL.LT.1 .OR. LEVEL.GT.63 ) THEN
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__CATLEVEL, LEVEL, CATEGORY )
	   GOTO 9000
	ELSE
	   CATEGORY_LEVEL(CATEGORY) = LEVEL
	ENDIF
C
	CALL DIAGNOS( MSG__CATLEVIS, CATEGORY, LEVEL )
C
C and finally, we come here at the end of the line
C
	RDCATEGORY = .FALSE.		! success
C
9000	RETURN
C
	END
