C Calculates the FACTOR and ZFACTOR values, for working out UORs
C
C Note that FACTOR and ZFACTOR are REAL*8
C
C UORs are calculated as
C
C	 coord in UORs =  coord in map units *  FACTOR
C	height in UORs = height in map units * ZFACTOR

	IF ( HAD_UORUNIT ) THEN
C
C	 if we have had the UOR unit (in metres) then we can calculate
C	 FACTOR and ZFACTOR
C
C	 if the IFF unit scale is 500 (ie 1:500) then 1 map unit
C	 is 1/500 ground units - ie the map is in 1/500 of the
C	 ground units
C
C	 if 1 UOR is 0.1 metres on the ground, then this is held as
C	 0.1 * 1/500 metres in the IFF file
C
C	 thus in our example, 1 UOR = 1/5000 metres in the IFF file
C
C	 thus we have
C
C		coord in UORs = coord in IFF units * 5000
C
	   FACTOR = IFFSCALE / UORUNIT
C
C	 - if we are scaling in Z, then similar maths can be
C	 applied to our Z coordinates
C	 - alternatively, we might just be multiplying Z by
C	 a constant
C
	   IF ( SCALING_Z ) THEN
	      ZFACTOR = ZSCALE / UORUNIT	! scale as in X,Y
	   ELSEIF ( MULTIPLYING_Z ) THEN
	      ZFACTOR = ZSCALE			! multiply by a constant
	   ELSE
	      ZFACTOR = 1.0			! leave as it is
	   ENDIF
C
C	 so we have defined our scale factors
C
	   HAD_FACTOR = .TRUE.
C
	ELSE
C
C	 otherwise we must complain
C
	   CALL MOAN( MSG__NOFACTOR )
	   FACTOR  = 1.0
	   IF ( MULTIPLYING_Z ) THEN	! UORs not relevant to Z
	      ZFACTOR = ZSCALE		! multiplying by a constant
	   ELSE
	      ZFACTOR = 1.0		! assume not specified yet
	   ENDIF
