C This function converts the argument in radians into degrees
C
C Argument is:
C
	REAL		RADIANS
C
C we need a value for PI
C
	REAL		 PI
	PARAMETER	(PI = 3.141593)
C
C and some workspace
C
	REAL		TEMP
C
C
	TEMP = RADIANS*180.0/PI
C
C ensure that we are within the range 0-360 degrees
C
	IF (ABS(TEMP).GT.360.0) THEN
	   TEMP = MOD(TEMP,360.0)
	ENDIF
C
	IF (TEMP.LT.0) THEN
	   TEMP = 360+TEMP
	ENDIF
C
C so return the result
C
	DEGREE = TEMP
C
	RETURN
	END
