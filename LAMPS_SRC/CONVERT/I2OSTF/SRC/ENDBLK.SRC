C if this is the end of data for the file we are outputting (to tape or
C to disk), then we must write and "end of data" flag
C

C and now pad the rest of the block with "pad" records
C - we keep outputting  "  -6   0" records until we have finished
C the current block - we can tell this because the finished block
C gets output, and BLKPTR gets reset to zero
