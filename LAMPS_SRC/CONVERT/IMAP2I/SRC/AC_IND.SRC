C	CONVERT IMAP2I Utility - Get index in AC list
C
C Description
C
C	Given the AC type, this routine either returns its position in 
C	the list, or, if not already in the list, creates a new slot 
C	for the given AC type and returns that index.

C Included Parameter Files
C
	INCLUDE	'LSL$CMNIFF:CB.STR'	! record structure definition
C
C Arguments
C
	INTEGER*2	THIS_TYPE	! type of AC to find
C
C Common Blocks
C
	INCLUDE	'CMN:TABLES.CMN'	! parameter tables
	INCLUDE	'CMN:IFF_AC.CMN'	! IFF AC data
C
C Local Variables
C
	INTEGER*4	IND		! index into table
	LOGICAL		FOUND_IT	! found the attribute code
C
C Sort ourselves out for a start
C
	IND = 1				! index to start on
	FOUND_IT = .FALSE.		! haven't found anything yet
C
C Now look for the AC type
C
100	IF (FOUND_IT .OR. (IND .GT. NUM_AC)) GOTO 200
C
	FOUND_IT = (ACTYPE(IND) .EQ. THIS_TYPE)
C
	IND = IND + 1
	GOTO 100
C
C If we found it, correct the index
C
200	IF (FOUND_IT) THEN
	   IND = IND - 1
C
C If not, create a new slot if there is room
C
	ELSEIF (IND .LE. MAX_ATTR_NUM) THEN
	   ACTYPE(IND) = THIS_TYPE
	   NUM_AC = IND
C
C Otherwise, set it to null
C
	ELSE
	   IND = -1
	ENDIF
C
C Assign function value
C
	AC_IND = IND

C Return
