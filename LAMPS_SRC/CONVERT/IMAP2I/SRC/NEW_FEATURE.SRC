CMOD    When detecting attr annotation points, only	ST	21-Jun-1994
C       flag a new feature when MSK_NEW is set not

C	of MSK_ANNO. Mod 1371.

C	CONVERT IMAP2I Utility - Check whether to start a new feature
C
C Description
C
C	PREV_MODE and PREV_LTYPE are the mode and linetype for the 
C	segment which has just been output;
C	MODE and LTYPE are the mode and linetype for the segment which 
C	has just been read in, but not yet output
C
C	Note that in RETLIN, 2 points will be output if we are going to 
C	start a new feature.
C
C *****	Note that at present we always start a new feature when the 
C *****	attributes change, but this will not necessarily be the case 
C *****	when we introduce point attributes - then we will only start a 
C *****	new feature if feature attributes (i.e. defined as AC_VAL or 
C *****	AC_TEXT in ATTR_TAB) change.
