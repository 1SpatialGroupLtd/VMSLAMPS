C To write out the coordinates in our array
C
CMOD	write AC with height of feature(ZMAX) if HAD_Z was set	SG 31-jul-1991
C
CMOD	bug fix, The value of IENDS was used but never set, removed duplicate 
C	code							SG 12-sep-1991
C
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments:
	INTEGER		NCOORDS			! number of coordinate pairs
	REAL		COORDS(2,NCOORDS)	! the coordinates
C
C Includes
	INCLUDE		'HERE:ntfdata.cmn'
C
C Workspace:
	INTEGER		POSN			! location in COORDS
	INTEGER		NUM			! how many to write
	INTEGER*2	IENDS			! pen up/down flag
C
	INTEGER*2	LCODE
	REAL		RCODE
	EQUIVALENCE	(LCODE,RCODE)

C write out ACs before writing coordinates
C
	IF (HAD_Z) THEN
	  RCODE = ZMAX
	  CALL IFFAC(3,LCODE)
	ENDIF
C
C----------------------------------------------------------------------------
C Write out the coordinates in blocks no more than 200 points. ensure that there
C is a pen-up to the first block and the remaining blocks have pen down to them
C 
C
	POSN = 1					!start with first point
	IENDS = 0					!pen up
C
	DO WHILE (POSN.LE.NCOORDS)			!while more points
	  NUM = NCOORDS-POSN+1				!num points to write
	  IF (NUM.GT.200) NUM = 200			!only in blocks of 200
	  CALL IFFST(COORDS(1,POSN),NUM,IENDS)		!write
	  POSN = POSN+NUM				!next block of coords
	  IENDS = 1					!pen down
	END DO
