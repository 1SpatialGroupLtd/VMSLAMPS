C Perform the conversion (VALUE isn't changed). The VALUE is compared with the
C min/max X AT THE NTF LEVEL OF ACCURACY. Eg if  XY_MULT is 0.01, and VALUE is
C 3290, then XMIN/XMAX will test against 3290 otherwise they will round to 32
C and hence the RA entry will become 32.0, losing accuracy. Therefore the
C RAnge is XCONVERTed at the end in UPDATE_IFF_FILE.
