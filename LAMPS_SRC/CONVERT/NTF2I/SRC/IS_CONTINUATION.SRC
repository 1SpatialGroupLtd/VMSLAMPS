C
C	This function attempts to solve the problem of NTF format files not 
C	having embedded carriage returns at the end of each line. The lack of 
C	<CR>s causes NTF2I to behave strangely (even crashes at one point).
C
C	Continuation marks are '1's placed at the end of each line. A file in
C	the proper NTF format will have a carriage return after it. currently 
C	ntf2i alway looks at the last but one position in the string for the 
C	continuation mark. it is obvious that if not carriage return is
C	present. the mark will occur at the end of the string. 
C
CMOD	modified to set a global variable which allows other modules to 
C	correctly read a string					SG 
C
CMOD	this works if the last or last but one character is a one, but what 
C	happens if there are extra blanks between the 1 and the end of record
C	in this case go back along the record and see if the last non-space 
C	character is a '1'					SG  12-Aug-1991

C if no sucess then its possible that there may be extra characters between the
C '1' and the EOR (eg ferranti data). in this case work from the end of record 
C backwards, skip over the EOR, and blanks. if the last non space character was 
C a '1' then twas a continuation record.
