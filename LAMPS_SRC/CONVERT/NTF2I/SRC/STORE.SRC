C	function which uses the specified array as a stack, and effectively
C	stores a tuple on it consisting of (RECID,RECORD) This will be used
C	later when NTF2I threads its way through a complicated NTF file
C
CMOD	arrays removed since implementation changed to using indexed files
C	instead, assume file is allready open		SG	12-July-1991

CMOD	set the ID_REC.FSN field to 0. This associates a feature's ID with
