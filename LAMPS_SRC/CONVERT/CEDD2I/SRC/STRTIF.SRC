C so the file is opened safely -
C tell what file we're actually writing to
C
	CALL IFFINQ (ACTNAM, ACTLEN)	! find the file name
        CALL WRITEF
	CALL WRITEF (' Outputting data to IFF file %S',
     &				            ACTNAM (1:ACTLEN))
C
C rewind the file, just for safety's sake
C
	CALL IFFRWD
	INIFF (INLUN) = .TRUE.          ! in an IFF file now
C
999	RETURN				! back to the main program
	END
