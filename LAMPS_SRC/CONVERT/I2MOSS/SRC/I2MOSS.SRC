C I2MOSS takes an IFF file containing 2 or 3d strings and spot heights.
C It formats these into MOSS GENIO (minor option 80) card images. By
C default no MOSS string labels are produced. An option is provided
C to supply MOSS string labels based on the IFF feature codes. This is
C done by reference to a user supplied cross table of IFF FC and MOSS 
C string labels. This is specified using the /CROSS_CODE qualifier.
C /CROSS code takes a file-spec as an argument. This file contains a
C record for each IFF feature code used in the IFF file of the form:
C
C	n	up-to-4-character-label-string 
C	n	up-to-4-character-label-string 
C	n	up-to-4-character-label-string 
C	.       .   .       .       .      .
C	.       .   .       .       .      .
C Where:
C
C	'n' is an IFF feature code 
C          		
C	'up-to-4-character-string' is the desired MOSS label to be used 
C	in the GENIO card images for strings with IFF feature code 'n' 
C	(The label string is treated as left justified).
C
C If an IFF feature code is encountered for which a MOSS label string 
C has not been defined the run will be aborted and the output file
C deleted.
C
C IFF features within layers specified with the /SKIP_LAYER qualifier 
C or having feature codes matching those specified with the /SKIP_FC
C qualifier will not be output to MOSS format. If using the /CROSS_CODE
C option feature code/label records need not be defined for such feature
C codes.
