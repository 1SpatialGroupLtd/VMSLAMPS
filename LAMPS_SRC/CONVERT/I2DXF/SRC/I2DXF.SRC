C Author :  Paul Pan, 5 September 1989
C Modified: Paul Pan, 21 February 1990 to read PARAMETER file
C
CMOD960	    J Barber  23 Jan 1991  To move file opening routines here
C	    and to delete DXF file on error if not had LOG
C		
C Purpose:  reads an input IFF file and generates an output DXF file 
C
        IMPLICIT NONE

C Common Blocks:

	INCLUDE	 'LSL$CMNDXFPAR:LOOKUP.CMN'
	INCLUDE  'HERE:I2DXF.CMN'		! added on 28/02/90

	INCLUDE	 'HERE:LAYER.CMN'

C Functions:
	INTEGER*4	IFFOPEN

C
	LOGICAL		FRTINI
	LOGICAL     	GETCMD		! Gets data from command line
	LOGICAL     	RDPAR		! Reads data from PARAMETER file
	LOGICAL     	READ_FRT	! Reads FRT file
	LOGICAL     	READ_IFF

C Workspace:
C
	LOGICAL     OK			! Flag for functions working
        INTEGER     TEMP_COUNTER
C
C----------------------------------------------------------------
C Initialise:
C
	CALL LSL_INIT
C
C Read the commands		
C
        OK = GETCMD()
C
	IF (.NOT.OK) THEN 
           CALL LSL_PUTMSG(I2DXF__BADCMD)
           GOTO 999
        ENDIF
C
C open IFF file, and if we can't do that, then give up
C
        OK = IFFOPEN( IFFLUN,IFFFIL(1:IFFLEN),,HAD_LOG )
C
        IF (.NOT.OK) GOTO 999
C
C----------------------------------------------------------------
C open DXF file, and if we can't do that, then give up
C
	OK = FLWOPN( DXFLUN,DXFFIL(1:DXFLEN) )
C
	IF (.NOT.OK) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG(I2DXF__UNABOPDXF)
	   GOTO 9000
	ENDIF
C
C report the output file
C
	IF (HAD_LOG) CALL LSL_PUTMSG(I2DXF__OPENDXF,DXFFIL(1:DXFLEN))
C
C then select the DXF file for output
C
        CALL FLWSEL( DXFLUN )
C
C----------------------------------------------------------------
C now initialize the FRT file
C
        OK = FRTINI( FRTFIL(:FRTLEN) )
C
	IF (OK) THEN
           CALL LSL_PUTMSG(I2DXF__BADFRT)
	   OK = I2DXF__BADFRT
           GOTO 9001
        ENDIF
C
        IF ( HAD_LOG ) CALL LSL_PUTMSG(I2DXF__OPENFRT,FRTFIL(1:FRTLEN))
C
C----------------------------------------------------------------
C Read PARAMETER file
C
        OK = RDPAR()		
	IF (.NOT.OK) GOTO 9001
C
C Read FRT file
C
        OK = READ_FRT()		
	IF (.NOT.OK) GOTO 9001
C
C Set default counter
C
        TEMP_COUNTER = 0
C
C file manipulation 
C please note that the IFF file has already been opened 
C
        OK = READ_IFF()
C
C close DXF file, deleting if had an error unless LOG selected
C
9001    IF (.NOT.OK .AND. .NOT.HAD_LOG) THEN
	   CALL FLWDEL(DXFLUN)
	ELSE
	   CALL FLWCLO(DXFLUN)
	ENDIF
C
9000	CALL IFFCLO(IFFLUN)
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------
C And finally exit with the error/success status
C
999	IF (OK) OK = I2DXF__NORMAL
	CALL LSL_EXIT(OK)
C
	STOP
	END
