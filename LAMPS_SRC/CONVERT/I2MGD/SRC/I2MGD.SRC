C Program I2MGD converts data in IFF disc files into MGD77 format files
C on mag tape.
C
C A single IFF file is read for each run of the program and may be written
C to the beginning of the tape or appended to existing datasets.
C
C The IFF file should contain only point features of a certain feature code
C with a ZS entry containing the longitude, latitude, and geophysical variable
C (any other feature types or codes found in the IFF file are not converted
C and a warning message is issued). All the information to be put in the
C "header record" is taken from the AC entries of the point feature in layer 0,
C and the information associated with each "data record" is taken from the
C AC entries of the point features in subsequent layers.
C
C Programs MGD2I and I2MGD use a FRT file (MGD77_ACD_TABLE.FRT) containing
C an ACD table defining all the AC entries used to hold the information
C contained in the "header record" and the "data records" of the MGD77 format.
