                ---------------------------------------------------------------

		which are output with /NOINFO_TABLES.

                ---------------------------------------------------------------
DOTABLES      - Routine now saves a cpoy of the number of bytes used in the
		AAT and PAT tables in external variables for use by I2ARC.
	      - Routine outputs the field width in a fixed width of 16
		characters.
I2ARC	      - Routine now outputs the total number of bytes used to the AAT
		and PAT tables as set by DOTABLES.
GETATTINFO    - Function now sets the initial field width of attribute names
		to be 16 before determining the true lentgth. This prevents
		a long attribute name being truncated to be the same length
		as a previous attribute.

21/04/93	I2ARC.C		- Steve Townrow (Mod 1224)
                ---------------------------------------------------------------
I2ARC	      - In function st_out, the user and internal ID numbers are
		written so that they are the same as the feature in the ARC
		section to which they belong. The variable output was 'id' and
		is now 'narcs'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Prior to this, I2ARC never had an update file as entries were
		entered into the modules themselves.
