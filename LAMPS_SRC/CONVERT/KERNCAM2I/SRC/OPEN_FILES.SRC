C So the file is opened safely -
C tell what file we're actually writing to
C

        CALL WRITEF
	CALL WRITEF (' Writing to IFF file %S',

C
C Rewind the file, just for safety's sake
C
	CALL IFFRWD
	INIFF = .TRUE.                  ! in an IFF file now
C
        CALL IFFRLA                     ! look ahead optimisation
C
999	RETURN				! back to the main program
