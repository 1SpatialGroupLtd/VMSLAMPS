C Coded November 1984
C
C To select a previous dynamic table, by restoring the contents of
C   /TABLE_DEFINITION/ which were earlier saved by use of SAVTAB
C
C argument:
	INTEGER*4	ALL_THAT_LOT(12)	! contains:
C
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(1) - TABLE - location of command table
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(2) - TSIZE - ... its size
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(3) - BYTAB - location of name buffer
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(4) - BSIZE - ... its size
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(5) - ARGARR - location of argument specifier array
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(6) - ARGSIZ - ... its, and UFLARR's, size
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(7) - UFLARR - location of user flags array
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(8) - TABHDR - table header
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(9) - TABOFF - offset of table indices (allows for
C				presence of user flags array, which
C				displaces rest of command table)
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(10) - TABCNT - table fill index
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(11) - BYTCNT - name buffer fill index
C in ALL_THAT_LOT(12) - MAXCMD - maximum command number so far
