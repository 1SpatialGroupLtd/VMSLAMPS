C to output a dummy plot - this is the termination signal for a
C Xynetics plotter. We output it explicitly as byte values, so that we
C can ensure that the correct (ie the same as OS already produce
C themselves!) dummy plot is produced.

C now we have a data statement to assemble the dummy plot for us

	DATA DUMMY/	3 * '00'O,
     &			'00'O, '23'O,		! start of block
     &			'00'O, '21'O,		! reset origin
     &			'00'O, '11'O,		! message to console
     &			'00'O, '14'O,		! '14' chars (octal)

C unset FSTUNT, just in case, since we don't want OUTREC calling
C at any level, to start a new block for us !!
C
	FSTUNT = .FALSE.
C
C now we are going to transfer this data to the buffer for output...
C
	OUTLEN = 38
	DO 10 I = 1,OUTLEN
	   OUTBUF( I ) = DUMMY( I )
10	CONTINUE
C
C and that is all we need to do in here

	RETURN
	END
