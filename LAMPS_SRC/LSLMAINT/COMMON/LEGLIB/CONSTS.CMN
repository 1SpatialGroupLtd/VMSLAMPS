C Block to hold odd constant arguments for subroutines
C
	INTEGER ZERO,ONE,MINUS1,TWO
	REAL FLZERO
	LOGICAL*1 TRUE,FALSE
C
	COMMON/CONSTS/FLZERO,ONE,MINUS1,TWO
C
C overlap as much as possible, to get maximum advantage
	EQUIVALENCE (FLZERO,ZERO,FALSE)
	EQUIVALENCE (MINUS1,TRUE)
C
C ZERO holds 0
C ONE holds 1
C MINUS1 holds -1
C TWO holds 2
C
C FLZERO holds 0.0
C
C TRUE holds .TRUE.
