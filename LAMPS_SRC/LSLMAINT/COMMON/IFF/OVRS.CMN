C OVRS is an array of overlay numbers, grouped according to file. More
C	specifically, for each file there is a list of overlay numbers
C	to be used, terminated by -1 (0 is legal layer number).
C
C NOVR is used as a general index into this array, & holds the
C	index of the last filled cell within OVRS.
C
C OUTOVR holds an (optional) index for the output file - this would
C	generally be 1. Thus the output file may have layers specified.
C
C INOVR is an array of such indices - each entry is for one input file
C	and points to the start of a group of layer numbers in OVRS.
