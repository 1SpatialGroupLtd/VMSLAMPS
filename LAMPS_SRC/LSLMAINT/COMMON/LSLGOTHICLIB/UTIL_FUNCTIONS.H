Status check macros changed to wrappers for new SCHLIB * check macros. * * Added a function: util_copy_buffer(num_bytes, source, *dest) which creates * and returns a dynamic copy of a data buffer if the source buffer address is * non-NULL and the number of bytes to copy is positive. It returns NULL * otherwise. * * Added a function: util_replace_buffer(num_bytes, source, *dest) which destroys * (frees up) the data buffer defined by <<*dest>> on input (if non-NULL), then * creates and returns a dynamic copy of the contents of <<source>> via <<*dest>> * if the source data buffer address is non-NULL and the number of bytes to copy * is positive. * * Added a function util_strcat, that is like strcat but does a realoc when needed. * * Moved all the exported function declarations into <<util_intrinsics.h>>.
