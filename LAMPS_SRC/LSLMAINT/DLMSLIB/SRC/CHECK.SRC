C routine to add ADDON into our accumulated checksum
C we are working with pairs of 18bit 1/2 words (our way of holding
C Univac 36 bit words)
C
C We do integer addition (! in 1s complement !) of the two numbers.
C Any overflow causes the overflown bit to be added in at the bottom
C again.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C we were passed
C
	INTEGER*4	ADDON(2)	! our next increment
	INTEGER*4	CHKSUM(2)	! accumulate in this
C
C workspace
C
	INTEGER*4	CARRY		! for holding overflow
C
C add the two low 1/2 words...
C
	CHKSUM(1) = CHKSUM(1) + ADDON(1)
C
C and add the two high 1/2 words...
C
	CHKSUM(2) = CHKSUM(2) + ADDON(2)
C
C do we need to carry from low to high?
C
	IF ( CHKSUM(1).GT.'3FFFF'X ) THEN
	   CHKSUM(1) = CHKSUM(1).AND.'3FFFF'X
	   CHKSUM(2) = CHKSUM(2) + 1
	ENDIF
C
C do we have an overflow in the top 1/2 ?
C
	IF ( CHKSUM(2).GT.'3FFFF'X ) THEN
	   CHKSUM(2) = CHKSUM(2).AND.'3FFFF'X
	   CHKSUM(1) = CHKSUM(1) + 1
	ENDIF
C
C and does that cause us to overflow at the bottom?
C
	IF ( CHKSUM(1).GT.'3FFFF'X ) THEN
	   CHKSUM(1) = CHKSUM(1).AND.'3FFFF'X
	   CHKSUM(2) = CHKSUM(2) + 1
	ENDIF
C
C and that is our checksum updated...
C
	RETURN
	END
