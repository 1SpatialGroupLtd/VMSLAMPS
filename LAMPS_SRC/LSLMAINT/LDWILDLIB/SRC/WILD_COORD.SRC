C
C LDLIB lookalike for WILD plotter
C
C to convert Wild plotter coordinates to "real" coordinates
C
C the WILD coordinates are in character form (+ an offset) in
C bytes 3-10 of BUFFER

C
C subtract "@" or ('40'H) from the bytes (perhaps this should be 
C BUFFER(2))
C

C
C build up the integer coordinates
C
	IX = IBUF(1)*P1 + IBUF(2)*P2 + IBUF(3)*P3 + IBUF(4)
	IY = IBUF(5)*P1 + IBUF(6)*P2 + IBUF(7)*P3 + IBUF(8)
C
C pass them back if they are valid
C
	IF (IX.GE.MIN_XCOUNT.AND.IX.LE.MAX_XCOUNT.AND.
     &	    IY.GE.MIN_YCOUNT.AND.IY.LE.MAX_YCOUNT) THEN
	   X = IX
