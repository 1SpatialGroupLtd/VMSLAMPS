C To insert VALUE into bits START to END (in OS/ICL bit order) of TO
C
C NOTE that the relevant ICL machines number their bits with bit 0
C      as most significant, in a 24 bit word - ie the relationship
C      between ICL and VAX bits is:
C
C  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
C 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

C Arguments
C
	INTEGER		TO		! longword to insert into
	INTEGER		START		! ICL start bit
	INTEGER		END		! ICL end bit
	INTEGER		VALUE		! the value to insert
C
C Workspace
C
	INTEGER		BOT,TOP		! VAX start and end bits
C
C *****************************************************************************
C Calculate the VAX start and end bits from the ICL values
C
	TOP = 23 - START
	BOT = 23 - END
C
C and insert the relevant bit field
C
	CALL LIB$INSV( VALUE, BOT, TOP-BOT+1, TO )
C
	RETURN
	END
