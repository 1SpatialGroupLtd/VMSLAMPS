C Takes an array of ICL characters in INPUT, and outputs them as ASCII
C characters in OUTPUT. There are 4 6bit ICL characters in the bottom
C 24 bits of each 32bit VAX longword in INPUT, which is thus an array
C of length (NCHS+1)/4 longwords. OUTPUT is an array of NCHS bytes.

C Arguments
C
	INTEGER		NCHS		! the number of characters
	BYTE		OUTPUT(NCHS)	! the ASCII byte array
	INTEGER		INPUT(*)	! the packed input array
C
C Functions
C
	INTEGER		LIB$EXTZV	! extract a bit field

C Workspace
C
	INTEGER		I		! DO loop variable
	INTEGER		CH		! current character
	INTEGER		POS		! its position
	INTEGER		WORD		! the longword index
C
C The ICL 6bit and ASCII 7bit characters sets differ as follows:
C The ICL character set is in the sequence
C
C	"0123456789:;<=>?"
C	" !"#$%&'()*+,-./"			where "$" is a pound sign
C	"@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[$]^_"	starting at hex 0 (oct 0)
C
C (note that in later versions, the pound sign is replaced by a dollar,
C  and the dollar by a "\", as in ASCII)
C
C whilst the equivalent span of ASCII goes
C
C	" !"#$%&'()*+,-./"			where "$" IS a dollar sign
C	"0123456789:;<=>?"
C	"@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_"	starting at hex 20 (oct 40)
C					      & note the "\" instead of "$"
