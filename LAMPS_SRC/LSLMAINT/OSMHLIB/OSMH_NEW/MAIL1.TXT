Your recent release of IMP and CONVERT packages, containing the SPR fixes and
mods for OS, only contained release notes, so Customer Services had no idea what
to do with them. The following were missing (from each package):

	SPR's with final responses filled in
	copies of mod forms (for signing off)
	new documentation (i.e. the chapters which were changed)

There was no mention in the CONVERT release notes of an amended DATA PREPARATION
section in the IFFOSTF chapter (i.e. new OSMHLIB error messages), and the new
chapter itself was missing.

I believe there should be some additional changes to the IMP and CONVERT
documentation, e.g. amendment/deletion of the warnings about no flags being 
present in the type 3 headers, but you need to read through it to check.

There was no folder for LSLMAINT (for the OSMHLIB release), and no update of the
OSMHLIB Technical Reference Manual (i.e. new error messages).

Have the standard files been updated ?
