C To remove a command from a previously-defined command table
C No errors are returned - all commands with the given CMD_NUMBER
C are removed from the table - if there aren't any, that's your fault.

C Argument:
	INTEGER*4	CMD_NUMBER	! command number to be removed
C
C workspace:
	INTEGER*4	C,D,NAMLEN

C
C search for command number in table
	MAX_CMD_NUMBER = 0
	D = 0
C
	DO 20 C=1,TABLE_COUNT
C
C make a pass through table of descriptors, updating pointers to
C characters we have moved, and removing the descriptor we have found
	   CALL LSL_COPY_TABLE_LONGS(
     &			    %VAL(TABLE_ADDRESS+C*8+TABLE_OFF),
     &			    NAME_DESC,
     &			    2)
C
C does the command number match the one we want?
	   IF (NAME_DESC1(2).NE.CMD_NUMBER) THEN
C
C re-calculate maximum command number in table
	      IF (NAME_DESC1(2).GT.MAX_CMD_NUMBER)
