C To define a 'window' on the input command line
C
C arguments:
	INTEGER*2	START		! (optional) position in buffer
C					!  to set DCPTR to (ommitted=>
C					!	  use current position)
	INTEGER*2	LENGTH		! (optional) length of window
C					!  to set up (ommitted=>
C					!	  reset whole line)
C
C function called:
	LOGICAL		HAVE_I_AN_ARG	! have I an arg?

C
C how about the position?
	IF (HAVE_I_AN_ARG(1)) DCPTR = START
C
C allow for length
	IF (HAVE_I_AN_ARG(2)) THEN	! set window

C indicate we have set a window
