C we were passed
C
	INTEGER*2	BUFPTR
	INTEGER*2	BUFMAX
	BYTE		BUFFER(BUFMAX)
C
C and also need
C
	INTEGER		I		! do loop
	INTEGER		LIMIT		! limit for loop
C
C so copy things - only restore up to BUFMAX characters
C
	IF ( BUFPTR.GT.0 ) THEN
	   LIMIT = MIN( BUFPTR,BUFMAX )
	   DO 10 I = 1,LIMIT
	      EXPBUF( I ) = BUFFER( I )
10	   CONTINUE
