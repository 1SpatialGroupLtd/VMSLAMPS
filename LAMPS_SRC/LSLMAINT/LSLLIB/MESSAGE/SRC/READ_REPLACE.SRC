C This routine reads the text for a replace command
C It returns TRUE if it fails, and FALSE otherwise
C
	IMPLICIT NONE

C assume that we fail
C
	READ_REPLACE = .TRUE.
C
C we just read the line, and assume, for the moment, that it is OK
C
	LENGTH = READSTR( TEXT, 0, ON_EOL, .TRUE., OK )
	IF (.NOT.OK ) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG(NEWMSG__READREP,LINE_COUNT)
	   CALL LSL_ADDMSG(OK)
	   GOTO 9000
	ENDIF
C
C if we are doing a RUNOFF file, we must output the line to the index file
C
C	<severity> <type> <count> <ident> <text>
C
	IF ( OUT_RUNOFF ) THEN
	   CALL FLWSEL( SEQ_UNIT )
	   CALL FLWRTF( INDEX_FORMAT, SCODE(MESS_COUNT), 'R', 0,
     &				      IDENT(MESS_COUNT), TEXT(:LENGTH) )
	ENDIF
C
C so we have succeeded
C
	READ_REPLACE = .FALSE.
