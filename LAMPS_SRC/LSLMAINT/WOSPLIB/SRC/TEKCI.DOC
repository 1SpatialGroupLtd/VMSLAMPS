USING TEKCI
============

Assign the TMU line to LSL$TK (VAX) or TK0 (PDP)
RUN TEKCI and G to DEBUG or TITS as appropriate
In response to the prompt  TCOM>  type either the abbreviated form
of the command as shown below (or the full command on the VAX). 
In either case the arguments are as shown in the documentation.
N.B. They are not in brackets as in a Fortran call.

MB X Y		=> MOVBY(X,Y)
MT X Y 		=> MOVTO(X,Y)
LB X Y 		=> LINBY(X,Y)
LT X Y 		=> LINTO(X,Y)
CM		=> LDCMPL
CH N		=> CHAIN(N)
DA N D D1 D2	=> DASHED(N,D,D1,D2)
DO N		=> DOTTED(N)
S A X		=> SCRUB(A,X)
O X Y		=> ORIGIN(X,Y)
U F		=> UNITS(F)
I SW LUN EFN	=> LDINIT(SW,LUN,EFN)
W		=> LDWAIT
BL PATTERN	=> RFBLNK(PATTERN)
BE		=> RFBEND
RF		=> REFRSH
RS		=> RFSTOP
DD N		=> DISMOD(N)
MC		=> MOVTOC
LC 		=> LINTOC
E L T		=> TKIDEV(LINE,TABLET)
T L B		=> TKTRAC(LINE,BUTTON)
M L X Y S C SC	=> TKMAPT(LINE,MATRIX) last 5 values form the matrix
TW X1 X2 Y1 Y2	=> TKTWIN(X1,X2,Y1,Y2)
CU		=> CURSOR
PI(ng)		=> ring Tek bell
CW X Y		=> CSWT(X,Y)
CR		=> CSRD (X and Y are displayed on the screen)
CA "string"	=> CHARS('STRING') (the string should be enclosed in "s)
PC char		=> PRTCHR(CHAR) (the actual char may be typed)
CF NFONT NITAL	=> CHFONT(NFONT,NITAL)
CS CH CX CY	=> CHSIZE(CH,CX,CY)
TS N		=> TKCHSZ(N)
R		=> TKRASP (emit TMU noise)
CL N		=> CURSEL(N)
DR M C		=> DREPT(MINMAJ,COUNT)
SU M P L	=> DSUBST(MINMAJ,PTR,LEN)
OF X Y		=> TKOFF(X,Y)

CT		=> CHTEST (character test subroutine)
SP		=> CSPEED (character speed test subroutine)
P		=> PICL (test Subroutine - draws 3-D L)

CV N M L	=> C(N,M,L) PDP only - draw 'C' or 'Dragon' curve

Q		=> Quit TEKCI

Command for very basic testing of input facilities:
TR N		=> TKREAD(N,...) event flag N+11
TK N		=> TKKILL(N)
WE N		=> WAITFR(N+11) wait for event flag N+11
BU N		=> Type Length, IO status block, AST call flag, and
		   BUFFER for channel N
The TR command clears the buffer and IOSB, and sets the length and AST
call flag to 0 for channel N.
It is necessary to use the WE (wait for event flag) command to
prevent TEKCI grabbing all input.
The TKREAD issued specifies an AST routine which merely sets the
AST call flag to 1, thus the sequence:
TR 1
WE 1
some terminal input
BU 1
will read a line of input from the terminal and then display it.

Commands TKREAD, TKKILL, TKIDEV, TKTRAC, TKMAPT all type the
return code from the routine (1 for success).
