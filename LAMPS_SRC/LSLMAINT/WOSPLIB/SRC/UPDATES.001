* => TEKLIB V1 altered
+ => TEKLIB V1 needs to be altered
! => change doesn't apply to TEKLIB V1

 9-Dec-1984	Clarke Brunt
	  TKVG02,TKVW02 Output a CR on the end of all records output
			(Doesn't solve problem of missing LFs anyway!)

 6-Dec-1984	Clarke Brunt
	  TKNL02	Remove DIFRAM,PCFRAM
	  TKOD02	DIFRAM,PCFRAM synonyms for TKCLR

26-Nov-1984	Clarke Brunt
	  LSCH02,TKRF02 Change bits transmitted for 14 bit LCD

15-Oct-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  LSCH02	Transmit bits 2-13 for 14 bit LCD. Now produces
			two modules - LSCH and LSCH14

15-Oct-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKIP02	Output esc=X as part of timeout message rather
			than using standard output mechanism (could be
			in $FLUSH when AST delivered!).
			Use hard copy event flag for message QIO
	  TKOD02	Set hard copy waiting flag BEFORE setting timer.
			ASTADR, not AST in $SETIMR - was never actually
			executing AST at all
	  TKVG02	More rigorous test for hard copy timer in view
			of use of event flag in TKIP
	  TKRF02	Test for completion of cursor TKREAD before
			setting timer

 3-Oct-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKIP02,TKOD02,TKIW02	Use LIB$GET_EF for all four event flags
			including one for input, which previously used 0
			Free them all, and deassign channel on TKINIT(0)

	
31-Aug-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKIP02,TKOD02,TKIW02	Dispense with mailbox altogether.
			Leave a read outstanding. If timeout with
			nothing read, then just reissue.
			(DMF32 seems to lose first unsolicited chars)
 
 2-Aug-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKIP02	In RDAST, issue repeated reads until typeahead
			buffer is empty. Fixes problem of several lines
			getting buffered up sometimes observed in LITES.

16-Jul-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  LSCH02	Allow fonts 0-7 rather than just 0-1

 4-Jun-1984	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKOD02	Use symbols rather than constants for the screen
			extents returned by LDFPPM. Common TKWS was
			initialised differently in various modules.

13-Dec-1983	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKWS02, TKOD02 It has proved a bad idea to only set the screen
			extents in TKINIT, since programs call LDFPPM
			without doing TKINIT. Therefore set TKEXT as
			constants in TKWS and don't bother to calculate
			them in TKOD.

 9-Dec-1983	Clarke Brunt
!	  LSCH02	Use esc=M instead of esc=0 for character font

 5-Dec-1983	Clarke Brunt
	  TKBS02	Optimise TKTRMT with some MULF3's

 1-Dec-1983	Clarke Brunt
	  Changes arising from LITES optimisation
!	  TDDC02	Now just RSB instead of popping a return address
			and doing RSB. JMP back to TKBS where previously
			did ordinary RSB. (See TKBS changes)
!	  TKBS02	Change several JSB,RSB sequences to JMP
			LR1EST code now inline at LTGEN
			JSB to T.DDC
			'Thick' diversion tidied
			Do a $CHKBF 0 after $TKWCH in CHGEN
!	  TKIP02	Use $ESCSQ3 of X
!	  TKOD02	Do $CHKBF in TKSTYL and TKCHSZ
			Use $ESCSQ3 in SETALT and OFF
!	  TKRF02	$CHKBF 7 (not 4) for blinked start
			Do not bother to $CHKBF in CSRD
			Conditionalise $CHKBF in CSWT for LCD14
!	  TKVG02	ESTAB now inline in TKMVGN, loop optimised
			TRNSMT now outputs directly to buffer rather
			than using TKWCH
			Commented out FLSHNG in $CHKBF, do not add
			10 to required length, but rely on TKBLIM being
			set some bytes before end of buffer.
			Improve test for ALT.ESC= in $TKWCH, and
			no longer do a $CHKBF
			Commented out checking of FLSHNG in $FLUSH (not
			needed if $TKWCH does not $CHKBF)
!	  TKVW02	Set TKBLIM to end of buffer minus 14
			
16-Nov-1983	Clarke Brunt
!	  TKOD02	Call LIB$STOP on failure to translate LSL$TK
			Call LIB$SIGNAL on failure of system service
			calls. Set QO.CHAN before enabling mailbox
			and intialising WOSP (just in case!).

15-Nov-1983	Clarke Brunt
	  Changes to pattern generation

!	  DSUBST	Converted to MACRO - optional 4th argument to specify
			substitution routine (default SUBSTT)
!	  TKDDCP .MAR,.SRC	Added SUBRTN, changed order of block
!	  TDDC02	Do not bother clearing DSUBTP, DSUBTL
			Add TKSBST which calls user's substitution
			routine (default SUBSTT)
!	  TKDDCG	Call TKSBST instead of SUBSTT
!	  WOSPLIB.COM	Macro DSUBST instead of Fortran
			Remove TEKCI stuff

14-Nov-1983	Clarke Brunt
	  Updates arising from production of PDP WOSPLIB

!	  TKHD02	Removed TKIBSZ (unused)
			Added AS.NBI (bias value) and AS.ESE (escape-escape)
!	  TKIP02	Use AS.NBI instead of ' '
			Move TKRASP to TKOD02
			Added utility GETLIN rather than duplicating code
			several times.
!	  TKOD02	Set TKOSEL and TKBPTR when initialising
			Calculate TKEXT (screen extents)
			Insert TKRASP (from TKIP02)
			Convert several BSBW to JSB (external ones!)
			# sign before WAITMUL in TKCTIM
!	  TKRF02	Remove spurious TSTB SEGTYP in GENSEG
			Do a GENSEG 0 in RPRCH so that if first thing in
			refresh is characters, they actually come out
			Remove spurious BRB 2$
			Set TUPTD bit in FLAGW in DSTORE (DISMOD 0) to ensure
			move back to line drawing position
			Change $CHKBF 4 to 3 in CSRD and rearrange some code
			Remove commented out code
!	  TKRW02	Remove unused cursor stuff
!	  TKVG02	Don't check for 0,0 move in TKMVGN if TRANSPAR
			bit in FLAGW is set. (What appears to be a
			0,0 move isn't if have just changed between
			tracked/untracked segment)
			Use AS.NBI and AS.ESE instead of ' ' and 'O'
!	  TKVW02	Do not declare TKBUF1 twice (I don't think
			it can overflow)
!	  TKWS02	Do not preset TKSCF, BASETR, TKEXT
			Remove unused TKLSTD

12-Jul-1983	Susan Manning
!	  TKOD02	Don't declare exit handler for LCD14 version
			of the library

03-Jun-1983	Susan Manning
!	  TKVG02	Add table TRANTB determining bytes to be 
			transmitted when any particular byte changes,
			alter ESTAB to use TRANTB

!	  TKOD02	Centre of screen calculated from screen size and
	  TKVW02	stored at initialisation

9-Nov-1982	Tony J Ibbs
?	  TKRF02	In cursor routine, use CSEFN as timer request ID, rather
			than using an explicit #1, which clashed with things.

9-Nov-1982	Susan Manning
!         TKBS02	Ensure all coordinates are flushed out after drawing
			characters

2-Nov-82	Robin Fairbairns
