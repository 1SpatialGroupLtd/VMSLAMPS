C
C	Sets up the line LSL$CONSOLE to deliver an AST to the given
C	routine when a valid function button byte appears in it.
C	If the USERAST is zero, AST's are then disabled. 
C
C	The routine is called as AST(BUTTON) where BUTTON is the 
C	decoded number read from the serial line.
C
C
C	Returns:	SS$_NORMAL if OK
C			or something else if something wrong
