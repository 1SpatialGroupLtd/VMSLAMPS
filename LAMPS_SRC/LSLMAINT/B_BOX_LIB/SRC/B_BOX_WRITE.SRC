C
C argument
	INTEGER		PATTERN			! light pattern
C
C definitions
	INCLUDE		'($IODEF)'		! I/O function codes.
	INCLUDE		'($SSDEF)'		! return codes
C
C common blocks:
	INCLUDE		'B_BOX_COMMON.CMN'
C
C functions called:
	INTEGER*4	SYS$QIOW
C
C w/s:
	INTEGER		STATUS				! system returns.
	INTEGER		IOSTAT(2)			! IOSB
	INTEGER		IPAT
	INTEGER		I, J
C
C split the pattern into four characters
C first prune top 8 bits
	IPAT = 0
	DO 10 I=0,3
	   J = IAND(ISHFT(PATTERN, -6*I),'3F'X) + ISHFT(I,6)
	   IPAT = IOR(IPAT, ISHFT(J,8*I))	! shift into position
10	CONTINUE
C
C write out the four characters
	STATUS = SYS$QIOW(,	
     &		      %VAL(B_BOX_ASTCHAN),! same channel as AST line

C relay error back
