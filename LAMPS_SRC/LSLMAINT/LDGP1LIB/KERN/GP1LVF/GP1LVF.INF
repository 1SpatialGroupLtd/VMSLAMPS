INTRODUCTION
[1w[11;88s

The GP1 PLOTTER LIBRARY is the  software interface  between the
plotter  and the  driving computer.  The library  converts code
input by the user or plot file into GP1 code. It is written for
Pascal and Fortran-4.


The user may choose between three modes:
[5w[6;88s
OFF LINE
[1w[11;88s
The GP1 code is stored on a file. This  file may  later be sent
to the plotter, using a plot program.  The GP1 need not  to  be
connected with the computer.

[5w[6;88s
ON  LINE
[1w[11;88s
The GP1 code is sent immediately to the GP1.  The GP1 has to be
connected with  the computer and ready for use. A plot file  is
not produced.

[5w[6;88s
ON  and OFF LINE
[1w[11;88s
This mode combines the OFF LINE and the ON LINE modes.


The GP1 library contains programs to:

- Connect given  points with  straight lines  or  with a smooth
  curve (natural spline interpolation)
- Change and scale line types
- Change, scale and rotate symbols
- Write, scale, rotate and slant text
- Changes the text type in the GP1 (if GP1 option installed)
- Draw circles, spirals and parts thereof
- Define and clear a window
- Set a local origin
- Scale the x or the y coordinates
- Change the pen number
- Move the pen up or down
- Change the plotting speed
- Obtain GP1 coordinates (digitize)
- Define and downloading 32 user symbols
- Plotting of data-files
- Dialogue program driving all GP1 functions
- CALCOMP calls PLOT, NUMBER, SYMBOL, FACTOR  (only in Fortran)



The library is available for DEC PDP-11 computers with an RT-11
operating system and Fortran-4 or OMSI-Pascal-2  compilers.  It
is  easy  to adapt the library to other operating systems which
have a FORTRAN or PASCAL compiler.
