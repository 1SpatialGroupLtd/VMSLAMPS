2.Installation Guide
[1w[9;80s

     This Installation Guide covers the installation of the GP1
     User Library Package delivered in TK50 Cassette or
     RX50 Floppy Disks onto a VAX with MicroVMS Operating System.

     All of the Kern Software is delivered on one TK50 cassette
     or on one volume of floppy diskettes ( comprising several
     physical diskettes ).

     Refer to the appropriate following section depending on
     whether software is being installed for the first time or
     an update version is being installed.

     If using a cassstte and if the software has already been
     installed e.g. using the Kern Software installation guide,
     KERN.INS, then the software does not need to be copied
     again from the cassette. Simply refer to the appropriate
     section for new or update installation for information
     about which files are required.

     2.1   New Installation

       1.  create a user for the Kern Software
           see MicroVMS AUTHORIZE Utility

       2.  create a directory for the user library,
           see MicroVMS DCL Command for CREATE/DIR

       3.  set the default to this directory

       4.  insert the delivered cassette/floppy

       5.  mount the cassette/floppy with
             MOUNT/FOR $TAPE1 or
             MOUNT/FOR $FLOPPY1

       6.  copy all files to the default directory with
             BACKUP/LOG/VERIFY $TAPE1:GP1LVF.SAV/SAVE_SET * or
             BACKUP/LOG/VERIFY $FLOPPY1:GP1LVF.SAV/SAVE_SET *

       7.  dismount the cassette/floppy with
             DISMOUNT $TAPE1 or
             DISMOUNT $FLOPPY1

       8.  The new program files, source files and documentation
           for the GP1 User Library are now in the
           User Library directory.

           The documentation files do not need to reside on
           the disk and may be deleted.

           Refer to the user's manual for further details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

         2.2 Update Installation

         Read the document GP1LVF.NEW to familiarize yourself with
         the differences between your existing version and this new
         version of the software.

           1.  create a new directory for the update user library

           2.  set the default to this directory

           3.  insert the delivered cassette/floppy

           4.  mount the cassette/floppy with
                 MOUNT/FOR $TAPE1 or
                 MOUNT/FOR $FLOPPY1

           5.  copy all files to the default directory with
                 BACKUP/LOG/VERIFY $TAPE1:GP1LVF.SAV/SAVE_SET * or
                 BACKUP/LOG/VERIFY $FLOPPY1:GP1LVF.SAV/SAVE_SET *

           6.  dismount the cassette/floppy with
                 DISMOUNT $TAPE1 or
                 DISMOUNT $FLOPPY1

           7.  copy the new software from the new update user library
               directory to the old existing GP1 user library directory.

           8.  delete all the files in the new update user library
               directory

           9.  delete the update user library directory.


           Refer to the user's manual for further details.

3. Further Notes
[1w[9;80s

     3.1 Building the library

     The command  file GP1LVF.COM  is utilized for building the
     library  for on  line plotting and off line plotting
     respectively.

     To build a new library:

     - The  linker,  library-utility,  compiler  and  system-
       library should be installed on the system device
     - The GP1  plotter  library  source  moduls should  be  on
       the working  device
     - "@GP1LVF"  compiles  the  moduls  and  builds the library.
       As result the file GP1LVF.OLB  contains  the fortran
       library for a DEC VAX.


     3.2 Software Requirements

     - The line  to  the GP1 must  be a terminal-line,  which is
       not spooled and not queued.
     - The  line  should   not  have  a  protection.  Otherwise
       the assigning in the initialization fails  (put  in startup-
       command for example  SET PROT=WO:RWLP/DEV $TERNMINAL2).
     - The line should set to "TYPEAHEAD"
       (for example  SET TERMINAL $TERMINAL2 /TYPEAHEAD).
     - The value "PLOOTTER_LINE" has to  be  declared  (for example
       DEFINE PLOTTER_LINE $TERMINAL2). This needs the OPER
       privilege.
