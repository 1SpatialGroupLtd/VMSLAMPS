C To convert a 2-digit integer to characters, and output it to file
C
	INTEGER*2	INT	! the integer to be output
	INTEGER*4	PTR	! pointer to where the characters are to go
C
C w/s
	INTEGER*2	CH	! we only actually really need a BYTE, but
C				!  VAX Fortran insists on doing all its
C				!  arithemetic (in this area) in words, so
C				!  we have to swim with the tide. It makes no
C				!  difference with PDP Fortran.
C
C check in range
	IF (INT.LT.0 .OR. INT.GE.100)
     &      CALL WRITEF('*** DITFIL - integer out of range')
C
C put 10s
	CH = (INT/10)+'0'
	CALL WFBYTE(PTR, CH)
C
C put units
	CH = MOD(INT,10)+'0'
	CALL WFBYTE(PTR, CH)

C now that wasn't too bad, was it?
	RETURN
