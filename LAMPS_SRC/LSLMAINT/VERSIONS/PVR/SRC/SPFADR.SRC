C To split a file address (for the 'read' file)
C  into block number and byte offset
C
	INTEGER*4 PTR
C
C PTR is the byte address of the word in the file
C     (0=>byte 0 of virtual block 1)

C workspace
	INTEGER*4 PBYT, PBLK

C extract byte, block
	PBYT = PTR.AND.511
	PBLK = (PTR/512)+1
C (assume PBLK<65536!)
C
C no fancy stuff if block already in memory

C ensure previous block up to date

C current block is now this new block

C
C get new block to memory
	CALL FLRBLK(FIBBUF(0),, FIBBLK)
