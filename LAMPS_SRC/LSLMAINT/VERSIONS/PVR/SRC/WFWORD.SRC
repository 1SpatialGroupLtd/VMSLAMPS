C
C Coded and typed 6.v.81
C
C To write one word to the currently-selected
C  LIOLIB write-file
C
	INTEGER*4 PTR
C
C PTR is the byte oddress of the word in the file
C     (0=> byte 0 of virtual block 1 of the file)
C     the subroutine advances PTR by 2
C
	INTEGER*2 WD
C
C WD is the word to be written to the file
C
C w/s
	BYTE WFBYT(2)
	INTEGER WFBYTW
	EQUIVALENCE (WFBYTW,WFBYT)
C
C copy the word argument to the equivalenced area
	WFBYTW = WD
C
C now simply write to the file, one byte at a time
	CALL WFBYTE(PTR, WFBYT(1))
	CALL WFBYTE(PTR, WFBYT(2))
	RETURN
C
	END
