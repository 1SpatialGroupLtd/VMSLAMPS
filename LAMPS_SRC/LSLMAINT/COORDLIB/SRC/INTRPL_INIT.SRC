C Description
C
C 	TOLER(1) is the constant separation for curve and linear 
C	interpolation
C	TOLER(2) is the arc to chord distance for curve interpolation
C	TOLER(3) is the angular deviation for curve interpolation
C
C	SFACTOR is a scale factor which should be 1.0 if dealing with 
C	IFf units
C
C	DRAWING is true if curve is being drawn on screen
