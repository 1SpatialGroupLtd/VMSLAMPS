C Four point transform routine
C Arguments are :-
C CS is array of the four points in count space (input space).
C	CS is presumed to be reasonably square
C MS is array of the four points in map space (target space).
C X,Y are the coordinates of the input point to be transformed.
C XX,YY are coordinates of the point in the target space.
C 
C indices of the four points are :-
C	1	4
C
C	2	3
C
	REAL CS(2,4),MS(2,4)
	DOUBLE PRECISION D,A,B,W1,W2,W3,W4
C
C assume will work
	MCF4PT=.FALSE.
C D is dot product of one side with perpendicular to other.
	D=(CS(1,3)-CS(1,2))*(CS(2,1)-CS(2,2)) -
     &    (CS(1,1)-CS(1,2))*(CS(2,3)-CS(2,2))
	IF(D.EQ.0) GOTO 99
C
C A & B are fractional positions of point within four points
	A=((CS(2,1)-CS(2,2))*(X-CS(1,2)) -
     &     (CS(1,1)-CS(1,2))*(Y-CS(2,2)))/D
	B=((CS(2,2)-CS(2,3))*(X-CS(1,2)) -
     &     (CS(1,2)-CS(1,3))*(Y-CS(2,2)))/D
C
C W 1 to 4 are the weights for the four points.
	W1=(1-A)*B
	W2=(1-A)*(1-B)
	W3=A*(1-B)
	W4=A*B
C
C answer is weighted sum
	XX=MS(1,1)*W1 + MS(1,2)*W2 + MS(1,3)*W3 + MS(1,4)*W4
	YY=MS(2,1)*W1 + MS(2,2)*W2 + MS(2,3)*W3 + MS(2,4)*W4
C
	RETURN
C error - bad transform
99	MCF4PT=.TRUE.
	XX=X
	YY=Y
	RETURN
C
	END
