C This function gets and maps a global section for us
C More precisely, it interfaces to MAKSEC
C
C We return TRUE if this fails, and FALSE if all is well
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
	INCLUDE	'($SSDEF)'
C
C common, etc
C
***	PARAMETER/CMN:TABMON/
***	COMMON/CMN:TABNAMES/
***	COMMON/CMN:SECTION/		! section addresses, etc
C
C we were passed
C
	INTEGER*4	IERR		! error return
C
C and we call
C
	LOGICAL		MAKSEC		! make & map the section
	INTEGER*4	VIOCLR		! clear a section
C
C and local workspace
C
	INTEGER*4	PAGCNT		! how many pages we wish
C
C
C so let us make & map the thing
C - assume failure
C
	NEWSEC = .TRUE.
C
C we only wish the one page, so
C
	PAGCNT = 1
C
	IERR = MAKSEC(SEC_NAME(1:SECL),SEC_ADDR,PAGCNT,SEC_CHAN)
	IF ( .NOT.IERR ) GOTO 9999
C
	NEWSEC = .FALSE.		! success
C
C so copy the version identification number into the section
C
	CALL COPY_LONG( FILE_VERSION, %VAL(SEC_BASE+SECTION_VERSION) )
C
C and clear the EXTRA_FLGS field in case it is the old TABLIB that is
C being used
	CALL COPY_LONG(0,%VAL(SEC_BASE+EXTRA_FLGS))
C
9999	RETURN
	END
