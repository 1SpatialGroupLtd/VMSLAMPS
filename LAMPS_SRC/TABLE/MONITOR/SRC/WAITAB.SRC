C Wait for a response from the digitising table, or for HIBERNATE from
C the library...

C system parameters

C
***	PARAMETER/HERE:ERROR/		! error numbers

C and we call

	INTEGER*4	SYS$WFLOR	! wait for an event flag
C
C
C local workspace
C
	INTEGER*4	IERR		! return from the function
C
C and just wait for one of the table monitor event flags to be set
C
C if there is an outstanding request for a button from the TABLIB,
C then we don't want to wait for that event flag, since it's already
C set...
C
	IF ( BUTN_REQ ) THEN
C
C	 the puck efn, or HIBERNATE, only
C
	   IF (EXTRA_FLG) THEN

C
C and note the time at which this wait finishes...
C
	CALL SYS$GETTIM( AFTER )
C
C did it finish succesfully?
C
