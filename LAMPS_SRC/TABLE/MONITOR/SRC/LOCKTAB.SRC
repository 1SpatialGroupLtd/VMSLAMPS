C
C This routine attempts to place a null lock on the resource
C LOCKT_NAME
C
C This is the same lock as TABLIB should have in exclusive mode.
C We attempt to grab this lock in POKE_TABLE so as to fire off
C the blocking AST in TABLIB.
C
C We return TRUE if this fails, but FALSE on success

C
C start off with pessimism
C
	LOCK_TABLE = .TRUE.
C
C now let us attempt the lock...
C
	IERR = SYS$ENQW(
     &			,			! efn
     &			%VAL(LCK$K_NLMODE),	! null lock
     &			TABLE_STATUS,		! status block

     &			LOCKT_NAME(1:LOCKTL),	! resource name
     &			,			! parent lock ID
     &			,			! astadr
     &			,			! astprm
     &			,			! blocking ast
     &			,			! access mode
     &			 )			! final arg reserved
C
C what status do we have for the enqueue?
C
	IF ( IERR.NE.SS$_NORMAL ) GOTO 9999
C
C and what was the final status?
C
	IF ( TABLE_STATUS(1).NE.SS$_NORMAL ) THEN
	   IERR = TABLE_STATUS(1)
	   GOTO 9999
	ENDIF
C
C otherwise, we have success
C
	LOCK_TABLE = .FALSE.
C
9999	RETURN
	END
