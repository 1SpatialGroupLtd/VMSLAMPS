C This subroutine writes the coordinates from the stream button
C into the global section
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C define our offsets
C
***	PARAMETER/CMN:TABMON.PAR/
C
C and common which holds the relevant addresses for the section
C
***	COMMON/CMN:SECTION/
C
C and to remember our current position in
C
***	COMMON/HERE:STREAM/		! for OLDX,OLDY
C
C and functions
C
	LOGICAL		WRITE_LOCK	! establish an exclusive
C					! lock on the section
	LOGICAL		UNLOCK		! release the lock again
	LOGICAL		POKE_TABLE	! signal to TABLIB
C
C local workspace
C
	INTEGER*4	X,Y		! streamed coordinate
C
C
C first we must ensure that we have the lock
C
	IF ( WRITE_LOCK() ) GOTO 9999	! give up if can't
C
C and so let us copy things over - but only if the coordinates
C have actually changed
C
	IF ( X.NE.OLDX .OR. Y.NE.OLDY ) THEN
	   CALL COPY_LONG( X,    %VAL( SEC_BASE+STREAM_X ) )
	   CALL COPY_LONG( Y,    %VAL( SEC_BASE+STREAM_Y ) )
	ENDIF
C
C and set the 'streamed' event flag anyway - note we don't check
C its success - we don't care whether it was already set or not
C
	CALL SYS$SETEF( %VAL(STREAMED) )
C
C finally signal to TABLIB that an event has happened
C
	IF ( POKE_TABLE() ) GOTO 9999
C
C and now unlock
C
	IF ( UNLOCK() ) GOTO 9999
C
C update the remembered coordinates
C
	OLDX = X
	OLDY = Y
C
C and that is all we do
C
9999	RETURN
	END
