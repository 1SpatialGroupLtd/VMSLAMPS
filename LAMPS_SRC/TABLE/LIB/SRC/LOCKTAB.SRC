C
C This routine places an exlusive lock on the complex which
C represents use of the table monitor / digitising table
C
C By doing this, it prevents other processes from using TABLIB at the
C same time as we are
C
C The AST routine is established as a blocking AST for the lock.
C It is triggered when TABMON attempts to assert this lock as a
C signal that an event has happened.
C If the AST argument is missing, the previous AST is re-established.
C
C We return TRUE if this fails, but FALSE on success

C arguments
C
	INTEGER*4	IERR		! return from function
	EXTERNAL	AST		! user's AST routine
C
C start off with pessimism
C
	LOCK_TABLE = .TRUE.
C
C now let us attempt the lock...
C
	IERR = SYS$ENQW(
     &			,			! efn
     &			%VAL(LCK$K_EXMODE),	! exclusive lock
     &			TABLE_STATUS,		! status block
     &			%VAL(LCK$M_NOQUEUE),	! don't queue request
     &			LOCKT_NAME(1:LOCKTL),	! resource name
     &			,			! parent lock ID
     &			,			! astadr
     &			,			! astprm
     &			AST,			! blocking ast
     &			,			! access mode
     &			 )			! final arg reserved
C
C what status do we have for the enqueue?
C
	IF ( IERR.NE.SS$_NORMAL ) GOTO 9999
C
C and what was the final status?
C
	IF ( TABLE_STATUS(1).NE.SS$_NORMAL ) THEN
	   IERR = TABLE_STATUS(1)
	   GOTO 9999
	ENDIF
C
C otherwise, we have success
C
	TABLE_BLKAST = %LOC(AST)
	LOCK_TABLE = .FALSE.
C
9999	RETURN
	END
