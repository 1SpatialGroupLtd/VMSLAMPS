C This routine attempts to place a protected read lock on the
C resource LSL_TABLE_LOCK
C
C It returns TRUE if it fails, but FALSE on success

C
C start off with pessimism
C
	READ_LOCK = .TRUE.
C
C now let us attempt the lock...
C
	IERR = SYS$ENQW(
     &			,			! efn
     &			%VAL(LCK$K_PRMODE),	! protected read
     &			STATUS,			! status block

     &			,			! astprm
     &			,			! blocking ast
     &			,			! access mode
     &			 )			! final arg reserved
C
C what status do we have for the enqueue?
C
	IF ( IERR.NE.SS$_NORMAL ) GOTO 9999
C
C and what was the final status?
C
	IF ( STATUS(1).NE.SS$_NORMAL ) THEN
	   IERR = STATUS(1)
	   GOTO 9999
	ENDIF
C
C otherwise, we have success
C
	READ_LOCK = .FALSE.
C
9999	RETURN
	END
