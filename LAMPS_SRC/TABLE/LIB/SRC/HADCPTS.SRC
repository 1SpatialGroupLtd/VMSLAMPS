C This function returns TRUE if the 'had corner points inserted' word
C in the global section is true, and FALSE if it's not
C

C system parameters

C and functions
C
	LOGICAL		READ_LOCK	! establish a protected read
C					! lock on the section
	LOGICAL		UNLOCK		! release the lock again
C
C passed
C
	INTEGER*4	IERR		! error return
C
C workspace
C
	BYTE		STATE		! state of the flag
C
C assume that the state is FALSE
C
	HAD_CPTS = .FALSE.		! got no corner points
C
C first we must ensure that we have the lock
C
	IF ( READ_LOCK(IERR) ) GOTO 9999
C
C and so let us copy things over
C
	CALL COPY_BYTE( %VAL( SEC_BASE+SET_CPTS ), STATE )
C
	HAD_CPTS = STATE		! get TRUE or FALSE from it
C
C and now unlock
C
	IF ( UNLOCK(IERR) ) GOTO 9999
C
C and that is all we do
C
9999	RETURN
	END
