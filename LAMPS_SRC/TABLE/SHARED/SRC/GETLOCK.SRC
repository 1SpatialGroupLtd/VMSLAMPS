C This routine attempts to place a null lock on the resource
C LSL_TABLE_LOCK
C
C By doing this, it creates the lock, and gives us a handle to it
C
C We return TRUE if this fails, but FALSE on success
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C lock definitions and system definitions
C
	INCLUDE		'($LCKDEF)'

C local parameters
C
***	PARAMETER/CMN:TABMON/		! for name of lock
C
C and common

C functions used
C
	INTEGER*4	SYS$ENQW	! enqueue a lock request
C					! and wait for result

C workspace
C
	INTEGER*4	IERR		! return from function
C
C
C start off with pessimism
C
	GETLOCK = .TRUE.
C
C now let us attempt the lock...
C
	IERR = SYS$ENQW(
     &			,			! efn
     &			%VAL(LCK$K_NLMODE),	! null lock
     &			STATUS,			! status block
     &			,			! flags
     &			LOCK_NAME(1:LOCKL),	! resource name
     &			,			! parent lock ID
     &			,			! astadr
     &			,			! astprm
     &			,			! blocking ast
     &			,			! access mode
     &			 )			! final arg reserved
C
C what status do we have for the enqueue?
C
	IF ( IERR.NE.SS$_NORMAL ) GOTO 9999
C
C and what was the final status?
C
	IF ( STATUS(1).NE.SS$_NORMAL ) THEN
	   IERR = STATUS(1)
	   GOTO 9999
	ENDIF
C
C otherwise, we have success
C
	GETLOCK = .FALSE.
C
9999	RETURN
	END
