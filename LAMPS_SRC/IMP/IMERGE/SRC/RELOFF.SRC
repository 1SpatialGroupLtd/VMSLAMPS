C Routine to determine the minimum origin offset from the input files.
C This possibly contrived offset in the case of "L" shaped maps, is
C to be the output file origin offset. With luck not all of the input 
C files will have had different origin offsets, we can uses EIHCPY on 
C STs having common origin  offset which will be much faster. The input 
C file offsets relative to the output file origin offset are placed in
C /COMMAND/LOCOFF.

C First calc. the output file origin offset.
	OUTXOF=OFFSET(1,1)
	OUTYOF=OFFSET(2,1)
	DO 10 IFIL=1,NUMPAR
	   IF (OFFSET(1,IFIL).LT.OUTXOF) OUTXOF=OFFSET(1,IFIL)
	   IF (OFFSET(2,IFIL).LT.OUTYOF) OUTYOF=OFFSET(2,IFIL)
10	CONTINUE
C
C Now calc. the local offsets relative to the output file origin offset.
	DO 20 IFIL=1,NUMPAR
	   LOCOFF(1,IFIL)=SNGL(OFFSET(1,IFIL)-OUTXOF)
	   LOCOFF(2,IFIL)=SNGL(OFFSET(2,IFIL)-OUTYOF)
20	CONTINUE
	RETURN
