C Function to check for duplicated filenames supplied to IMP utility 
C IMERGE. The SPECAL flag is set .T. if the special case of output
C file equals the single input file specified.
C
C Function returns 4 condition codes:
C
C	SS$_NORMAL		-   all is well
C	IMERGE__INVCPQUAL	-   /CP_EXPANSION specified when infile 
C				    is the same as outfile (!)
C	IMERGE__DUPINFIL	-   two input files share the same name
C
C	IMERGE__DUPOUTFIL	-   the two output IFF files share the
C                                   same name

C Assume the best.

C Init SPECAL. This will be set .T. if the special case of outfile
C equal to single infile is detected.
	SPECAL=	.FALSE.

C command line.

C
C Check that SPECAL is not set if we have had /CP_EXPANSION.
C It is a nonsense to ask for CP expansion when the infile is the same 
C as the outfile!

C Now check for duplicate input file specs. A clash here would be
C very silly as "double digitising" would result in the output file.
