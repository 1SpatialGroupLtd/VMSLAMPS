C	IMP IWINDOW Program - Copy over TC/CH entries
C
C Description
C
C	It is expected that the input IFF file is currently selected
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Included Parameter Files
C
***	PARAMETER/LSL$CMNIWIN:IWINMSG/	! message definitions
***	PARAMETER/LSL$CMNIWIN:LUN/	! unit numbers
***	PARAMETER/LSL$CMNIWIN:MAX/	! maximum things
C
C Common Blocks
C
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNIFF:IFFHAN/	! current position in IFF file
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNIWIN:COPY/	! transfer for output
C
C Local Variables
C
	INTEGER*2	IELEN		! length of entry in hand
	INTEGER*2	IECODE		! entry code of entry in hand
	INTEGER*4	CURPOS		! holds input file IFF position
	LOGICAL		OK		! everything OK ?
C
C Initialisation
C
	OK = .TRUE.
C
C Position to the TC
C
	CURPOS = LPOSH			! remember current position
	CALL IFFPKE(IECODE,IELEN,TCPOS)

C
C While no errors and entry is a TC/CH, deal with it
C

C
C Copy the entry over and get the next one
