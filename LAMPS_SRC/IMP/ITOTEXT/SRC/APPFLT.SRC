CMOD	APPFLT created from EXPFLT		 DM	14-Mar-1984
C	EXPFLT adapted from code written by DM	RJH	07-Mar-1984
C
C This function appends a real number to EXPBUF. Care is taken that only
C seven significant digits are output (it mimics FORTRAN free-format
C output in this respect). The function returns the number of characters
C in EXPBUF after the real number has been appended.
C Note that the accuracy of the last digit is not guaranteed (if anybody
C ever has any problems with this, please tell DM).

C argument:
	REAL		FLT		! real number
C 
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNLSL:EXPC/
C
	BYTE		ICH		! current character in EXPBUF
	INTEGER*4	ALL		! total no. of chars in EXPBUF
	INTEGER*4	I,J		! counters

C function:
	INTEGER*4	APPEND
C
C ......................................................................
C
	I=APPEND(0)			! get no. of chars in EXPBUF now
	ALL=APPEND('%F0.7',FLT + SIGN(FLT*1.0E-7,FLT))
C
C ... don't APPEND more than is necessary/justified.
	J=0				! J is position in number
10	I=I + 1				! I is position in EXPBUF
	   ICH=EXPBUF(I)
	   IF (ICH.EQ.'-') GO TO 10	! ignore sign
	   IF (ICH.EQ.'.') GO TO 20
	   J=J + 1			! J is number of sig. figs
	   IF (J.LE.7) GO TO 10	! (max is 7 for real*4)
	   EXPBUF(I)='0'		! don't output random gunk
	GO TO 10
C
C ... found decimal point - deal with decimals.
20	I=I + 1
	   J=J + 1
	   IF (J.GT.7) GO TO 30		! check we're still significant
	   IF (I.EQ.ALL) GO TO 40	! got to last character ?
	GO TO 20
30	EXPBUF(I)='0'			! don't output random gunk
C
C ... now lose trailing zeros (I points to last character).
40	EXPLEN=I
	   I=I - 1
	IF (EXPBUF(EXPLEN).EQ.'0'.AND.EXPBUF(I).NE.'.') GO TO 40
	EXPBUF(EXPLEN+1)=0		! zero terminate EXPBUF
C
C ... finish up (let APPEND set /EXPC/ pointers, etc).
	APPFLT=APPEND(0)		! number of chars in EXPBUF
	RETURN
