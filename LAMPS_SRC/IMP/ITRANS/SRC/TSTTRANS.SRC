C	    Add GCTP_CF_PROJ to compare the projection parameters

	LOGICAL		SAME
C
C assume transformation is necessary
C
	TSTTRANS = .TRUE.
C
C always transform if doing datum shift
C
	IF (HAD_DATUM) GOTO 900
C
C check projections
C
	IF (INSYS.NE.OUTSYS) GOTO 900
C
C check zones (only for UTM and SPS)
C
	IF (INSYS.EQ.1 .OR. INSYS.EQ.2) THEN
	   IF (INZONE.NE.OUTZONE) GOTO 900
	ENDIF	   
C
C check units (these are units that GCTP knows about)
C
	IF (INUNIT.NE.OUTUNIT) GOTO 900
C
C now check all the parameters relevant to the specific projection
C
	CALL GCTP_CF_PROJ(INSYS,PARIN,PAROUT,SAME)
	IF (.NOT.SAME) GOTO 900
C
C	DO 10,I=1,15
C	   IF (PARIN(I).NE.PAROUT(I)) GOTO 900
C10	CONTINUE
C
C if everything up to here is the same, then no need to do GCTP
C transformation
C
	TSTTRANS = .FALSE.
C
  900	CONTINUE
C
	RETURN
   	END
