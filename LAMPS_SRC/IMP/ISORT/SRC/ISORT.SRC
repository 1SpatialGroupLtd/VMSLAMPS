C This module is an IFF sort program. Its primary purpose is to
C sort the features in an IFF file into ascending Feature Serial Number
C (FSN) order. It outputs a summary of FSN allocation including
C duplicated features and maps. If duplicated FSN's are present the
C /NODUPLICATES qualifier may be used to override the default of
C retaining all features with duplicate FSN. When /NODUPLICATES is
C selected only the first feature with a duplicated FSN in a given layer
C is kept. Alternatively, the /INTERNAL qualifier may be specified in
C order that the sorting may be based on the feature's internal sequence
C number (ISN) instead of the FSN as this will be unique within a given
C file.
