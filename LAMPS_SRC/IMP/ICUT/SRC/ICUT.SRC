C	This module is an IMP utility which creates a new IFF file
C	containing features processed from features in the input IFF file
C	features are selected on the basis of LAYER or FC.
C	  Output features are created according to the number of points 
C	per feature, or their length. In addition ancillary codes can be 
C	attached.
