C RESCALE converts the CP coordinates held in /IFF_ENT/CPARRY to the
C measurement system demanded by the user.
C
C Function returns set to SS$_NORMAL if all is well.

	IMPLICIT NONE

C Parameters:
C
	INTEGER*4 SS$_NORMAL
	EXTERNAL  SS$_NORMAL		! normal successful completion
C
C Longword:
	INTEGER	I,J,K			! loop variables
C
C Real:
	REAL	SCAL			! for re-scaling
	REAL	XYTEMP(2)		! for shifting local origin

C If /COUNTS was specified we should not remove the SW control
C point coordinate values from all the corners. And of course no
C rescaling is nessary. Just copy the RHS CP values to the LHS

15	  CONTINUE

C If /CENTRE was specified we should not remove the SW control 
C point coordinate values from all the corners, but we SHOULD
C do any rescaling required. Then copy the RHS values to the LHS.
