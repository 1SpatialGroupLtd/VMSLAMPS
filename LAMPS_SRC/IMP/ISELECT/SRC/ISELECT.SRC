C	This module is an IMP utility which creates a new IFF file
C	containing features selected from an existing IFF file on the
C	basis of attributes specified by qualifiers on the command line.
C	If no qualifiers are specified then the entire contents of the
C	input file are copied into the output file.
C	All specified attributes have to match for a feature to be 
C	copied.
