C Local Variables
C
	REAL*4		DX		! difference in X
	REAL*4		DY		! difference in Y
	REAL*4		RES		! resolution
C
C Calculate the resolution - based on OS large scale map sheets.
C The standard sheet edge length is 400mm, which represents 500m or 
C 1000m on the ground at 1/1250 or 1/2500 scale respectively. 
C Resolution is assumed to be 0.25mm on the map sheet. Thus the range 
C should be divided by 1600 to find the quantity in metres representing 
C the resolution. 
C
	DX = RANGE(HI,X) - RANGE(LO,X)
	DY = RANGE(HI,Y) - RANGE(LO,Y)
	RES = (DX + DY) / 3200	! N.B. we are dividing double the range
