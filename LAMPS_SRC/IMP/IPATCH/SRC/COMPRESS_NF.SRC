C to compress the NF_PTR array, after some NF entries have been deleted
C
	IMPLICIT NONE

C arguments
C
	INTEGER		FIRST		! the first NF index deleted
	INTEGER		LAST		! the last

C so copy the upper part of the array over the lower
C
C source	- array to copy starts at LAST+1
C length	- in bytes
C destination	- overwrite FIRST
C
	CALL VIOMV3( NF_PTR(LAST+1), (LAST_NF+1-LAST)*4, NF_PTR(FIRST) )

C and adjust the length of the array, and thus also where HIGHWATER is
C
	LAST_NF = LAST_NF - (LAST-FIRST) -1
C
	HIGHWATER = NF_PTR(LAST_NF+1)

	RETURN
	END
