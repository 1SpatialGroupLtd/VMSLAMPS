C firstly, work out what we're being asked to do
C - note that our caller has already made sure that we have SOME
C   arguments to use
C
	BOT = INTARG(1)
	IF ( CMDICT.EQ.1 ) THEN
	   TOP = BOT
	ELSE
	   TOP = INTARG(2)
	ENDIF
C
C check that the numbers make sense
C
	IF ( BOT.LT.1 .OR. BOT.GT.CBH.NROW ) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG( IPATCH__INTRANGE, BOT, 1, CBH.NROW )
	   GOTO 9000
	ELSEIF ( TOP.LT.1 .OR. TOP.GT.CBH.NROW ) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG( IPATCH__INTRANGE, TOP, 1, CBH.NROW )
	   GOTO 9000
	ELSEIF ( TOP.LT.BOT ) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG( IPATCH__ORDER, BOT, TOP )
	   GOTO 9000
	ENDIF
C
C **********************************************************************
C so do the replacement
C
	DO 2000 I = BOT, TOP
	   IF ( PROMPT_CB(I) ) THEN
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG( IPATCH__NOCHANGE )
	      GOTO 9000
	   ENDIF
2000	CONTINUE
C
C and if we finish, then that's success
C
	EDIT_CB_CHANGE = .FALSE.
C
C **********************************************************************
C and that's it
C
9000	RETURN
	END
