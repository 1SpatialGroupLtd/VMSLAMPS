C assume that we succeed
C
	PROMPT_REAL = .FALSE.
C
C so prompt the user
C
2000	IF ( READ_PROMPT( PROMPT, ' ' ) ) THEN
	   PROMPT_REAL = .TRUE.			! failure
	   GOTO 9000
	ENDIF
C
C check if they replied with anything
C
	IF ( RDCHS(ICH) ) GOTO 9000		! nothing - just return
C
C try to read the number in
C
	CALL BSCH
	IF ( RDREAL(NUMBER) ) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG(ERRNUM)
	   IF ( ERRNUM.EQ.LSL__HADEXCP ) CALL LSL_ADDMSG(LSL_EXCP)
	   GOTO 2000
	ENDIF
C
C and make sure there's nothing else on the line
C
	IF ( CHECK_EOL() ) GOTO 2000
C
C so we have the value
C
	VALUE = NUMBER
C
C and return
C
9000	RETURN
	END
