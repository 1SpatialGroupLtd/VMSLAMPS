C To move to and type the next <n> entries of the IFF file
C - note that the default action is just to type the current entry
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C arguments
C
	LOGICAL		FOREVER		! if true, type to end of file

C if the TYPE command had an argument, then it is either the number of
C entries we are to TYPE, or a wild-card meaning type forever
C
C - if the argument is less than zero, then we refuse to do anything

	IF ( .NOT.FOREVER ) THEN
	   IF ( ARGMSG ) THEN
	      SPAN = 0		! default is same as TYPE 0
	   ELSE
