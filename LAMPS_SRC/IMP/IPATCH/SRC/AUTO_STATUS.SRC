C ***********************************************************************
C since we are trying to start up the status line automatically, we must
C be careful
C
C If we are talking to a terminal, then a status line seems sensible
C However, if we are being run from a command file, we don't really
C want to muck up the display! In the latter case, although SYS$OUTPUT:
C will be the terminal, SYS$INPUT: will be the file (unless the user
C is talking to us directly, in which case we do want the status, after
C all)
C
C Did you understand all of that?
C
       	IF ( IS_TERM_ANSI( 'SYS$INPUT:' ) ) THEN
	   CALL STATUS_ON
	ENDIF
C
C (note that, in tru belts-and-braces style, the call of STATUS_ON
C  will also check that SYS$OUTPUT: is an ANSI terminal)
C
	RETURN
	END
