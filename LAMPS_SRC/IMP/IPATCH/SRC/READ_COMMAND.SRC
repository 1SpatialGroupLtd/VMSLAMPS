C if we hit the end of file, then return LSL__NORMAL, but tell the user
C and log something appropriate. We also unset COMMAND so that we will go
C back to prompting.
C
C if we get an error, then report that it's in command reading, but leave
C the main reporting to our caller. Note that if we had a SYSREAD error,
C we fudge it to look like the SYSERR error that TTRSTR would have returned
