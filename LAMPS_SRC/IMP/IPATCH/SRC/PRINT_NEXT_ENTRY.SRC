C To move to and print the next <n> entries of the IFF file
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C arguments
C
	LOGICAL		FOREVER		! if true, print to end of file
C
C **********************************************************************
C parameter files

C common files

C
	INTEGER	 	SPAN		! number of times to NEXT

C **********************************************************************
C if the NEXT command had an argument, then it is either the number of
C entries we are to NEXT over, or a wild-card, meaning 'forever'
C
C - if the argument is zero or less, then we refuse to do anything
C - if FOREVER is requested, but DISPLAY is OFF, then we also refuse
C   to do anything
C
	IF ( FOREVER ) THEN
	   IF ( .NOT.DISPLAY ) THEN
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG( IPATCH__WILDNEXT )
	      GOTO 9000
	   ENDIF
	ELSEIF ( ARGMSG ) THEN
	   SPAN = 1		! default is same as NEXT 1
	ELSE
	   SPAN = INTARG(1)
	   IF ( SPAN.LE.0 ) THEN
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG( IPATCH__BADNEXT )
	      GOTO 9000
	   ENDIF
    	ENDIF
C
C so do the work
C
	CALL NEXT_ENTRY( FOREVER, SPAN, .FALSE. )
C
C and return
