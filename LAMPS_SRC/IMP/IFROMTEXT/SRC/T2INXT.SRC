C Description
C
C This subroutine is designed for use by the IFROMTEXT program, and its
C purpose is to find the next IFF entry in the current input text file.
C Lines which do not have valid IFF codes at the beginning are ignored.
C The new input file line may or may not have been read in on entry to
C this subroutine, and is therefore read in if necessary. Communication
C with other routines is via the common block T2IPAR.

C Argument:
	LOGICAL		WHINGE		! whinge if not IFF entry
