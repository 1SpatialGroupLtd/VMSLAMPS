C Description
C
C    This subroutine is designed for use by the IFROMTEXT program, and its
C purpose is to output a message when corrupted data has been found on
C the current input line.
C    Arguments expected are a copy of the input line decoding pointer
C before the data was read, and a character string describing the data.
C    If the pointer passed has the same value as the current decoding
C pointer, it is assumed that an illegal character was found before the
C data could be read. Otherwise, it is assumed that several characters
C have been read and the data corrupted in some way. In either case the
C characters are echoed in the message output.
C    Communication with other routines is via the common block T2IPAR.
