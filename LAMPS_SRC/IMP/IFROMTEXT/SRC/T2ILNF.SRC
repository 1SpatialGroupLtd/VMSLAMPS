C Description
C
C    This function is designed for use by the IFROMTEXT program, and its
C purpose is to read an integer expected on the current input line.
C    The function takes the value false if successful, and true if
C i) the number was corrupted, ii) nothing was found on the line, or
C iii) an illegal separator was encountered.
C    If the function was successful, the first argument returned is the
C integer read. If unsuccessful, this argument will be unchanged unless
C an attempt was made to read an integer, in which case it will be zero.
C The second argument is a logical variable which takes the value true
C if the function failed due to a read error, false if it failed because
C nothing was found on the line.
C    Communication with other routines is via the common block T2IPAR.
