C Description
C
C Reads the next date string in the input file. If not found on
C the current line, a date string is expected on the next non-blank 
C line.
C
C The function takes the value false if successful, and true if:
C   i) the date string was corrupted,
C  ii) the date was not found before the
C      next IFF code,
C iii) an illegal separator was encountered, or
C  iv) an input file read error occurred.
C
C If the function was successful, the argument returned is the
C real read. If unsuccessful, the argument will be unchanged unless
C an attempt was made to read a real, in which case it will be zero.
C Communication with other routines is via the common block T2IPAR.
