C Description
C
C    This function is designed for use by the IFROMTEXT program, and its
C purpose is to skip the map header (MH) entry in the input file, if
C this entry is in the readable format.
C    The function takes the value false if successful, and true if
C i) an illegal separator was encountered on the first line of the
C entry, or ii) an input file read error occurred.
C    The argument returned will be true if the MH entry was in the
C readable format, false otherwise.
C    Communication with other routines is via the common block T2IPAR.
