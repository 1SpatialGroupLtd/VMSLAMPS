C    This subroutine is designed for use by the IFROMTEXT program, and it
C tests the first non-blank character on an input line. The character is
C found in the common block T2IPAR, and the result of the test passed to

C (upper or lower case), false otherwise. In the former case it is
C assumed that an IFF code appears at the beginning of the line.
