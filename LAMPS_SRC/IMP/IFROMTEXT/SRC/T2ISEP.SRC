C Description
C
C    This function is designed for use by the IFROMTEXT program, and its
C purpose is to read and skip data separators; blanks, tabs or commas
C are valid. It is expected that the next character on the current input
C line will be either a separator or end of line.
C    The function fails and takes the value true if the first character
C read is other than a separator or end of line. Further separators
C which might appear after the first character read can be commas, or
C blanks and tabs only if they appear before a comma; these are skipped
C if encountered. The input line decoding pointer is set immediately
C after the last valid separator; alternatively, it remains unchanged if
C an end of line was detected on the first character read, or if the
C function failed.
C    Communication with other routines is via the common block T2IPAR.
