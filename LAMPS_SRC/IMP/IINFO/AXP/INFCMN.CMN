C BUFF(80) holds one record of the History entry at a time.
C HAD_NO   flags when we're in an layer, so can't start a new one.
C HAD_NF   flags when we're in a feature, so can't start a new one.
C ELAPSED  flags which type of time to add on now for timing info.
C FOUND    flags when a FS already exists for INFO_OUT.
C COVPTR   points into the layer information arrays at the current 
C	   layer.
C LIMOV	   defines the maximum number of layers catered for by IINFO
C MAXNF    defines the maximum number of features catered for by IINFO
C FCARR    holds the feature code, the number of times features with 
C          this code occur, the number of 2 and 3-D points per feature.
C OVNOS    is a table of the layer numbers used.
C FTCNT    is a count of the number of features/layer.
C PTCNT2D  is a count of the 2-D points/layer.
C PTCNT3D  is a count of the 3-D points/layer.
C LL2D     is the 2-D line-length/layer.
C LL3D     is the 3-D line-length/layer.
C LLARR    holds the 2 and 3-D line-length/feature code
C HAD_REV   flags revision level to be output
C HAD_MH    flags map header type to be output
C HAD_BRIEF flags supress all output except revision level and map header type
