C	A simple function to evaluate the positon of a feature-code
C	in the feature-codes table.

	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNIINFO:INFCMN.CMN'

C Declarations go here
	INTEGER INDEX1
	INTEGER BOTTOM1
	INTEGER K1
C Code starts here
	FOUND = .FALSE.	! feature-code yet to be found
	K1 = 1
C Check to see if the table is empty
	IF (BOTTOM1 .EQ. 0) THEN
	   SEARCH = K1
	   GOTO 20
	END IF	 	 	
10	IF (INDEX1 .EQ. FCARR(1,K1)) THEN
	   FOUND = .TRUE.	! feature-code already present
	   SEARCH = K1
C	Feature-code not present but position for insertion evaluated
	ELSEIF (INDEX1 .LT. FCARR(1,K1) .OR. K1 .GT. BOTTOM1) 
     +     THEN
	   SEARCH = K1
	ELSE
	   K1 = K1+1	! feature-code not yet found
	   GOTO 10		! try again
	ENDIF
20	RETURN
