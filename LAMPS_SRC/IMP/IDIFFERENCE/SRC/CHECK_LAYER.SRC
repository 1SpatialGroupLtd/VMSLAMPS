***	COMMON/HERE:CMPIFF/		! our own common block

C and use the following for workspace
C
	INTEGER		I		! just for DO loops

C *********************************************************************
C clear the NF array - it has a total length of:
C
C	4 bytes/longword * NFBIG longwords/file * 2 files
C
	CALL VIOCLR( NFPOSN(1,1), 4*2*NFBIG )
C
C get the next layer number, and which files it is in
C
	CALL GETNOV(.FALSE.)
C
C if we processing according to OS protocol, we must ignore
C certain layers
C
	IF ( OS ) THEN
	   IF ( LAYER.EQ.0 .OR. LAYER.EQ.11

C
C report the layer number?
C
	IF (FULL) THEN
	   CALL FLWRTF

C
C now gather the FSN pointers for all features in this overlay
C
	DO 700 I = 1,2
C
C	 GETNOV will have set LAYER_PRESENT for whether the overlay
C	 is present in both files - note that it is present in at
C	 least one of them!
C
	   IF (LAYER_PRESENT(I)) THEN

C
C if the layer is present in both files, then we must compare it
C if it is absent from one, then we must count it as present/absent
