C IDIFFERENCE - converted from CMPIFF by TJ Ibbs, et al, Nov/Dec 1986
C (and CMPIFF was written by TJ Ibbs, 14 May 1982 sqq)
C
C IDIFFERENCE compares two IFF files, and is part of the IMP suite
C of utilities
C
C We have 2 files, and read through them first (READIN) to build
C up an array of pointers to the FSNs in each file. The mapheaders
C are also read in at this stage. We can thus compare the latter
C immediately, and then work through the FSN array in numerical
C order, comparing any features which occur in both files.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
	INCLUDE	'LSL$CMNIFF:CB.STR'	! needed for FEATUR
C
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNLSL:EXPC/		! for MAX_EXPMAX
C
***	COMMON/HERE:CMPIFF/		! for BEGIN_DIFF
***	COMMON/HERE:FILES/		! for luns, etc
***	COMMON/HERE:PARAM/		! for command line qualifiers
***	COMMON/HERE:FEATUR/		! for TEXTMAX
***	COMMON/HERE:OVRLAY/		! for DIFNOS
***	COMMON/HERE:COUNT/		! for difference counts
C
C let us call the following
C
	LOGICAL		OBEY		! interpret command line
	LOGICAL		OPEN_FILES	! guess what that does
	LOGICAL		DIFFSTART	! comapre the header entries
C
C and use the following for workspace
C
	INTEGER		FILE		! DO loop - which input file
	INTEGER		I		! DO loop - miscellaneous
C
C *********************************************************************
C initialise the LSLLIB library
C
 	CALL LSL_INIT
C
C use the largest EXPBUF we can, just in case our output lines get
C very big
C
	CALL SET_EXPMAX(MAX_EXPMAX)
C
C *********************************************************************
C define the luns for our various files
C
	DO 20 I = 1,2		! for our input IFF files
	   LUN(I) = I		! luns 1 and 2
20	CONTINUE
C
	DO 30 I = 1,3		! for our plot IFF files
	   PLOT_LUN(I) = I+2	! luns 3 to 5
30	CONTINUE
C
	OUTPUT_LUN = 6		! and for our print (output) file
C
C *********************************************************************
C now interpret the command line
C
	IF ( OBEY() ) GOTO 9999
C
C and open our various files
C
	IF ( OPEN_FILES() ) GOTO 9999
C
C are we debugging?
C
	IF (ARM.GT.0) THEN
	   CALL FLWRTF('DEBUG level %N',ARM)
      	   IF (TOFILE) CALL TTWLIN
	ENDIF
C
C *********************************************************************
C so now we have our files, all ready to use. We must leaf through them
C to find all the FSNs - but beware that we only look at the first map
C in each file - IMP does not support multiple maps in a file.
C
C - 'zeroise' the count of layers extra or missing
C
	LAYEXTR = 0		! no extra layers in file 2
	LAYMISS = 0		! no missing layers in file 2
C
C - 'zeroise' the general totals
C
	NFCFED = 0		! compared no features yet
	NFSAME = 0		! & thus none were exactly the same
	NFDIFF = 0		! none were different
	NFMISS = 0		! none were missing
	NFEXTR = 0		! none were extra
C
	NFDUPL(1) = 0		! no duplicated FSNs in file 1
	NFDUPL(2) = 0		! no duplicated FSNs in file 2
C
C - and the specific totals
C
	DIFF_FS		= 0	! FC entries
	DIFF_ACS	= 0	! AC entries
	DIFF_CB_XYZ	= 0	! CB x,y,z attributes
	DIFF_CB_ATT	= 0	! CB other attributes
	DIFF_TH    	= 0	! TH entries
	DIFF_RO		= 0	! RO entries
	DIFF_TX		= 0	! TX entries
	DIFF_TS		= 0	! TS entries
	DIFF_COMP	= 0	! text components
	DIFF_UNMATCHED	= 0	! unmatched (too many points different)
C
C and compare the starts of the two files
C - note that DIFFSTART returns TRUE if one (or both) of the files
C   is lacking an RA entry. This is considered fatal to our cause.
C
    	IF ( DIFFSTART() ) GOTO 9000
C
C sort out where the NO entries are for each file
C
	DO 600 FILE = 1,2
	   CALL NOSCAN( FILE )	! find all the NO entries
600	CONTINUE
C
C get the total number of different layers in the two maps
C
	CALL GETNOV(.TRUE.)
C
C copy the first few entries in the relevant file to the
C difference files
C
	IF (PLOT) THEN
	   DO 650 I = 1,3
 	      CALL WRPINI(I)	! add the data to the file
650	   CONTINUE
	ENDIF
C
C proceed layer by layer (DIFNOS is the number of different layer
C numbers, and is set by GETNOV)
C
	DO 900 I = 1,DIFNOS
	   CALL CHECK_LAYER
900	CONTINUE
C
C *********************************************************************
C output the summary of differences
C
5000	CALL SUMMARY
C
C plot the 'frame' overlay and end the plot file
C
	IF (PLOT) THEN
	   DO 950 I = 1,3
	      CALL WRPCLO(I)
950	   CONTINUE
	ENDIF
C
C let us close the IFF files, and exit in a tidy manner
C
9000	CALL IFFCLO( LUN(1) )
	CALL IFFCLO( LUN(2) )
C
C spool our output to the printer if necessary
C
	IF (TOLP) CALL FLWSPL( OUTPUT_LUN )
C
C and that is all, folks
C
9999	CALL LSL_EXIT
	END
