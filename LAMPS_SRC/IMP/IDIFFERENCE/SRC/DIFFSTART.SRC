C	     To implement the switch to determine whether to compare
C	     the HI, MD and NS entry
C
C This function compares the start of the two IFF files
C - that is those entries that one would normally expect
C   to find before the first NO entry
C
C It returns TRUE if we do not have a RA entry in both files,
C and should thus abandon comparison

C so compare the entries - each function will IFFRWD before looking
C for its particular entry, so the order is irrelevant to our
C comparison

C if we did not have RA entries in both files, then we should give up
C at once, otherwise we will be OK
