C to scan a feature for TS entries
C - assumes that we are already 'sitting on' a TS entry
C
C returns TRUE if we find an EF safely

C assume the best
C
	SCANTS = .TRUE.
C
C record the first TS entry's position

	TSCNT(FILE) = 1				! it's the first one
	TSPOSN( TSCNT(FILE), FILE ) = LPOSH	! position of this entry
C
C and now scan the entry
C - if we find a TS entry, log it
C - if we find an EF entry, then we have finished
C - end-of-file is treated similarly (to be consistent with GETEF, etc)

C so we have another TS
C - do we have room for it?
