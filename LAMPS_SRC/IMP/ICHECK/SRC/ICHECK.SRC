C	IMP utility to check the geometry of an IFF file. 
C
C	Checks can be made for loops in linework, touching features,
C	duplicate points, neatline (or border) intersection, and 
C	consistency with FRT.
C
C	Output can be directed to the terminal, text file, IFF plot file
C	or to a LITES2 command file.
