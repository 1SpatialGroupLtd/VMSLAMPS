C Program to read a DMA DLMS DTED (Defense Mapping Agency  
C			Digital Land Mass Simulation
C			Digital Terrain Elevation Data) mag tape and
C copy the information to a DTI (Digital Terrain Image) file on disc.
C
C A Change 2 tape will produce a UHL1 type DTI file
C while a Change 3/4 tape will produce a TED4 type DTI.
C If GRID option is used, the UHL1 type always produced.
