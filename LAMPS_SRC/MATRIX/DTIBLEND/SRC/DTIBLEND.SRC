C DTIBLEND is the MATRIX grid edge match utility. It accepts as input
C two DTI files and edgematches them to avoid discontinuities at the
C matrix joining edge. Options are provided to hold one matrix unchanged
C or to smooth both matrices to a common mean edge. An option is
C provided to read one or more IFF files containing control
C information. The edge blend is performed using simple linear
C interpolation., within a band width specified by the BORDER command.
