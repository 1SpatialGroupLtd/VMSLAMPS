C Routine to determine the minimum origin offset used in the input
C DTI files. Fix this as a local datum and then set all data relative
C to this local datum. We are then able to (hopefully) keep all the
C data in common local space using real*4's despite having global
C offsets held in real*8's.
C
C The input IFF file offsets relative to the DTI file local datum are
C placed in /PROCESS/LOCOFF by IFF_SETUP().
