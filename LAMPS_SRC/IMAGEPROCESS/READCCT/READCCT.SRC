C
C	READCCT will read a STANDARD SPOT, TM or RAE CCT.
C
C	The user may select whether the ancillary, header or
C	image data records are read.
C
C	If the option to read the image data is selected, output
C	is to a DTI mapped file.  The user may specified which
C	bands are transferred, and the start and end line and
C	sample values to enable a sub-scene to be read.
C
C	If the option to read the header and ancilliary files is
C	selected, output is to a text file.
C
C	The diagnostics option prints details on the terminal from
C	the volume, pointer and descriptor records, as well as
C	giving an indication of the progress of the different
C	tape reading operations.
