C Routine to output percentage progress messages.
C If GRAPHICS are selected put out message at INCREMENT intervals
C If CRT then keep over-writing previous message, otherwise
C put out nothing.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments
	CHARACTER*(*)	STRING		! %done message
	INTEGER		DONE		! current value
	INTEGER		TOTAL		! total value
	INTEGER		INCREMENT	! message increment
	LOGICAL		CRT		! output to CRT?
	LOGICAL		IOPT		! options:
C					 -1 = initialise
C					  0 = mid flight
C                                         1 = 100% done - clear text
C
C W/s
	INTEGER		I		! loop variable
	REAL		PCENT		! current % completion
	REAL		PCF		! conversion ratio
	REAL		LPCENT		! last % message value
	INTEGER		ICENT		! temp var
C
	SAVE		ICENT,PCF,LPCENT! saves recalculation etc.
