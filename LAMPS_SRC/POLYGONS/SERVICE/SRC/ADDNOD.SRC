C
C Routine to add a node to a junction (creating the junction and/or
C the JB entry if necessary). The address of the junction is
C returned in common block HIT (in HTPOSH,HTPOSJ). The position of
C the junction is returned in X,Y so that the segment end point
C can be adjusted.
C 
C Each element in the sector header (SH) entry points to a single
C junction block (JB) entry (or chain of JB entries) which contains
C all the junctions in that sector. Each of these junctions points
C to all the features (segments) connected to it. These pointers
C are the nodes.

C Routine used to find if this node (junction) is within the given
C tolerance. If it is then is it the closest so far?
C Called from within the IFF library routine IFJSCN which calls this
C for every junction in the sector.
C Function always returns TRUE so as to continue scanning and
C consequently find the best hit.
