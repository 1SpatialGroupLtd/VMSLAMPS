	SUBROUTINE READ_AC_TEXT(TEXT,LENGTH,IELEN)

C       MOD 1438					ST 1-Dec-1994
C       GET_SEED_LABEL does not do any checking to see if the AC text
C       string is empty so the program crashes in COPY_STRING. So if
C       we check for that here, we can give it a length of 1 and make
C       the string a single null character. IFFAC will output this as
C       an empty string. This is the simplest method as the alternative
C       is to check for the length to be zero in many many routines and
C       pass this all the way back up to OUTPUT_ACS.
