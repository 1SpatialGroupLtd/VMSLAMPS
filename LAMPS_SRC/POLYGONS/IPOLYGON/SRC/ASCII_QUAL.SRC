C Function to decode IPOLYGON/ASCII= qualifier
C
C All results are returned via /COMMAND/ 
C
C Function returns SS$_NORMAL if all is well or one of a variety of
C CLI errors on failure.

C Parameters:
	INTEGER		SS$_NORMAL
	EXTERNAL	SS$_NORMAL	! normal successful completion
	INCLUDE 	'LSL$CMNIPOLYGON:IPOLYGONMSG.PAR'

C
C W/s:
	LOGICAL		LOCAL		! tmp var
	LOGICAL		LOCNEG		! tmp var
	LOGICAL		HAD_QUAL	! qualifier was present
	LOGICAL		HAD_KEY		! keyword was present

	ASCII_QUAL=%LOC(SS$_NORMAL)
C
C Setup defaults
	OPT_ASCII = .FALSE.
	ASCII_LABEL = .FALSE.
	ASCII_IDENT = .FALSE.
C
C Is the /ASCII qualifier present?
	ASCII_QUAL=DCL_QUAL('ASCII',HAD_QUAL,LOCAL,LOCNEG,.TRUE.)
	IF (.NOT.ASCII_QUAL) GOTO 10
	IF (.NOT.HAD_QUAL) GOTO 10
C
C yes - so note there is a segment listing to be output
	OPT_ASCII = .TRUE.
C
C Are labels to be output?
	ASCII_QUAL=DCL_QUAL('ASCII.LABEL',HAD_KEY,LOCAL,LOCNEG,.TRUE.)
	IF (.NOT.ASCII_QUAL) GOTO 10
	ASCII_LABEL = HAD_KEY
C
C Are identifiers to be output?
	ASCII_QUAL=DCL_QUAL('ASCII.IDENT',HAD_KEY,LOCAL,LOCNEG,.TRUE.)
	IF (.NOT.ASCII_QUAL) GOTO 10
	ASCII_IDENT = HAD_KEY
C
C Finished....
