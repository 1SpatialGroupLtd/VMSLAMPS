C Pick up points in boxes (if any) in the range from box
C rows IA to IB, with increment of MINC, and columns JA to JB
C with increment of KINC. This routine enables a hollow
C square expansion search to be made from a given position
C by using two calls to it. The first picks up the top and
C bottom rows of boxes falling in the hollow square, and the
C second gets the remaining sides of the square of boxes.
