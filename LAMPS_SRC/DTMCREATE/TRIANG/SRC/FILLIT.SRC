C Set up the imaginary points from row IA to row IB, and column
C JA to JB, cycling through the rows and columns either forwards
C or backwards depending on the values of IDIR and JDIR (+1 =
C forwards, -1 = backwards). The X,Y location of the first point
C in the sequence is LX,LY, and the increments for the two
C coordinates are LXINC and LYINC. The first point number is to be
C NP+1 and increases by one for every point entered. The first
C point in box (ARRAY IN) is set at the same time.
