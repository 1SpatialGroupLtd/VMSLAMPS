C find the other third point (NODD) on the far side of the edge.

C......Set NODD to a value it can't possibly have
	NODD=-1
C......Pick up list of neighbours for NODA, and find the points either
C......side of NODB. The one we want is the one that is not NODC.

C......Check for case that NODA and NODB are imaginary points
	IF (NODA.GT.LIMPOL.OR.NODB.GT.LIMPOL) GOTO 10

	IF (IABS(NODA-NODB).GT.1) GOTO 10
