C Find the correct data point to delete or change. If point cannot be
C deleted or changed then return FALSE. Otherwise TRUE

C Find the correct data point to delete or change define the size in
C integer scaled units, of 5 screen units by using two calls of CONPOS
C to convert IX (the GIN location and then IX+5 to integer scaled
C units. 
10	CALL CONPOS(MCX,MCY,IX,IY)
	CALL CONPOS(J,I,IX+5,IY)
C
C Using the integer scaled version of the screen defined +/- 5 screen
C units (given by the two above CONPOS calls) it is possible to calc.
C a tolerance in integer scaled terms for point tolerance that is
C independent of the zoom situation, and relies on constant screen
C resolution. the operator (and program) will not be able to resolve
C accurately two points closer than 5 screen units. 
	ITOL=IABS(MCX-J)
C
C Find closest point (KLOSE) in the box structure
	CALL RIPPLE(MCX,MCY,KLOSE)
C
C Check this point is within ITOL units of the screen position
	IF (IABS(MCX-MAC(1,KLOSE)).GT.ITOL.OR.
     &     IABS(MCY-MAC(2,KLOSE)).GT.ITOL) THEN

     &     ('Too far from nearest node - try again')
	   CALL XHAIR(IX,IY,KEY)
	   GOTO 10

C Get its screen location
