C Read through the node/neighbour file. If IERR is -1 on entry
C clear the buffer. Set IERR to 0 on exit unless an error has
C occurred. NBUF is unused data position marker for buffer, NSIZE
C is the size of the buffer, and the buffer is NODS. N numbers
C are needed from the buffer, and should be put into NAY.
C
C Parameters:
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNTRIEDIT:TRIEDITMSG.PAR'
	INCLUDE 'LSL$DTMCREATESYS:MESPAR.PAR'
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNTRIEDIT:DIMS.PAR'
	INCLUDE '($RMSDEF)/NOLIST'

C Common:
	INCLUDE 'LSL$DTMCREATESYS:MESSAGE.CMN'
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNTRIEDIT:NODBUF.CMN'
C
	INTEGER	NAY(NTMSIZ)
C
	LOGICAL OK		! function return

C Function:
	LOGICAL RDUNF		! efficient unformatted Fortran read

C
C Check for first time command.
	IF (IERR.EQ.-1) NBUF=1
	NUM=0
C
C Is buffer empty?
10	IF (NBUF.NE.1) GOTO 20
C
C Yes, get a dollop from the binary record file
	IERR=1
	OK=RDUNF(LUN,NODS,NSIZE)
	IF (.NOT.OK) THEN
	   IF (OK.EQ.RMS$_EOF) GO TO 40	! EOF ?
	   CALL OUTOPT(' ')
	   CALL LSL_GETMSG(TRIEDIT__RDNOD,MESSAGE,MESLEN)
	   CALL OUTOPT(MESSAGE(:MESLEN))
	   CALL LSL_GETMSG(OK,MESSAGE,MESLEN)
	   J=INDEX(MESSAGE,'!') - 1		! (ignore any FAO stuff)
	   IF (J.LE.0) J=MESLEN
	   CALL ALARMS(1,0,MESSAGE(:J))		! close down & exit
	ENDIF
C
C Numbers now available, how many numbers are still required?
20	IERR=0
	K=NBUF + MIN0(N-NUM,NSIZE-NBUF+1) - 1
	DO 30 I=NBUF,K
	   NUM=NUM + 1
	   NAY(NUM)=NODS(I)
30	CONTINUE
C
C Update NBUF - marking position of first unused number in buffer
	NBUF=K + 1
	IF (NBUF.GT.NSIZE) NBUF=1
C
C Have the N numbers been supplied yet?
	IF (NUM.NE.N) GOTO 10
C
C Yes they have - all finished
C Check no zero is present - used as filler in last record
40	IF (NAY(N).EQ.0) THEN
	   CALL LSL_GETMSG(TRIEDIT__NODEOF,MESSAGE,MESLEN)
	   CALL ALARMS(1,0,MESSAGE(:MESLEN))
	ENDIF
