C TRICLP clips output to the window. IX,IY is the input point location
C in integer scaled coordinates, XYBUF the clipped (real world) coords 
C for plotting.
C It attempts to clip as speedily as possible by performing point in 
C window checks rather than line checks wherever possible. We assume
C that the node point is always inside the window. 
C
C The output from the clipper is buffered in XYBUF after real world 
C scaling.

C Point IX,IY is outside the window. We will have to calc. the 
C intersection of the line NODEX,NODEY - IX,IY with the window clipping 
C boundary.
