C Reads data from an IFF file and inserts every point found into 
C the triangulation held in memory, maintaining links between 
C each point in the same string but allowing breaks between
C strings.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments:
	INTEGER		IZOOM		! zoom level
	INTEGER		NUM		! number of points read in
C
C W/s
	INTEGER		NF(2)		! FSN and internal seq. #
	INTEGER		I		! temp var
	LOGICAL		OK		! function return
	LOGICAL		FINISHED	! .T. when IFF file read
	LOGICAL	  	NEW_FEATURE	! started new ftr or within one?
C
C Functions:
	LOGICAL		IFFBDY		! get input from IFF file
	LOGICAL		INSERT_STRING	! inserts str. into triang

C Remember how many points there were when we started
	NUM=NP
C Set up input for a maximum of 100000 strings
	DO 10 I=1,100000
	   OK=IFFBDY(FINISHED,NF,NEW_FEATURE)
	   IF (.NOT.OK) GOTO 20
C
C If we have finished, print summary and close input file. Otherwise
C process the string, inserting its data points into the box structure
	   IF (FINISHED) GOTO 30
C
C Insert points into triangulation. Function returns .F. if we try to
C insert across a zero width triangle - most probably a cliffline!
	   OK=INSERT_STRING(NF,NEW_FEATURE)
	   IF (.NOT.OK) GOTO 30
C Look for any more strings from file/keyboard
10	CONTINUE
	GOTO 30

C Calculate increase in number of points in memory after
C all the string additions have been made.
