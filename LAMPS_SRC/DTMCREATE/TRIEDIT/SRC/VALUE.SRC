C......Calculate a real value back transformed from the integer for X,
C......Y or Z. Uses RCONVI to obtain the scaling parameters. IOP = 1(X),
C......IOP = 2 (Y), IOP = 3 (Z). If a z-value is being determined then
C......use the absolute value of IX, as many z values will be negative
C......as the data set is marked -ve deliberately to show discontinuous
C......points. The X and Y coordinates might be negative as well
