C Get a string from those stored in TEXT, and put the string
C found into WORD. If IERR is -1 on input then force a read, of
C a new string sequence of words into TEXT. Otherwise
C use whatever is still present in TEXT until it is empty, when a
C read is forced again.  Error status is reported -1 = EOF, 0 = OK
C +1 = read error of some sort. LHS indicates which q/a area is being
C used - the left hand side (LHS=1), or the right hand side (LHS=0).
