C......Figplt plots a character chosen out of the range -./0123456789
C......IX,IY is the lower left corner of the character
C......KMULT is the multiplier for character size related to basic
C......plot character screen size (7 screen units for KMULT = 1 etc)
C......CA,SA are cos and sin of the rotation angle for the character
C......IC is the table entry of symbol to be plotted
