C Calculate a real VALUE back transformed from the integer for X,
C Y or Z. Uses RCONVI to obtain the scaling parameters. IOP = 1(X),
C IOP = 2 (Y), IOP = 3 (Z). If a z-value is being determined then
C use the absolute value of IX, as many z values will be negative
C as the data set is marked -ve deliberately to show discontinuous
C points. The X and Y coordinates might be negative as well
C
C This routine differs from VALUE.SRC as the X and Y offsets (VMIN()) 
C are not added to the back transformed coordinates as these are held
C in the IFF type 2 MD as the OO (Origin Offset)
