C......Determine which of the 9 possible areas a point lies within.
C......The window itself is surrounded by 8 others, each with its
C......individual number. NB: this is much more efficiently done
C......using non-standard binary codes bit handling. IX,IY is the
C......point, and the window area is defined by the corner limits
C......JSC to JFC, and JSR to JFR (stored in /CONTR/).
