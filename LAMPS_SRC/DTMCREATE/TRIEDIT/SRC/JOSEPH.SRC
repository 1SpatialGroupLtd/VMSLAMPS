C Sets the colours, linetypes and pen associations to use with
C the different object types.
C
C**************************** PEN ALLOCATION *************************
C
C......Set colours and linetypes to desired range - 7 pens are assumed.
C......the pens are assigned to drawn object types. The table below
C......shows the assignments made according to how many pens actually
C......exist in the system. It is assumed that the number of colours
C......available equals the number of pens at the workstation, and that
C......there are always five line-styles available for each pen.

C
C    Line associations are held in MAPLIN - present assumption is a
C    one - to - one relationship between desired line type and the
C    specified line type from the table above.
