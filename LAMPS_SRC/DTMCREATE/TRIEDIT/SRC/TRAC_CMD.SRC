C Triangle links can be plotted on the screen with a variable level
C of accuracy. Level 0 plota all links that have one end inside the
C window, and level 1 those links emanating from points outside the
C the window but with neighbours inside it. level 2 gives maximum
C performance with full clipping of all links traversing the
C window. Time rises dramatically in terms of calculating which
C points should be considered to be in the window, as the level
C rises.
