C Remove any entry in the data structure that may exist for
C the neighbours of NOD. First check MD(5,...) for being unset. If it
C is not set to 1 then follow all records through the structure
C until a non-negative 11th value is found, return each record to
C the stack, and unset the MD(5,...) entry. this is done by setting
C it to 1, a record number not used in the system.
