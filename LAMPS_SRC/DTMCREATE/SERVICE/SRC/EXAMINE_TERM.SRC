	LOGICAL FUNCTION EXAMINE_TERM()
C
***	MODULE	EXAMINE_TERM
***	IDENT	19NO87
C
C Function to examine SYS$OUTPUT to see if it is assigned to a terminal
C If it is we must determine whether it is a CRT or not.
C
C Commumication is via GRAFCS common block
C
C	If a terminal (i.e. not batch) /GRAFCS/ IS_TERM is set
C	If a CRT /GRAFCS/ CRT is set
C
C If our enquiries succeed return SS$_NORMAL, if not then one of a
C variety of system condition codes.
