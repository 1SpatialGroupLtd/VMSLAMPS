C Routine to output percentage progress messages.
C If GRAPHICS are selected put out message at INCREMENT intervals
C If CRT then keep over-writing previous message, otherwise
C put out nothing.

C Arguments
	CHARACTER*(*)	STRING		! %done message
	INTEGER		DONE		! current value

C					 -1 = initialise
C					  0 = mid flight
C                                         1 = 100% done - clear text
