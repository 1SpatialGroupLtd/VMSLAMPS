C This subroutine starts off the contents of a new IFF file.
C It returns FALSE if it succeeds, and TRUE if some (described)
C failure occurs
C Also opens dump file if wanted to receive hex dump of manuscript on 
C tape

 	CHARACTER*60	ACTNAM		! actual file we write to

        INTEGER         RETVAL          ! for errors

C  functions
        INTEGER         IFFCREATE

C
C we assume the worst
C
	STRTIF = .TRUE.		  ! guess an error
C
C and try to open the file
C
        RETVAL = IFFCREATE( IFFLUN, FILNAM )
C
C did an error occur?
C
        IF (.NOT.RETVAL)THEN
           CALL LSL_PUTMSG(DFAD2I__IFFILERR, FILNAM)
           CALL LSL_PUTMSG(RETVAL)
           RETURN
        ENDIF
C
C so the file is opened safely -
C tell what file we're actually writing to
C
	CALL IFFINQ(ACTNAM, ACTLEN)	! find the file name
	CALL WRITEF('Outputting manuscript %N to IFF file %S',
     &				MANNUM, ACTNAM(1:ACTLEN) )
C
C and let us rewind the file, just for safety's sake
C
	CALL IFFRWD
C
	INIFF  = .TRUE.			! in an IFF file now
	FTRONE = .TRUE.			! first feature now to come
	DONHDR = .FALSE.		! haven't called OUTHDR
C
C Now open the dump file if wanted
C
	DUMPOPN = .FALSE.
	IF (DUMP) THEN
C
C Open file for write
C
	   RETVAL = FLWOPN (DUMPLUN,DUMPFILE(:DUMPLEN))
C
C Check for errors
C
	   IF (.NOT.RETVAL)THEN
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG(DFAD2I__DUMPFILERR, DUMPFILE(:DUMPLEN))
	      CALL LSL_PUTMSG(RETVAL)
	      RETURN
	   ENDIF
C
C Tell the user about dump file
C
	   CALL WRITEF('Dumping manuscript %N to file %S',
     &				MANNUM, DUMPFILE(1:DUMPLEN) )
	ENDIF
C
C Set flag to indicate it is open
C
        DUMPOPN = .TRUE.
C
C Exit
C
	STRTIF = .FALSE.		! success
	RETURN				! back to the main program
	END
