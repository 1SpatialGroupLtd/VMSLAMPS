C Author TJ Ibbs,     21 March 1983
C MOD    D R Catlow   03 June  1988  To remove AC trailing spaces
C MOD    P Pan,	      10 May   1990 
C
C To output the AC for a feature - this defines the data which
C otherwise has no obvious place in an IFF file
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
***	COMMON/HERE:SCRIPT/	! manuscript details
***	COMMON/HERE:DESCR/	! feature description
***	COMMON/HERE:PARAMS/	! for DIAG_FULL
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNLSL:EXPC/	! string construction
C
C now we want to define our AC, with all that information we can't
C get in anywhere else
C
C the first part is the same for all features...
C
C start with the common part
C
	CALL EXPAND('typ%I1 hgt%I5 fid%I4 sec%I2 rel%I2 smc%I2',
     &			FTYPE, HEIGHT, FID, SECRTY, RELEAS, SURFAM)
C
C and now we deal with the individual cases
C
	IF ( FTYPE.EQ.0 ) THEN		! point feature
C
	   CALL APPEND(' wid%I3 lth%I3 ori%I2',WIDTH,LENGTH,ORIENT)
C
	ELSE IF ( FTYPE.EQ.1 ) THEN	! line feature
C
	   CALL APPEND(' wid%I3 dir %I1',WIDTH,DIRECT)
C
	ELSE				! area feature
C
	   CALL APPEND(' den%I2 rof%I3 tre%I3',DENSTY,ROOF,TREE)
C
	ENDIF
C
C
	IF ( DIAG_FULL ) CALL TTWLIN ! to terminal too
C
C and now the AC itself - type FADTAC, code unset, text as above
C
	CALL IFFAC( FADTAC, 0, EXPBUF )
C
	RETURN
C
	END
