C Function to attempt to delete FADT record with specified FAC in
C FADT file on LUN.
C Will first attempt to read record, and if it exists, will DELETE it.
C Returns .TRUE. if succeeds.
C Returns .FALSE. if fails, e.g. if no such record

C arguments
	INTEGER*2	FAC	! FAC of record for deletion

C
C w/s variables
