C SELective IFFNXT subroutine to read next entry from current
C IFF file which is not one of the entries to be skipped by
C FADTMERGE. These entries are :
C	Junction Structures (SH, JB, JP)
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C arguments
	INTEGER*2	CODE
	INTEGER*2	LEN
C
C Next entry in current iff file (which will have been selected
C by calling routine)
C
10	CALL IFFNXT(CODE,LEN)
C
C Check it is not end of file - return if it is
C
	IF (LEN.NE.-1) GOTO 20
C
C Loop again if it is one of the values to be skipped
C
C Junction structures (SH,JB,JP)
C
	IF ((CODE.EQ.'SH').OR.(CODE.EQ.'JB').OR.(CODE.EQ.'JP')) GOTO 10
