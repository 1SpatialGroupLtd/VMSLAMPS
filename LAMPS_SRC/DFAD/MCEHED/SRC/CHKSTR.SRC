C To check that a string is not too long, and that there is not rubbish
C written after it
C
C We return TRUE if it is all right, FALSE if it is not
C
C (BEWARE - this is against the standard LSL standard)
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C
C we were passsed
C
	INTEGER*4	LENGTH	! the maximum length allowed
C
C we need common to get at the string length
C
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNLSL:CMDCOM.CMN'
C
C we call
C
	LOGICAL		RDCHS	! read the next significant char
C
C and we thus need
C
	BYTE		CHAR	! to hold the character
C
C
C assume failure
C
	CHKSTR = .FALSE.
C
C now check if there is more on the line...
C
	IF ( .NOT.RDCHS(CHAR) ) THEN
	   CALL WRITEF('*** ERROR *** '//
     &			'Unexpected "%A1" found after string',CHAR)
	   RETURN
	ENDIF

C
	IF ( STARLE.GT.LENGTH ) THEN
	   CALL WRITEF('*** ERROR *** '//
     &			'String should be %N chars - %^W%N is too many',
     &				 	 LENGTH,    STARLE )
	ELSE
	   CHKSTR = .TRUE.		! success - a legal length
	ENDIF
