C This subroutine takes the pseudo-string from /CMDCOM/ and copies
C it into the byte buffer TO, which has maximum length LENGTH
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C we were passed
C
	INTEGER		TO	! just passing through
	INTEGER		LENGTH	! length of required string
C
C we also need common
C
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNLSL:CMDCOM.CMN'	! for STARST, etc
C
C and we need the basis for our own pseudo-string
C
	INTEGER*4	PSDSTR(2)
C
C and set it up as a string
C
	PSDSTR(2) = %LOC( TO )
	PSDSTR(1) = LENGTH
C
C and now do the copy
C
	CALL STRCPY( STARST, PSDSTR )
C
	RETURN
	END
