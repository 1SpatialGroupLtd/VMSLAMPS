C
C This function extracts an integer from the current input buffer,
C prompting if necessary, and will update WHERE if it finds something
C sensible
C
C It returns TRUE if we update the value, FALSE otherwise
C
C we were passed
C n.b. WHERE may well be an INTEGER*4 or a BYTE
C
	INTEGER*4	CMD	! tells PROMPT which integer this is
	INTEGER*4	MIN	! minimum value allowed
	INTEGER*4	MAX	! maximum value allowed
	BYTE		WHERE(4)	! our result goes into here
	LOGICAL		LONG	! is WHERE I*4 or BYTE?
C
C the following functions are used
C
	LOGICAL		RDCHS	! read next significant char
	LOGICAL		PROMPT	! prompt for an argument
	LOGICAL		RDLONG	! read the integer
	LOGICAL		CHKINT	! check it's in range
	LOGICAL		UNSET	! see if they commanded us to unset it
C
C we also need
C
	INTEGER		I	! loop counter
	INTEGER		NBYT	! number of bytes
	BYTE		CHAR	! character read by RDCHS
	LOGICAL		REPROM	! should we reprompt?
	INTEGER*4	NUMBER	! to read the number into
	BYTE		NUMBYT(4)	! byte equivalent
	EQUIVALENCE	( NUMBER, NUMBYT )
C
C assume we fail to do the update
C
	EXTINT = .FALSE.
C
C initially, only prompt if need to
C
	REPROM = .FALSE.
C
C do we already have an argument?
C
10	IF ( REPROM .OR. RDCHS(CHAR) ) THEN	! no argument, prompt
	   IF ( PROMPT(CMD,.TRUE.) ) RETURN	! no reply
	ELSE
	   CALL BSCH			! else unread the char
	ENDIF
C
C now reprompt on an error
C
	REPROM = .TRUE.
C
C first, let us see if they have asked us to UNSET this variable
C
	IF ( UNSET() ) THEN			! yes, they did
	   IF ( .NOT.RDCHS(CHAR) ) THEN
	      CALL WRITEF('*** ERROR *** '//
     &			'Unexpected "%A1" found after unset command',
     &					CHAR )
	      GOTO 10
	   ELSE
	      CALL WRITEF('Integer field now unset')
	      NUMBER = 0			! equivalent to zero
	   ENDIF
C
	ELSE
C
C	 but no, not UNSET, so let's see if it is a valid integer
C
	   IF ( RDLONG(NUMBER) ) THEN		! failed to read it
	      CALL TTWSTR('*** ERROR *** Number expected' )
	      GOTO 10
	   ENDIF
C
C   is there anything extraneous after the number?
C
	   IF ( .NOT.RDCHS(CHAR) ) THEN
	      CALL WRITEF('*** ERROR *** '//
     &			'Unexpected "%A1" found after number',
     &						CHAR )
	      GOTO 10
	   ENDIF
C
C	 but here, it was valid - is it in range?
C
	   IF ( .NOT.CHKINT(MIN,MAX,NUMBER) ) THEN	! out of range
	      CALL TTWSTR( '*** ERROR *** Number out of range' )
	      GOTO 10
	   ENDIF
	ENDIF
C
	IF (LONG) THEN
	   NBYT=4
	ELSE
	   NBYT=1
	ENDIF
C
	DO 20 I=1,NBYT
	   WHERE(I) = NUMBYT(I)
20	CONTINUE
C
	EXTINT = .TRUE.
	RETURN
C
	END
