C Code starts here
C All 36 bit quantities have been made positive, but this routine 
C called if and only if they were really negative. Therefore all that
C needs be done is to complement each 1/2 word.
C
	DFABUF(DFAPTR) = NOT(DFABUF(DFAPTR))
	DFABUF(DFAPTR+1) = NOT(DFABUF(DFAPTR+1))
C
C ...and now reduce them to 18 bits again
C
	DFABUF(DFAPTR) = DFABUF(DFAPTR) .AND. '3FFFF'X
	DFABUF(DFAPTR+1) = DFABUF(DFAPTR+1) .AND. '3FFFF'X
C
C ...and that believe it or not is the end of the affair

	RETURN
