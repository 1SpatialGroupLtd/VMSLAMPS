C This subroutine starts off the contents of a new IFF file.
C It returns FALSE if it succeeds, and TRUE if some (described)
C failure occurs
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C common blocks...
C
***	COMMON/HERE:IFFILE/		! contains file details
C	COMMON/LSL$CMNDLMS:PARAMS/	! 
***	COMMON/HERE:I2DFADMSG.PAR/	! for messages
***	COMMON/HERE:STATE/		! for INIFF
***	COMMON/LSL$CMNIFF:IFFHAN/	! for error returns from IFF
C
C w/s variables
	INTEGER		OK		! for return codes
C
C functions
	INTEGER		IFFOPEN
C
C we assume the worst
C
	STRTIF = .TRUE.			! guess an error
C
C and try to open the file
C
	OK = IFFOPEN( IFFLUN, FILNAM(:FILLEN), ,.TRUE.)
C
C did an error occur?
C
	IF (.NOT.OK) THEN
	   CALL LSL_PUTMSG(I2D__UNOPNIFF,FILNAM(:FILLEN))
	   RETURN
	ENDIF
C
C so the file is opened safely -
C find what file we're actually writing to
C
	CALL IFFINQ(ACTNAM, ACTLEN)	! find the file name
C
C and let us rewind the file, just for safety's sake
C
	CALL IFFRWD
C
C Set flags to indicate the current state of affairs
C ie newly opened iff file
C
	INIFF  = .TRUE.			! in an IFF file now
	FTRONE = .TRUE.			! first feature now to come
	STRTIF = .FALSE.		! success
C
	RETURN				! back to the main program
	END
