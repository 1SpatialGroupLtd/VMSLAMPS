C returns TRUE if it fails to find Attribute name NAME in the ACD,
C If function fails and the optional argument RET is absent, then
C the routine produces its own (LSLLIB) error messages.
C If RET is present, then no messages are produced, and an LSLLIB message
C is returned in RET,
C otherwise the attributes of AC are set up in COMMON/FRTACD/.
