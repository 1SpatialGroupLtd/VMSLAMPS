C Routine which calls either SRIGDP or TRI_EXTENT, depending on whether 
C the given symbol/character component is to be plotted or used to 
C determine the coordinate extent.

	INTEGER		N		! number of coords
	REAL		LINE_X(*)	! X coordinates
	REAL		LINE_Y(*)	! Y coordinates
	REAL		LINE_Z(*)	! Z coordinates
	EXTERNAL	SRIGDP		! passed routine
