C Communicate GKS workstation nominal linewidth to FRTLIB.
C Routine must be called before any plotting of texts or symbols
C is done, to enable the line thickness to be set correctly.
C The argument, WIDTH, is the number of width units in the
C FRT file (SCTWID) to correspond to the device nominal line width.
C i.e. FRTLIB sets width by a call to GSLWSC( SCTWID/WIDTH )
