; IFFLIB transfer vector
;
; The order of the entries in this transfer vector must remain unchanged
; if the new shareable image is to be useable by programs which were
; linked with the old version. New additions should be made at the end.
; If new additions push the size over a page boundary, then the .ERROR
; will fail and the positions of the common blocks (which follow in the
; image) will change, so another page should be reserved, and the major
; id. of the GSMATCH link option incremented, to prevent use of the new
; image by old programs.
