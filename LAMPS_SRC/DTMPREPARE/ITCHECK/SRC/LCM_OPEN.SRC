C
C Modified from LCM_OPEN from LSL$SOURCE_ROOT:[LSLMAINT.LSLLIB.LSLDCL]
C Mod require to comment out call to DCL_CML and set CMDSTR to '$ ITCHECK '
C This function used in module ITCHECK only.
C
C Function to create a standard IMP pattern LITES2 command file.
C
C Function returns:
C
C		LSL__NORMAL     - all is well
C
C or one of a variety of CLI or LSLLIB errors on failure
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments:
	INTEGER*2	LUN	! the LUN of the output file
	CHARACTER*(*)	FILESPEC! the log file specification
	REAL		DRANGE(4)! the data range
	LOGICAL		HAD_LOG ! /LOG specified?
C
C Parameters:
	INCLUDE '($SSDEF)'
	INCLUDE 'LSL$CMNLSL:LSLLIBMSG.PAR'
C
C Workspace:
	CHARACTER*1024	CMDSTR	! the command line to be printed out
