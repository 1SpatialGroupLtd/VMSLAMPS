C Vector terrain error checking program.
C
C The ITCHECK is command driven program.  The utility will allow a number 
C of checks to be performed on up to five IFF input files at any one time.
C 
C A brief description of each of the available is given as follows:-
C
C CHECK 1
C =======
C 1.	Supplementary contour heights are divisible by the supplementary
C	contour interval. 
C 2.	Contour heights are divisible by the contour interval. 
C 3.	Index contour heights are divisible by the index contour interval. 
C 4.	Heights lie within a specified range.
C 5.	Contour values between upper and lower range limits are present.
C 6.	Coastline items have zero height.
C 7.	Index contour values between upper and lower limits are present.
C
C CHECK 2
C =======
C 1.	No item cross or lie outside the rectangular map border as defined
C       by the corner points (CP) entry.  User can specify own boundary to
C       to be used in place of CP entry by using the BORDER command.
C 2.	Correct contour, lake and island closure if loop lines.
C 3.	Unconnected items.
C 4.	Linking items with height mismatch.
C 5.	Items linking to too many items.
C
C CHECK 3
C =======
C 1.	Touching or crossing features.
C
C CHECK 4
C =======
C 1.	Validity of line item heights with that of neighbouring items.
C
C CHECK 5
C =======
C 1.	Start and end vectors of loop lines do not cross.
C 2.	Line items to do not contain internal loops.
C 3.	Duplicated points (double-digitising).
C 4.	Shot heights only have 1 coordinate ST,ZS or CB entry.
C
C CHECK 6
C =======
C 1.	Spot heights and neighbouring contour height values are valid
