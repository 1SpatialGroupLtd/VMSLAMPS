C This routine is required by LSLLIB QUICK_SORT
C
C Function to compare two elements in array TABLE.  The array really
C has MNX_ATTRIBS dimensions (givin in CONTROL.CMN), but is treated as
C one dimensional within this routine. The multidimensional array is to
C be sorted so that the values in the highest dimension end up
C increasing. The indices of the values to be compared can be calculated
C from the indices given.
