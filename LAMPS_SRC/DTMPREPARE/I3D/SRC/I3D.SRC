C 	Description: River and ridge line heighting program.
C
C	Heights river and/or ridge line features.  This is achieved
C	by finding the points where available terrain data (eg.
C	contours, spot heights) intersect each river/ridgeline, and
C	then interpolating heights between these points.
C	River/ridgeline free ends are either heighted interactively,
C	permitting the river/ridgelines to be interpolated along
C	their full length, or else these free ends are clipped off. 
C 
C	The I3D program is driven by prompt-response commands, for
C	the sake of compatibility with the rest of the DTMPREPARE
C	package.
