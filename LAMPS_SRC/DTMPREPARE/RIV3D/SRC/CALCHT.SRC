C	descr'n	: The routine given three points interpolates the hgt of 
C		  the centre point ie two ip's and the node in the form 
C		  ip-node-ip physically and the node hgt will be calc'd
C		 
	IMPLICIT NONE

C	Argumts	:
C
	INTEGER		CONNODE		!Node that hgt is being calc'd for
	REAL		URIVIP(3)	!X,Y,Z of up river ip
	REAL		DRIVIP(3)	!X,Y,Z of up river ip

	REAL		HGT		!Interpolated hgt for connode
C	See if height already been calc'd

C	Calculate the dist from node too upper ip
C
	DX = URIVIP(1) - NODE(1,CONNODE)
	DY = URIVIP(2) - NODE(2,CONNODE)
	UPLEN = SQRT(DX**2 + DY**2)
C
C	Calculate the distance from node to lower ip
C
	DX = DRIVIP(1) - NODE(1,CONNODE)
	DY = DRIVIP(2) - NODE(2,CONNODE)
	DNLEN = SQRT(DX**2 + DY**2)
C
C	Find node hgt by interpolation
C
	HGT = 
     &  ((URIVIP(3) * DNLEN + DRIVIP(3) * UPLEN) / (UPLEN + DNLEN))
	IF (NODE(3,CONNODE) .NE. -1) THEN
C
C	   Node hgt has been previously calculated so average
C
	   NODE(3,CONNODE) = (NODE(3,CONNODE) + HGT) / 2
	ELSE
C
C	   store the node hgt
C
	   NODE(3,CONNODE) = HGT
