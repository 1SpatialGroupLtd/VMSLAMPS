C	descr'n	: The routine given three points interpolates the hgt of 
C		  the centre point ie two ip's and the node in the form 
C		  ip-node-ip physically and the node hgt will be calc'd

	IMPLICIT NONE

C	Argumts	:

	INTEGER		CONNODE		!Node that hgt is being calc'd for
	REAL		URIVIP(3)	!X,Y,Z of up river ip
	REAL		DRIVIP(3)	!X,Y,Z of up river ip

	REAL		HGT		!Interpolated hgt for connode
C	See if height already been calc'd

C	Calculate the dist from node too upper ip

C	Calculate the distance from node to lower ip

	DNLEN = SQRT(DX**2 + DY**2)
C
C	Find node hgt by interpolation
C
	HGT =

C
C	   Node hgt has been previously calculated so average
C
	   NODE(3,CONNODE) = (NODE(3,CONNODE) + HGT) / 2

C	   store the node hgt
