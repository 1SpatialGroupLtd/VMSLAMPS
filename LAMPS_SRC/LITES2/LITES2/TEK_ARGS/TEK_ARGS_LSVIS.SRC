C LITES2 GKS level routine
C Set visibility of segment
C
C Expect to be called:
C (a) to set the currently open segment invisible (before putting
C     any primitives in it) when constructing a limbo item, or
C (b) to set a non-open segment invisible (deleting),
C     or visible (recovering).
