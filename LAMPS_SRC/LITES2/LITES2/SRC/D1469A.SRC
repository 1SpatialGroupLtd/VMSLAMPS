C
C Recompute point of closure on squared figure/part figure
C 1) Copy coeffs from line array entry for first line segment in
C    feature/subunit
C 2) Compute meeting point of first and last line segments
C    in feature/subunit
C 3) Copy co-ordinates of meeting point back to work area (overlaying
C    last point input)
