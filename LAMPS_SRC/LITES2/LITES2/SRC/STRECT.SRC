C set up array of attributes for ADDPTS to use
C This uses the set of point attributes that were set when the last
C point was digitised
	CALL LSTARR(CONDEF,CONATT,COATTC,COATTV,.FALSE.)
C
C add those attributes that are set up for squared point, or
C "other"
	OPER = DEFINITION(P_SQUARE)
	IF (OPER.EQ.0) OPER = DEFINITION(P_OTHER)
	CALL LSTARR(OPER,CONATT,COATTC,COATTV,.TRUE.)
C
C Main loop (for output position of each point)
	DO 20 I=1,5
	   IF (COEFFS_DEF) THEN
C calculate corresponding Z
	      CALL PLANE_INTERPL(TEMPXY(1,I),COEFFS,TEMPZ)
C
C add it to list of attributes
