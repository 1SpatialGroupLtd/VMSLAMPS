C Local Variables
	INTEGER		GT		! graphical type

C Get the graphical type of the construction (to save typing !) and the

C Check that the sequence of commands is valid; sequence
C CUR INV is invalid, and so the check is against the previous
C point which should not be a curve. Note that this point
C is not necessarily the last digitised, as the user may have removed
C some points during construction.
