C Description
C
C routine to edit control point.
C map and X and Y values to use are in CMN:DOUT
C
C Note: values in common block are updated, and the values written
C back into the file. This is done for each point. Perhaps the writing
C back to file could be postponed until the file is written out or
C dumped
