C To add a pack and a end of feature pointer to a list of these things.
C NOTE:a CTXD is only used for convenience.

C check that pack is not already on list

C is this the same feature as we are trying to add?
	IF (PACK(PAKPNF).EQ.TMPPAK(PAKPNF).AND.
     &	    PACK(PAKMAP).EQ.TMPPAK(PAKMAP)) GOTO 1000
C
C look at next one
	IF (ADDR.NE.PACKCTXD(CTXD_LSTCTX)) THEN
	   CALL PUTLNG(%VAL(ADDR+CTX_O_NXTPTR),ADDR)
	   GOTO 10
	ENDIF
C
C add this pack to list
