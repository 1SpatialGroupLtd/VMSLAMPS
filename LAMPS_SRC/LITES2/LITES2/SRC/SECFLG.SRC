C Description
C
C    This subroutine is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to check that the user flags for the current secondary
C command have been correctly specified in the command table.
C    The argument received is an integer with individual bits set
C according to the extra arguments required for the primary command.
C This value is replaced by a similar one for the secondary
C command, if the function succeeds.
