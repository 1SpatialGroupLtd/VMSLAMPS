C Description
C
C	LITES2 cartographic editor OVERLAY SELECT IMAGES command.
C
C	Bitmaps are used, even although they are so small, so 
C	that existing routines can be used to read and output the
C	required ranges.

	IMPLICIT NONE

***     COMMON/CMN:DOUT/		! command decoding output
***     COMMON/CMN:IMAGE/		! data about images
***     COMMON/CMN:OVERLAY/		! data about overlays

C Arguments
	LOGICAL		S		! select or deselect
	LOGICAL*1	SEL(MAXIMAGE)	! true if image selected

C Functions called

C Local Variables
	INTEGER*4	IMAGEMAX		 ! maximum no of words

C
C Clear SELBUF
