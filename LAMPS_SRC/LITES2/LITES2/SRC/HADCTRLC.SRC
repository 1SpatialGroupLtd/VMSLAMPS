C CTRLC_BREAK is a less severe CTRL/C which we just ignore and clear.
C Function HADBREAK is used to test for it if required.

	HADCTRLC = (CTRLC.NE.CTRLC_OFF .AND. CTRLC.NE.CTRLC_BREAK)
	IF (HADCTRLC) THEN
	   IF (CTRLC.EQ.CTRLC_AST) THEN
	      IF (CTRLC_MESS_LEN.EQ.0) THEN
	         CALL INFORM(MSG_CTRLC,'by CTRLC')
	      ELSE
	         CALL INFORM(MSG_CTRLC,' ')
	         CALL INFORM(MSG_STRING,CTRLC_MESS(:CTRLC_MESS_LEN))
	      ENDIF

C clear things, including break this time
	IF (CTRLC.NE.CTRLC_OFF) THEN
