C Created by Alan Wylie 5-Feb-1980
C From the Ordnance Survey CORAL66 squaring program
C
C Check and compute coefficients for short line segments,and compute
C direction sine and cosine for other segments.
C 1) Compute length of line segments and store in current entry of
C    line array.
C 2) If line length < specified limit,compute coefficients (A1,A2) 
C    of the homogenous line equation,store in current entry of 
C    line array, set STATUS in that entry to indicate "no futher
C    adjustments to coefficients".
C 3) If invisible then treat as short
C
C   Otherwise compute direction sine and cosine of current segment.
