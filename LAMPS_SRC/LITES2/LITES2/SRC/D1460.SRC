C
***	MODULE	D1460
***	IDENT	07MR85
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Created by Alan Wylie 5-Feb-1980
C From the Ordnance Survey CORAL66 squaring program
C	don't exit if too few points	PGH	10-Jun-1982
C	ammended for LITES@		RWR	 7-Mar-l985
C
C Clear stores and prepare for squaring
C 1) If <3 or >256 digitised points are input, print error report and
C    abandon process.
C 2) Otherwise clear registers for:-
C	maximum line length
C	sum of linear misalignments
C	temporary work area pointer
C	sum of line lengths
C    Clear line array
C    Store squaring tolerance parameter
C    Call D1461 to sift out invisible line segments
C TOLER is the squaring tolerance
C SQL is the limit for line lengths
C DCLPAR is like SQL, but applies only to Datum correction
