C Description
C
C    This subroutine is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to check that the command just read is valid in the current
C state.
C    The argument is a longword which has various bits set according to
C the states in which the current command is valid. The current state
C mask has a single bit set according to the current state, and it is
C found in the common block of state variables. The state mask is used
C with the function argument in a bitwise 'AND' operation to ascertain
C whether or not the command is valid. If the result is invalid, the
C appropriate error message is output.
