C Description
C
C    This function is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to get to the start of the next command or macro.
C    The arguments returned are the address of the current buffer, the
C length of the buffer, a pointer to the current decoding position
C on the line, a flag indicating whether or not the buffer came from
C a command file, the argument string length and the string itself.
C    The function returns true if the end of line is reached.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
***     COMMON/CMN:DVAR/		! command decoding variables
***     COMMON/CMN:GLOBAL/		! global variables
C
C Arguments
	INTEGER*4	NXTADR		! buffer address
	INTEGER*4	NXTCHS		! buffer length
	INTEGER*2	NXTPTR		! buffer decode pointer
	INTEGER*4	NXTFIL		! buffer from command file ?
	INTEGER*4	NXTARGL		! argument string length
	CHARACTER*(*)	NXTARG		! argument string
C
C Functions
	LOGICAL		SKIP		! skips command terminators
	LOGICAL		EMPSTK		! empty stack ?
C
C Local Variables
	LOGICAL		EOLN		! end of line ?
C
C Skip trailing terminators on current line
C
	EOLN = SKIP()
C
C Skip trailing terminators at lower levels, until either another
C command is found or the end of the terminal or command file input line
C is reached

	   CALL DCPSET(NXTPTR)			! set decode pointer
	   EOLN = SKIP()			! skip trailing term's
	ENDIF
	GO TO 100				! back for test
