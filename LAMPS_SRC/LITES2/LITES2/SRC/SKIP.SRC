C Description
C
C    This function is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to read and skip command terminators. Valid terminators are
C hashes, and several of these, together with spaces and tabs, are
C allowed in succession.
C    The function takes the value true if an end of line is encountered,
C and false otherwise. On exit, the command line decoding pointer is set
C either immediately after the last terminator before the next command,
C or at the end of the line.
