C Description
C
C	Routine to get the address of an entry point in an external
C	routine (if present).

C
C arguments
	CHARACTER*(*)	LOG		! logical name that points
					! to shared image
	CHARACTER*(*)	ENTRY_POINT	! entry point in shared image
	INTEGER		ADDRESS		! address of entry point;
					! = 0 if image not mapped
	CHARACTER*(*)	ERRMSG		! use routine is to be put to
					! (for error message)
	LOGICAL		WHINGE		! complain if key not found

C functions called

	INTEGER*4	TRNALL
C
C Local Variables
C
	INTEGER*4	CONTEXT		! context for LIB$FIND_FILE
	INTEGER*4	IERR		! error code
	CHARACTER*(1)	TEMP		! file specification

C
	ADDRESS = 0			! assume no routine
C
C check if logical name has been set up. If it has not, don't do
C anything, otherwise signal any error
	IF (TRNALL(LOG,TEMP).EQ.SS$_NOLOGNAM) GOTO 999
C
C Check whether file exists first
C (use same default as LIB$FIND_IMAGE_SYMBOL)

	IERR = LIB$FIND_FILE(
