C Description
C
C    This function is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to return a macro number.
C    The arguments received are the macro command number, and the menu
C or puck macro argument. For macros other than menu boxes or puck
C buttons, the second argument can be any convenient dummy value. The
C argument returned is the macro number.
C    On success, the function returns zero, and on failure, one of the
C error codes defined in the file of macro error constants.
