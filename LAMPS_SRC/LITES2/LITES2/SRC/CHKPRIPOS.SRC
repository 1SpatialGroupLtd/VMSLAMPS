C
C only deal with devices 2,4 and 6 (bitpad, ball/mouse and DSR)

	   ENDIF
   10	CONTINUE
C
   20	CONTINUE
C
C set default values of POS
	IF (DEV.EQ.2.OR.DEV.EQ.4) THEN		! bitpad and mouse
	   POS = .FALSE.
	ELSEIF (DEV.EQ.6) THEN			! DSR
	   POS = .TRUE.
	ENDIF
C
C if puck has not been set up, then don't check further
	IF (PUCK.EQ.0) GOTO 999
C
C has default action been altered?
	IF (.NOT.PUKALT(PUCK)) GOTO 999
C
C set POS according to this button number
	POS = LIB$EXTV(PUKBAS(PUCK)-MAXUSR+BUTTON,1,%VAL(PUKPOS_ADDR))
