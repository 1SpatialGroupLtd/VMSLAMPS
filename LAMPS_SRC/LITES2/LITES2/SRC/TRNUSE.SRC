C For most TRANSs this routine computes a transformation 
C for the fuctions
C		X=a0 + a1*x + a2*y + a3*x*y
C		Y=b0 + b1*x + b2*y + b3*x*y
C
C The coeficients a0, a1,a2, a3, b0, b1, b2 and b3 are in
C the array CPCOEF
C
C For TRANS = TRNTYP_PROJECTIVE , then the projective
C transformation is being used

	IMPLICIT	NONE

C arguments (input and output)
	REAL		X,Y		! coords to transform

	REAL*8		CPCOEF(4,2)	! transformation paramaters
	INTEGER		TRANS		! type of transformation

C ... X & Y contain the coord to be transformed.
C ... CPCOEF contains the transform matrix
