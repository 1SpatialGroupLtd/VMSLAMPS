C Arguments
C
	INTEGER*4	NPTS		! number of points
	REAL		XY(2,NPTS)	! line string
	LOGICAL*1	DRAW		! draw line on screen ?
	REAL		Z(NPTS)		! z value of points
C
C Local Variables
	INTEGER*4	I		! counter
C
C remember first point that filtering outputs
	IF (CHFILT.AND..NOT.GOT_FILT_FST) THEN
	   FILTFST(1) = XY(1,1)	
	   FILTFST(2) = XY(2,1)

	ENDIF
C
C Check if line is to be drawn on screen or added to the output item
	IF (DRAW) THEN
	   CALL STDBFA(NPTS,XY,Z)		! buffer the string
	ELSE
	   DO 10 I=1,NPTS
C
C add point to output item, using point attribute in CSTRCT common block
