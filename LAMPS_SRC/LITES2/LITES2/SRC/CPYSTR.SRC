C Description
C
C    This function is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to copy a character variable to another one. This allows
C copying from/to a fake character variable (which is actually an
C integer).
C    The source and destination arguments can be litteral strings, fake
C descriptors or Fortran CHARACTER variables. The destination argument
C will be padded with spaces. The function itself takes the value of the
C length the of source string including any leading or trailing spaces
C or tabs which were in that string.
