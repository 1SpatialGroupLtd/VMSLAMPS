C Description
C
C    This function is part of LITES2, and its purpose is to work out
C the vector for the line segment following the current vertex on the 
C current found feature.
C    The first argument returned consists of the differences in X and Y
C for the line segment, while the second is the current vertex number.
C    The function returns true if the vector is zero, i.e. the points
C comprising the line segment are equal.

C Calculate differences in X and Y for the segment from the current
C vertex to the next one.
