C Description
C
C	Subroutine that returns the distance along a feature that a
C	mismatch has to propogate along.
C	This is the length of the feature, or the maximum propogat
C	distance, whichever is the smaller.
C	It also returns the total length of the feature and the coords of
C	the first and last point.
