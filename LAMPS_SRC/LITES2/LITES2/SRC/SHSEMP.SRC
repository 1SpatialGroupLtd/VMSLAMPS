C	Copyright Laser-Scan Laboratories Ltd., Cambridge, England.
C
C	Created					RWR	 7-Nov-1984
C
C	This subroutine shows the currently selected maps.  It
C	does this by creating a bit map of the current selections
C	and using the subroutine DISPLBTMP to display it.
C	Argument N is 0 for global selections, or is a
C	display overlay number
C
C	Note that the user thinks that maps start at No 1, while we
C	know that they start at No 0.
