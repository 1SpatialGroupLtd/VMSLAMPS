C Description
C
C	Subroutine to carry out orthogonal transformation.  Given
C	two points on both systems, A and B are computed such that
C	X=Ax-By+C1
C	Y=Bx+Ay+C2
C
	IMPLICIT	NONE
C
C arguments (input)
C
	REAL	OLD1(2),OLD2(2)	! points in first system
	REAL	NEW1(2),NEW2(2)	! same points in new system
C
C (output)
C
	REAL	A,B,C1,C2
C
C Local Variables
C
	REAL	DX,DY,DXN,DYN,DEN
C
C reduce to common origin, and work out transformation there
C
	DX =OLD2(1)-OLD1(1)
	DY =OLD2(2)-OLD1(2)
	DXN=NEW2(1)-NEW1(1)
	DYN=NEW2(2)-NEW1(2)
C
	DEN=DX**2+DY**2
C
	IF (DEN.EQ.0.0) THEN
	   A=0.0
	   B=0.0
	ELSE
	   A=(DX*DXN+DY*DYN)/DEN
	   B=(DX*DYN-DY*DXN)/DEN
	ENDIF
C
C now work out constants
C
	C1=-A*OLD1(1)+B*OLD1(2)+NEW1(1)
	C2=-B*OLD1(1)-A*OLD1(2)+NEW1(2)
C
	RETURN
	END
