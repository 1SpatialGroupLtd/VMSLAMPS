C
C check that feature code has been set up, and that it is a text

	PACK(PAKFC) = CONTFC
C
C Is the graphical type text
	IF (.NOT.FRTTEX) THEN
	   CALL MOAN(MSG_FCNOTTEXT,CONTFC)
	   CALL LEARN(MSG_SETTEXT)
	   GOTO 999
	ENDIF
C
C set up TXSIZE, from values in attribute set
	CALL SETTH(TXSIZE,-1,I)			! use I as dummy
C
C Set up an FS entry	( only FS(3) is used by GENAUX)
	FS(1) = CONTFC
	FS(2) = 0

C now call GENAUX to get AUX set up
