C    This subroutine is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to diagnose macro name reading errors and output
C appropriate messages. 
C    The arguments received are the return code from the routine which
C reads the macro name, and one of the strings 'macro' or 'menu name'.
C Where errors have to be treated in a different way, or alternative
C messages output, the return code should be tested before entry to this
C subroutine. Error associated with the decoding of secondary commands
C have not been handled, as they should never occur.
