C Description
C
C    This subroutine is part of the LITES2 Command Interface, and its
C purpose is to find the extra argument type.
C    The argument received is a long word containing te extra arguments
C which have not yet been dealt with. The subroutine checks this word
C bit by bit until a bit is found to be set. This is then cleared, and
C the second argument to the function is set to the appropriate value.
C A value of -1 indicates that there are no further arguments.
