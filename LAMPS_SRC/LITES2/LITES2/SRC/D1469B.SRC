C Created by Alan Wylie 5-Feb-1980
C From the Ordnance Survey CORAL66 squaring program
C
C Recompute endpoints on open side of squared figure/part figure
C 1) Set up appropriate coeffs of a line perpendicular to the current
C    line segment
C 2) Compute meeting point of the current line segment with
C    it's perpendicular.
C 3) Overwrite last point on feature/subunit with this computed point
C 4) Repeat 1) and 2) for the first line segment of the feature/subunit
