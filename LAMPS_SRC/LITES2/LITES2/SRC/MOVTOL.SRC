C	Copyright Laser-Scan Laboratories Ltd., Cambridge, England.
C
C	Created					RWR	13-May-1985
C
C	Subroutine to select the point to be joined or tied to
C	while edgematching.
C
C	Present algorithm is to project the two points onto the
C	base line and to take mean.
C
	IMPLICIT NONE
C
C Arguments
C
C - input
	REAL	XY1(2),XY2(2)		! ends of features
	REAL	LINE(2,2)		! line to edgematch to
C - output
	REAL	XY(2)			! resultant point
C
C Local Variables
	REAL	D1,D2			! perpendicular distances
	REAL	T1,T2,T			! proportions that line is
					! divided into
C
	CALL PRPDST(XY1,LINE,D1,T1)	! get distance from 1st point
	CALL PRPDST(XY2,LINE,D2,T2)	! get distance from 2nd point
C
C compute mean proportion
C
	   T = (T1+T2)/2		! take	midpoint
C
C  force to be within line
C
	IF (T.LT.0.0) T=0.0
	IF (T.GT.1.0) T=1.0
C
C compute this point
C
	XY(1)=LINE(1,1)+T*(LINE(1,2)-LINE(1,1))
	XY(2)=LINE(2,1)+T*(LINE(2,2)-LINE(2,1))
C
