C Created by Alan Wylie 5-Feb-1980
C From the Ordnance Survey CORAL66 squaring program
C
C Compute and apply correction to datum line
C 1) Compute sine of correction angle from
C	SUM(misalignments)/SUM(line lengths),
C    and cosine from sine
C 2) Recompute sine and cosine of datum line,applying correction angle
C 3) Recompute coefficients of homogenous equation of corrected datum
C    line according to orientation
C    normalise equation with respect to X or Y
C    indicate which (i.e. (A1) or (A2) set to unity)
