C
C	Hardware dependant version of bitpad initialisation
C	   ----   This version is for Sigma 6100   ----

	IMPLICIT NONE

C
C argument
	LOGICAL	ON			! turn on or off?
C
C parameters for dummy viewport
C Priority 1, active, visible, segment class '8000'X
	INTEGER	PRIO,ACT,VIS,CLASS
	PARAMETER (PRIO=BIT_PRIO,ACT=0,VIS=1,CLASS=BIT_CLASS)
C
	BITINIT = .FALSE.		! assume off
C
C it is only sensible to initialise bitpad if INIGKS has opened
C workstation
C	
	IF (ON) THEN			! turn on
	   IF (PRIOPT) THEN	
C
C define choice device 4 on bitpad puck buttons
	      CALL WDFCH(1,1,4,6,6,0,4,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1)
C
C set choice device 4 into request mode (if we don't do this then
C an error occurs when event mode set below)
	      CALL WSCHM(1,4,1,1)
C
C the choice and locator devices are eventually used in EVENT mode by
C INTERACT and GTDGXY. Only set to event mode in those routines,
C since this disables the Sigmex keyboard for normal use.
C
C create a viewport mapping the whole screen onto maximum VDC
C use this when reading the locator
C
C NB used to work with PRIO=0 (same as map viewport) on 6100 series - on
C 6200 series locator is then read from map viewport rather than this.
C PRIO=2 works on 6200, but display then behaves as single buffered??
C See also code that reads bitpad in INTERACT.
