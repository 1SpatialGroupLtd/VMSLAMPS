C this version is complicated by the need to sort out the screen menu
C
C if called from INPUT, (ie in initial state), and there is a menu,
C delete it and recreate it, to draw it on top of map
	IF (SCRINI) THEN
	   IF (SINDEX.EQ.STATE_INITIAL) THEN
	      CALL DELETE_MENU(.FALSE.)		! don't redraw map
	      CALL CREATE_MENU(IER)
C
C if called from FLVIEW (ie VIEWNG) and not using segments, 
C then screen menu has been deleted!, so redraw it
	   ELSEIF (VIEWNG.AND.(.NOT.USESEG.OR.UPDATE_SEG)) THEN
	      CALL CREATE_MENU(IER)
	   ENDIF
	ENDIF
C
C otherwise it is simple
C now update workstation
	CALL GUWK(WKID,REGFL)

	RETURN
