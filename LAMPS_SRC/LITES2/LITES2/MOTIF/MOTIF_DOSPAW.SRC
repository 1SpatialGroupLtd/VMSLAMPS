C Description
C
C	LITES2 cartographic editor SPAWN command.
C	This a a special version for MOTIF version.
C	In order to allow ASTs to process X events while spawned, we
C	actually use NOWAIT, but then hibernate (in user mode) until the
C	subprocess completes.
C	This leaves us susceptible to control-y, so disable it.
C	This version could be used for all LITES2 versions.
