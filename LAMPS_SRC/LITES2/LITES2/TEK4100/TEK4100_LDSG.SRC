C LITES2 GKS level routine
C Delete Segment
C
C Expect to be called either:
C (a) to remove a visible segment (old version of edited feature), or
C (b) to remove a limbo segment (already invisible)
C
C VISI indicates whether the segment is presently visible or not
C
C Version for single workstation, with redraw in black to erase

C arguments
	INTEGER*4	PACK(PAKLEN)
	LOGICAL*1	VISI		! true if visible
C
C do nothing if no displays
	IF (NODISP) GOTO 999
C
C do nothing if the feature is not in the segment store

C for true GKS environment, would be just...
	IF (USESEG) THEN

C remove highlighting if needed, and set selective erase if needed, then
