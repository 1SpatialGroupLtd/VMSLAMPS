C arguments
	INTEGER		NUMBER		! (in) workstation (1 or 2)
C
	CALL WSFXUP(0)			! prevent update	
	CALL WDSG(-1)			! and delete them
	CALL WRSGWK(1,-1)		! redraw
	CALL WSFXUP(6)			! default maximum fixup level
C
C frig units for this version
	CALL LDFPPM(4,YSIZE,XSIZE,YSIZE)
	CALL UNITS(XSIZE)		! 0-1 maps to screen width
C
	CALL WSELVW(MAP_VIEW)		! select map view
	CALL WSPVPT(0.5,0.5)		! set pivot point for cursor seg.
C
C and for a Westward, set segment position to the same (TEK
C does this automatically), and disable drawing cursor
	IF (WTYPES(1).EQ.1000) THEN
	   CALL WSSGXY(-2,0.5,0.5)
	   CALL CHKBF(10)
	   CALL ESCSQ('TM')	! operating mode 'remote invisible'
	   CALL TKINT(-1)
	   CALL ESCSQ('|C')	! esc|CA, disable drawing cursor
	   CALL TKCH(ICHAR('A'))
	   CALL TKCH(27)	! exit remote invisible
	   CALL TKCH(ICHAR('T'))
C
C also for Westward, call routine to define first 16 colours. The
C effect of this is actually to set delete mode for colour 0, and
C thick lines for highlighting with colour 15. This is for the
C monochrome display - will have to remove again to support colour.
