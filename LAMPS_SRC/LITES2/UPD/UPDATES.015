 4-Oct-1989	FIND.SRC				- Clarke Brunt
		Fix long standing bug whereby a FIND on the line segment
		joining two ST's in the feature sometimes set the vertex
		number incorrectly, so that e.g. subsequent NEXT or
		PREVIOUS would behave unexpectedly.

 4-Oct-1989	OIIH.CMN,IFFBDY,FLUSH,STDRAW etc	- Ron Russell
		add FS argument to STDRAW for passing to text routines

21-Sep-1989	STREND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use new fill area algorithm when rendering areas. The
		rendering of fill areas stopped working when, fill areas
		with invisible lines introduced in V2.9 (and thus never
		worked in a released version)

20-Sep-1989	DISP_RAS,IMAGEPIXEL.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Cope with grey scale LSI files

20-Sep-1989	UIS:SAVDIS.SRC	- Clarke Brunt

		INIGKS now fills in DISPAY_RASX etc. for
		displays 1/2 also.

17-Sep-1989	GETIFF,ENDSES,LOCKIF(new).SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		TOGGLE,OPTION.CMN etc.
		ENABLE IFFLOCK (default) allows IFF file locking.
		Notes: will not allow several users to edit the same file.
		Applies to IFF and INSITU command, but not READONLY.
		Applies cluster wide, but only to members of the same
		UIC group (SYSLCK privilege would be needed to do better).
		A file accessed over DECnet is not locked - a message
		is produced to indicate this.

16-Sep-1989	UIS:		- Clarke Brunt
		New GKSUISLIB to allow stored drawing into displays 3/4
		while in refresh mode - annotating displays 3/4 did
		not work.
		Version 2.9 has been patched.

14-Sep-1989	SHOPTI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New options BLANK, BOX and VECTOR (also replaced INTERPOL,
		that occurred twice, with MAPOPT - mapped IFF files -
		that had got lost somewhere in V2.9)

13-Sep-1989	HLP:CMDLIST.COM	- Paul Hardy
		New facility for generating command list from LITES2 help file

13-Sep-1989	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		new command OVERLAY BLANK [n] - to set colour for blanking
		behind texts

12-Sep-1989	DRWCURSPOS.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Call SRI_SET_Z.
		I believe that labels drawn with DRAW GEOG, DRAW TITLE etc
		would not have come out at the correct height on the KRISS,
		but I cannot test it!!

12-Sep-1989	LITES2.HLP	- Paul Hardy
		Layout changed so as to allow generation of a command list.
		Note that new entries should try and have a first line
		which describes the command, and be grouped by function.

11-Sep-1989	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands
			ENABLE BOX	 - draw texts as boxes
			ENABLE BLANK [n] - blank out background of texts
			ENABLE VECTOR	 - don't draw IFF data
			SUPPRESS VECTOR	 -  as above, but one shot

11-Sep-1989	SELEAL.SRC, DOSELE.SRC, RESTORE.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Add argument to SELEAL, to say if to decode DSTR as 
		tertiary argument. This was bug introduced in version 2.9;
		it was not realised that SELEAL was called from RESTORE.
		Version 2.9 has been patched.

 6-Sep-1989	SIG6000:,TEK_ARGS:LSCR.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Add WKID argument to LSCRS, as was done in UIS: some time
		ago. Other version should have it too, but never actually
		called.
		TEK_ARGS version 4.9 will not be setting overlay colours
		properly, but nobody uses overlays on ARGS anyway.

 6-Sep-1989	UIS:SCRINIT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Fix unlikely problem with KRISS screen menu.
		DISA then ENA SCREEN with KRISS disabled and no primary
		would leave SCRINI false, so impossible to activate KRISS
		menu with subsequent ENABLE SCREEN commands.

 5-Sep-1989	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell

 5-Sep-1989	FINREC.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't RASP, with "Nothing Found" message when BELL

		ensure they reach edge of screen.
		ADJUST.SRC amended.

30-Aug-1989	SIG6000:FLOAD			- Clarke Brunt
		Fixed FLOAD to allow parts of chars left and below zero
		in downloaded text.
		Published V2.9 LITES2SIG6000 patched to fix this bug,
		and to allow use on Ethernet SAA0:

25-Aug-1989	IMAGEBAND.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Improve behaviour when ends of bands coincide

22-Aug-1989	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
