22-Jul-1987		**** RELEASE TO LSL BUREAU *****

22-Sep-1987					- Ron Russell
		Do away with all (most) references to "TWO" and
		replace by "LITES2"; also rename images to new standard.
		Thus	: TWOUSRRTS becomes LSL$LITES2ROUTINES
			  and images become
			  LITES2GWS	   (was TWOGWS)
			  LITES2HRD	   (was TWOHRD)
			  LITES2SIG5000	   (was TWOS5000)
			  LITES2SIG6000	   (was TWOSIGMA)
			  LITES2TEK4100	   (was TWOTEK4100)
			  LITES2TEK_ARGS   (was TWOTVES)
			  LITES2UIS	   (was TWOVS2)

22-Sep-1987	INIT.SRC,INIGKS.SRC,WRTVER.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow Program name to be output

21-Sep-1987	ALL VERSIONS:			- Ron Russell
		INTERACT.SRC (and TABINIT)
		Allow Auxiliary input lines

16-Sep-1987	STDRAW.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Do no attempt to offset areas after offsetting a line -
		this produced garbage areas.
		Allow interpolated curves (GT 6) to be offset (FRTSIZ).

15-Sep-1987	VS2 version:			- Ron Russell
		Create window over whole screen, and push it to the back
		when it is created

14-Sep-1987	DOSPAW.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Re-do status line after spawn, in case spawned process
		spoiled it.

14-Sep-1987	D14IFC.CMN,D1469.SRC,DOTOLE.SRC,SHTOLE.SRC, - Ron Russell
		BLKDAT.SRC,SECOND.MAR,INISCL.SRC
		add SQCT - a tolerance for testing if a feature is closed
		(default 1.0)

11-Sep-1987	INIT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Use SET_EXPMAX. Use LSL_SET_OUTPUT(TWOPUT), for new
		LSLLIB, but supply LSL_SET_OUTPUT as a noop, so the
		old LSLLIB will still work for now.

10-Sep-1987	RDCH.MAR		- Clarke Brunt
		G^ on references to common variables, since they may be
		in LSLLIB shareable image. Split into two modules,
		RDCH (which can be deleted after the next LSLLIB
		release), and READ_STRING.

10-Sep-1987	MOAN,PACKER.MAR		- Clarke Brunt
		G^ on calls to LSLLIB, since now may be shareable image

10-Sep-1987	TRNALL.MAR		- Clarke Brunt
		Deleted, since now in LSLLIB

 8-Sep-1987	DOCANC,DOMACR.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Mark free descriptor by MACDSL(1,n) = 0, rather than
		(2,n).
		If a macro was empty, then it's descriptor was treated
		as free, so the next macro used it again, giving two
		macros with the same definition. This bug has been
		present since 03AU87 but should not have appeared in
		any releases.

 7-Sep-1987	JOUCMD,TIDY.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Do not try to close the journal file if it was never
		opened, also try to close it if an error occurs when
		writing it (since it will not now be closed later).

27-Aug-1987	CHPART.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Deal correctly with part operations of circle arcs -
		get start and end in correct order (before only
		checked if they were a full circle)

27-Aug-1987	AREA.SRC	- Ron Russell
		simplify calculation of areas for circle arcs

21-Aug-1987	SIGMA6100:INTERACT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow up to 70 characters for prompt when INQUIREing
		and then truncate prompt to this length; used to
		truncate at 20 characters, and overwrite something!

21-Aug-1987	DISPLAB.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Correct bug that caused labels to sometimes come out
		in middle of screen, rather than edge

18-Aug-1987	SIGMA6100:LRSGWK.SRC			- Ron Russell
		Don't clear bitpad viewport. Double buffering should
		now work, even with bitpad enabled. Hopefully new
		firmware will not leave crud when redrawing full map
		that does not fill screen.  We assume this used to
		happen!! 

14-Aug-1987	STDRAW.SRC				- Clarke Brunt
		Pass extra argument TRISCN to text drawing shareable
		image.

13-Aug-1987	ENDSES,RESTORE.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Set NODISP .TRUE. after closing GKS in ENDSES, and don't
		bother to set it in RESTORE.
		The only known effect of this is that a moan while
		QUITting on the GWS will not now attempt to ring the
		GWS bell, provoking traceback since GKS already closed.

 3-Aug-1987	DOCANC,REMCMD.SRC,SECOND.MAR		- Clarke Brunt
		Remove user (non PUCK/MENU) macros without trace using
		CANCEL. Name no longer appears in SHOW MACROS, and the
		macro may NOT be used after being cancelled (which it
		could before).
		New command CANCEL VARIABLE.

 2-Aug-1987	LABELS.CMN,BLDLAB.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Allow space for max possible label, and use %W/%REF to
		EXPAND, to avoid space padding

31-Jul-1987	ADDMAC,ADDVAR,ERRDEF.SRC,MOANMESS.TXT	- Clarke Brunt
		Better error message for 'too many variables'

23-Jul-1987	DOEXAM.SRC, DOSHOW.SRC, EXALL.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Try to tabulate coordinates of "BOX", "WINDOW" etc better

22-Jul-1987		**** RELEASE TO LSL BUREAU *****

22-Jul-1987	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New system varible $REGION

17-Jul-1987	FLUSH.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Add in sector of defining point for symbols and texts -
		occasionally one couldn't FIND at the defining point.

16-Jul-1987	STDRAW.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Jump explicitly to line code for fill areas (previously
		just fell through)

14-Jul-1987	DOPREV.SRC,DONEXT.SRC,DOLAST.SRC,DOFIRS	- Ron Russell
		Stop access violation when nexting and previousing
		with no found object
		Make LAST and FIRST act in same way as NEXT and PREVIOUS

13-Jul-1987	TVES:RFDRAW.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Implement blinking cursors

13-Jul-1987	TVES:STDINI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		As this removes refresh picture, set RFCURS to false

13-Jul-1987	TYPCTX.SRC, EXALL.SRC, DOEXAM.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Get height of texts from FRT when required

10-Jul-1987	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow $HEIGHT to give height of texts (in sheet mm)
		when taken from FRT

10-Jul-1987	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		Allow FORCE in text, symbol and modify state

 9-Jul-1987	NDMEND.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Drop old object in hand and call RFDRAW - should ensure
		that refresh picture remains correct on more displays.

 9-Jul-1987	SIGMA6100:RFDRAW.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Ensure that doesn't get into RFMOVE while MENDing -
		causes integer overflow.

 9-Jul-1987	DOSPAW.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Disable CTRL/C AST while SPAWNing, so that CTRL/C can be
		used normally in the spawned process.

 9-Jul-1987	INIT.SRC,SET_OUTBAND_AST.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		SET_OUTBAND_AST now in LSLLIB, so remove our version, and
		call new version in INIT.

 3-Jul-1987	CHPART.SRC,FILTF.SRC etc 	- Ron Russell
		Allow filtering of linear features

 2-Jul-1987	TEK4100:			- Clarke Brunt
		Optimise RFDRAW so that it doesn't lag behind when fast
		cursor tracking taking place. Hope still OK on emulators!
		Also in main SRC: (DRWGRD, DRWREG, TOGGLE), change all
		RFCURS frigs into OCSXY frigs (to get cursor updated), so
		that RFDRAW knows whether it has a cursor segment or not.

30-Jun-1987	SHTOLE.SRC,DOTOLE,INISCL,INTERP,ADDLIN,STDRAW	- Ron Russell
		Use coordlib for interpolation
		(remove routines AKIMA,MCONAL,EXTRPL,POLATE,INTPL

26-Jun-1987	STDRAW.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Bring drawing of fill areas up to date with FPP
		Invisible lines are now ignored (before filling started
		again). Island polygons can be connected to the outside
		by invisible lines, and fill areas will leave the island
		blank

26-Jun-1987	(LSL)FRTLIB	- Ron Russell
		correct TRI_BOUND.SRC so that it deals correctly with
		escaped characters; this affected the regions around
		texts.  Also tidied up situations like "'.", which
		gave an overlapping region.

26-Jun-1987	DONEXT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Stop access violation when "nexting" when there is no
		found object

25-Jun-1987	DOSHOW.SRC, DOTRAN.SRC, VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Remove development licence from transformations

18-Jun-1987		**** RELEASE TO LSL BUREAU *****

17-Jun-1987	TVES:			- Ron Russell

		WORKSTATION TYPE 1 4014 command

15-Jun-1987	VALVAR.SRC etc		- Ron Russell
		variables $COEFFS which give transformation parameters
		(All transformation stuff is hidden from normal user)

11-Jun-1987	STCIRC.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use R*8 arithmentic internally, to increase accuracy.
		Lines tended to drift off their circle with R*4.

10-Jun-1987	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Stop "Illegal argument to math library" when finding
		circle arc, exactly at centre

		colour.

		TEK4100:		- Ron Russell
		32 bit coordinates available where hardware copes.
		Use the WORKSTATION TYPE 1 32 command
		Still need to check they work on TEK terminals -
		particularly the bitpad reading - developed on RAMTEK
		terminal

   Jun-1987	TEK4100 and SIGMA6100:	- Ron Russell
		ENABLE SEGMENTS valid in READY state - at next redraw
		clears segment store, and draws into it from the host.

29-May-1987	INIGKS.SRC	- Ron Russell
		change "Initialising workstation" message to
		"Initialising primary workstation"

		and SHOW LIMITS commands
		Make EXAMINE LENGTH and EXAMINE AREA work on all graphical
		types

18-May-1987	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		EXAMINE BOX and ANGLE commands
		SHOW ZOOM, WINDOW and LIMITS commands

14-May-1987	FINREC.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Replace moan "Nothing found" with an inform, when
		CONTINUE has been enabled

13-May-1987	GKSSIGLIB	- CLarke Brunt
		Allow as many vertices in fill areas as the Sigmex
		says it will do, rather than a fixed 299.

13-May-1987	TOGGLE.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set CHASEL, when ANDOPT is altered, so that ENABLE AND
		takes effect at next redraw

13-May-1987	SIGMA6100:LSALLI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't set screen menu invisible

11-May-1987	TEK4100 and SIGMA6100 versions
		TSTSEG.SRC	- Ron Russell

11-May-1987	INIGKS.SRC	- Ron Russell
		use new version of TSTSEG, that returns .TRUE. or .FALSE.
		(not SEGOPT or .FALSE.)


 7-MAY-1987		**** RELEASE TO LSL BUREAU *****


 2-May-1987	STATUS.SRC, SCROLL.SRC, DOSCRO.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Improve scrolling, so that changing it, or the status,
		does not cause the whole screen to be erased. Tries to
		keep as much information on the screen as possible

 1-May-1987	DOTOLE.SRC, INISCL,FLVIEW	- Ron Russell
		Allow fixed find radius (after a UNITS command)

29-Apr-1987	SIGMA6100:		- Ron Russell
		Screen menus implemented on SIGMA6xxx displays.
		Only available if Bitpad enabled. Drawn in the annotation
		colour.

29-Apr-1987	SIGMA6100:INIWK.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Only set status line back again, when terminal is 
		Sigma.  Previously, the VT220 screen was unneccessarily
		cleared.

29-Apr-1987	TWOEXH.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set screen back to whole scroll area and cancel status
		area, without clearing screen.  This leaves messages on
		screen at end of session

28-Apr-1987	FLVIEW.SRC,INPUT.SRC,LABVIEW.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Call device dependant LUWK rather than GUWK, so that
		there is a device dependant hook at end of redrawing when
		not using segments

		all device dependant libraries:LUWK.SRC
		create, simply as call to GUWK, except for SIGMA6100
		version, which may put up screen menu again, if viewing.

16-Apr-1987	SIGMA6100 version: BITINIT.SRC		- Ron Russell
		Put up bitpad cursor in BITINIT, if not using wosp input.
		If using wosp input, and the bitpad, this is put up and
		taken down in INTERACT and GTDGXY.  This bug was
		introduced when determining WOSPIN was moved from GTDGXY
		and INTERACT to INIWK.

		SIGMA6100 version: GTDGXY.SRC		
		Only put up bitpad cursor if using wosp input. It was
		previously always put up, but only taken down if using
		wosp input.


14-Apr-1987	VAREFN.CMN, EFNLUN.PAR, OPTION.CMN,	- Ron Russell
		WORKS.CMN
		add control for function buttons

		SHOPTI.SRC, TOGGLE, SECOND.MAR
		ENABLE BUTTON command

		INPUT.SRC 
		call a new routine BUTINIT

		VS2 version - implement BUTINIT for button box
		on LSL$CONSOLE

13-Apr-1987	FIND.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Prevent getting incorrect vertex number when
		ENABLE ENDS on. Only occurred for a multi-ST feature
		with only one pack (all in one sector).

 8-Apr-1987	all INTERACT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Check for CTRL/C immediately before WFLOR.
		Only check for table monitor stream if expecting it
		(propagate SIGMA6100 update of 6-Feb-1987).

 7-Apr-1987	DOWIND,ABANDN,ABAWIN.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Re-arrange STDINI, and put extra call to RFDRAW. Should
		ensure that cursors and rubber boxes appear correctly,
		in particular on TEK4100 and SIGMA6100 versions.

 7-Apr-1987	HADCTRLC,SET_OUTBAND_AST,CTRLCAST,INIT.SRC - Clarke Brunt
		Use out-of-band CTRL/C AST instead of real one. Effect is
		that CTRL/C does not abort output (and e.g. hang Sigmex),
		but in addition, does not echo CANCEL. Now outputs
		message when the CTRL/C is acknowledged.

 6-Apr-1987	SECOND.MAR, DOWORK.SRC	- Ron Russell
		WORKSTATION TYPE command

 3-Apr-1987	EVAL.SRC,FUNC.MAR	- Clarke Brunt
		Add some trig. functions to expression evaluation. More
		can easily be provided on request.

 2-Apr-1987	DOSHOW.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Fabricate a secondary command, if SHOW has defaulted to
		SHOW POSITION in INITIAL state.
		This corrects the silly message:
		"SHOW invalid in INITIAL state" to now be
		"SHOW POSITION invalid in INITIAL state"

 2-Apr-1987	TOGGLE.SRC, MAR:SECOND.MAR, SHOPTI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		ENABLE DESCRIPTOR COMMAND

 2-Apr-1987	MAPS.CMN	- Ron Russell
		alter MAPORG and MAPSCL from I*4s to R*8s
		recompile all affected modules
		OPTION.CMN	- Ron Russell
	        add DESOPT, 	for ENABLE DESRIPTOR
		INISEC.SRC	- Ron Russell
		use R*8s to be compatible with MAPORG
		INPUT.SRC	-Ron Russell
		save SW corner of LITES2 coordinate system (for later
		use of system variables)
		IFFHDR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		use scale and origin from MD entry, in preference to
		those from MH entry

 2-Apr-1987	SIGMA6100:GTDGXY.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Only disable the input devices if WOSPIN. Since MUART
		version, SETUP AGAIN caused the bitpad to be disabled
		irrevocably.

 2-Apr-1987	SIGMA6100:INIWK,INTERACT,TABINIT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Check for LSL$TK=SYS$INPUT in INIWK instead of INTERACT.
		Set SIGMEX alpha plane on/off in INIWK, rather than
		delaying until INTERACT.
		Restart WOSP and set up altesc in TABINIT (not INIWK)
		so that don't get MUART commands on screen when not
		using a MUART.

 2-Apr-1987	FINVAR.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		LSL__UNEXPCMD (not LSL__UNEXPCMD2) so that duff system
		variable name produces the intended error message

30-Mar-1987	PRIME.MAR,DOSPLI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		allow spliting of circle arcs

30-Mar-1987	OFFTXT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use a saved version of specified offset, when offsetting
		composite texts. This caused each successive text component
		to be offset by the specified amount from the preceding (offset)
		one, not from itself.

27-Mar-1987	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		CLIP is valid in CIRCLE state

26-Mar-1987	INIGKS.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Set SCRNSY correctly when viewport restricted in Y.
		Caused incorrect bitpad tracking on Sigmex. Don't know
		whether any other problems.

26-Mar-1987	DOCLIP.SRC,CLPFRN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		clip circle arcs

25-Mar-1987	IFFLIB			- Clarke Brunt
		DECNET access to IFF files now works

23-Mar-1987	SIGMA6100:		- Clarke Brunt
		Completion of MUART table, and Sigmex string input stuff.
		Envelope mode now used on Sigmex which means that
		O/P TERM 1 must be set to $3E, and
		O/P PREC must be set to $0B in Setup B.
		This applies to all Sigmex users.

20-Mar-1987	INCTOT.SRC,CMPFRN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Optimise testing of circle arcs
		ARCREG.SRC - deal with more pathological cases

20-Mar-1987	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Position cursor correctly on circle arcs when finding.
		This was a bug introduced when editing FIND to allow
		$VERTEX to be set when on end of an arc

20-Mar-1987	GENAUX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Get the number of points as an I*2, not an I*4. Texts and 
		symbols should never have more than 32767 points, so calling
		GENAUX with an I*4 should not cause any problem.
		This was to correct a invalid argument to math library error
		that occurred with duff IFF files where the IENDS word of a
		text ST was set greater than 0

19-Mar-1987	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		allow FREE to be valid in ready state - otherwise cannot free
		cursor when there is a cursor constraint, but failed to find
		something

19-Mar-1987	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		allow intersection with arcs
		INTSCNA		- Ron Russell
		create- to find intersection of circular found objects
		with other linear and circular features

18-Mar-1987	INTSCN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		When found object is a circle (arc), cannot end up on
		a vertex when intersecting

16-MAR-1987		**** RELEASE TO LSL BUREAU *****


13-Mar-1987	BLKDAT,TRNFLN,RESTORE.SRC,SAVFLE.CMN	- Clarke Brunt
		Don't set SETUPF in BLKDAT - always set in TRNFLN.
		Save copy of SETUPF in SETUPS and restore it to this
		when returning to INITIAL state.
		Avoids problem of LITES2 saying 'no saved setup' after
		a return to INITIAL state just because neither TABLE
		nor BITPAD were enabled when first map was read in.

13-Mar-1987	[SIGMA6100.WKSLIB]	- Clarke Brunt
		Now flushes graphics buffer after multi-buffer primtives
		have been generated. Previously, the terminal was
		left in graphics state, and if LITES tried to output
		anything to the alpha screen before the buffer was
		flushed, it was interpreted as graphics commands, with
		disastrous results. Only affected users logging on to
		Sigmex itself.

12-Mar-1987	TEK4100:SCRNIT.SRC,LRSGWK.SRC,SCRINIT.SRC
		Screen menus work after a fashion (not accessable if
		positioned outside map view)

12-Mar-1987	SIGMA6100:*.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Now supports MUART table (ENABLE TABLE, DISABLE MONITOR).
		Non-MUART users will get a few garbage characters on the
		SIGMEX alpha plane when starting up - please ignore.
		Now uses GKS string input when the Sigmex
		is the login terminal, and bitpad or MUART table are
		enabled.

12-Mar-1987	DOSPAW.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Use WRITEF rather than INFORM(MSG_BLANK) to output
		two blank lines, since the latter actually outputs
		a single space, which overwrites output from SPAWN.

12-Mar-1987	[SIGMA6100.LIB]GKS.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Don't allow a zero size (integer) window to be set,
		since it hangs the Sigmex.

12-Mar-1987	DOEND.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Don't alter WINDOW before checking whether too small.
		Once a 'too small' window was set, then ZOOM would
		also say 'too small' even when OK.

10-Mar-1987	TDYIFF.SRC,ACDATE.SRC,	- Martin Reid
		ACS.CMN
		New AC dates to use AC value field instead of
		text.

 6-Mar-1987	ENDSES.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Allow WRITE on READONLY and INSITU files.

 6-Mar-1987	SETCOL,SETLIN.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		If PATTERN disabled, then set up patterned areas as
		ordinary areas. They were being drawn in the previous
		fill area attributes.

 5-Mar-1987	ACS.CMN,DRAWIN.CMN,LABELS.CMN,STRIKE.CMN,
		VTCTRL.CMN,WORKS.CMN	- Ron Russell
		align common blocks before a complete rebuild

 5-Mar-1987	SIGMA6100:RFDRAW,STDINI.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Set REFNG in RFDRAW so that STDINI is not called from
		STDRAW. When modifying symbols, this caused cursor to
		disappear, and the symbol refresh to erase the stored
		picture.
		Don't draw linear object in hand when in MODIFY state.
		Caused crud to be refreshed when MODIFYing.

 5-Mar-1987	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		1) work with distaces sqaured when finding arcs and circles.
		This caused circle arcs sometimes not to be found, when
		zoomed in
		2) set OBJNVRT for circles to be TRUE only when on start
		   or end of arc. This allows VALVAR to test for $VERTEX
		   correctly for circle arcs

 5-Mar-1987	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		test $END, $FIRST and $LAST correctly for circle arcs
		Now gives TRUE if on start or end of arc, as appropriate

 5-Mar-1987	VERTEX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		set FONVRT for arcs properly (TRUE if at start or end)
		Used by VALVAR (see above)

 5-Mar-1987	TEK4100:LSALLI,LSALLV.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Use DELVIS, as for SIGMA6100, so that SELECT DELETED
		works properly. That completes this item for both
		supported segmented displays.

 5-Mar-1987	DOPREV.SRC,DONEXT	- Ron Russell
		PREVIOUS and NEXT mean FIRST and LAST for circle arcs
		(stop access violation)

 3-Mar-1987	ENDSES.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Set origin offset before calling TDYIFF, so that
		region selection works for multiple maps on output.

23-Feb-1987	GETABL.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Don't pass colon on end of logical name to
		LIB$FIND_IMAGE_SYMBOL. This has been stopping
		direct table decode routines from working since
		8-Jan-1987.

 6-Feb-1987	SRC:MOANMESS.TXT		- Clarke Brunt
		Add %^W to a number of %I and %C (to continue the
		mod. of 5-Feb-1987)

 6-Feb-1987	SIGMA6100:RFDRAW.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Don't highlight object in hand when in MODIFY state -
		it is only there when MODIFYing so that it can be
		deleted on END. Check other RFDRAWs for this.

 6-Feb-1987	SIGMA6100:INTERACT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Problem that when bitpad active, a table puck press,
		(e.g. FIND) causes a spurious POS back to the puck
		position after FIND has moved cursor onto feature.
		Due to table streaming on all buttons - although we
		are not waiting for the stream event flag, we still
		check for HAD_STREAM, which tends to return TRUE after
		any button press when table in stream mode.
		Only a problem when bitpad active because the bitpad
		timer goes off every 0.2 seconds, and wakes INTERACT
		up, only for it to notice the stream event.
		Correction is only to check for HAD_STREAM when we
		are actually expecting it - see variable WAIT_STREAM.
		This should be done in all table monitor INTERACTs,
		though only a problem when there is e.g. a timer which
		keeps waking INTERACT up.

 6-Feb-1987	SIGMA6100:BITINIT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Set up dummy bitpad viewport with priority 1, not 0.
		This gets it to work on 6200 series (hope still does on
		6100). A side effect seems to be that the display always
		behaves as single buffered - Sigmex investigating.

 6-Feb-1987	SECOND.MAR	- Martin Reid
		ACS.CMN,FCS.CMN
		OPTION.CMN,
		BLKDAT.SRC,ACEDT.SRC,

		Include optional inclusion of "edit ACs" which have
		the date of editing of the feature in them

		HWTEXT to get downloaded text

 4-Feb-1987	GROPE.SRC	- Clarke Brunt

27-Jan-1987	[LITES2.TEK4100.LIB]TKOD02.MAR	- Clarke Brunt
		Get rid of TEK exit handler - if TEK was re-initialised
		after a return to INITIAL state, the exit handler was
		set up again, which resulted in a circular loop of
		exit handlers, hence inability to invoke debugger, and
		failure of the LITES2 exit handlers (no timer statistic,
		and VT screen not reset).
		The same would have applied to WOSPLIB, but owing to a
		bug, the TEK exit handler was never in fact set up!
