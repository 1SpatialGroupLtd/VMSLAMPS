
17-Jan-1989	******** Release of version 2.8 *****************

16-Jan-1989	DRAFTR.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Use new IFF fast reading routine IFF_COORDS

12-Jan-1989	DOANNO.SRC, SETANNO.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow ANNOCOL of -1 to label in FRT colour

12-Jan-1989	DOEDIT,DOTAKE,NDEDIT,NDLOOP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		SETEDT.SRC new routine.
		If ENABLE FLAGS, then ensure that the edited flag
		is set by EDIT VISIBILITY/ATTRIBUTES, TAKE ATTRIBUTES,
		EDIT POINT, and LOOP. (It wasn't if the operation
		was performed in-situ.

11-Jan-1989	various.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		ENABLE INVISIBLE removed. ENABLE IFFMAP added (default
		off) for memory mapped IFF files.

10-Jan-1989	DOIMAG,DOWIND,DIGCRN,DOZOOM,ABANDN.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Ensure that remains in SETUP state after zoom, rather
		than returning to READY.

 9-Jan-1989	TEK4100:Westward	- Clarke Brunt
		Change to suit OS monochrome terminal (n.b. will not
		now do colour without further changes, perhaps
		conditional on another workstation type, 1001?)
		Don't blink refresh unless ENABLE BLINK (this option
		normally applies only to the cursor). This is because
		blinking refresh interacts badly with the bitpad.
		Define colours 0 and 15 as thick lines, the former for
		use in screen menu annotations, the latter for
		refresh highlighting. OS will now not need to read
		a dummy colour table on the mono display.

 4-Jan-1989	GENAUX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Take into account increase in text lengths if dealing
		with italicised texts

 4-Jan-1989	EXFC.SRC	- Ron Russell
		EXAMINE FC command also gives TCCs of subtexts

 4-Jan-1989	SYSVAR.MAR, VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New variable $TCC to give the text component code for
		the current subtext of the found object

 4-Jan-1989	FLUSH.SRC, IFFBDY.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set COIPAK(PAKFC) to be the FC of the feature rather
		than the TCC of the component being flushed. This has
		been set in PUTCTX, so that FLUSH can check for a valid
		feature code. This will mean that selection by FC will
		select on the FC, rather than the TCCs
		SO SET COIFC IN IFFBDY AS WELL

23-Dec-1988	DOCHAN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Only change FC if changing CC when not in modify (part)
		state

22-Dec-1988	DOINVI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow INVISIBLE INVISIBLE sequence of commands

22-Dec-1988	all RFDRAW.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		In all versions except TEK_ARGS (which was already OK),
		don't forget to highlight the construction while doing
		an INCLUDE PART.

21-Dec-1988	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Look at all subtexts if doing a spiral search
		for a particular text

21-Dec-1988	LOADFO.SRC,LOADCOI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Make sure FOPAK and COIPAK have the feature code
		for this text component.

21-Dec-1988	DOFIRS.SRC,DONEXT.SRC,DOPREV.SRC,DOLAST	- Ron Russell
		Make these commands act like POINT in TEXT state.
		ie they do not go into modify (part) state. THIS IS
		an non UPWARDS COMPATABLE change. Command files that
		depend on these commands going into MODIFY(part) state
		should follow the above commands with THIS

21-Dec-1988	DRALAB.SRC	- Ron Russell
		When labelling composites texts, make sure GENAUX is
		passed the correct FC (TCC) by passing it a dummy
		pack

20-Dec-1988	REGCMN.CMN,OUTCLP.SRC,CLPFRN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow clipping of invisible lines

19-Dec-1988	DOANNO.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow annotation colour 0, to allow labels to be deleted

19-Dec-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands
		OPERATION USER_FEATURE
		OPERATION USER_POINT
		CANCEL USER_FEATURE
		CANCEL USER_POINT

16-Dec-1988	FLVIEW.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		On a segmented display, and if selections for
		ACs, categories, or styles were in force (and no
		others) then on re-draw, everything was drawn,
		ignoring the selections. A temporary workround
		was to make a spurious selection for something
		else e.g. FSN. Now fixed.

16-Dec-1988	SHVAR,PRTMAC,PRTVAR,SHCOMM,PRTSYS	- Clarke Brunt
		Do not truncate names to 12 characters in
		SHOW VARIABLES [$], SHOW PUCKS/MENUS, SHOW MACROS, and
		SHOW COMMANDS. Routine PRTSYS has been renamed as PRTVAR.

15-Dec-1988	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		Make POINT command valid in TEXT state

15-Dec-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		new commands SHOW CP
		             EDIT CP
			     with tertiary commands
					[n] NW x y
					[n] SW x y
					[n] SE x y
					[n] NE x y
			     where n is map number (or 1 by default) and
			     x and y are IFF units (may be altered by UNITS
			     command)

14-Dec-1988	LSTARR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		If existing element of arrays is on PRIVILEGED POINT
		list do not overwrite the value. This is a non-upwards
		compatable change for OS. See my respose to SPR 254
	   	FUPDAC.SRC
		Similarly for automatic dating of ACs - do not update
		ACs with type and value on PRIVILEGED POINT list

12-Dec-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands DRAW VECTOR and DRAW TITLE

 9-Dec-1988	DELFT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Invalidate GETVRT index if deleting its feature.
		Fixes a COLAPS which happened when repeatedly
		constructing features into one map and then changing
		them to another. The features occupied the same IFF
		address and were thought identical by GETVRT, which
		then produced "Bad pointer to ST" using its index.

 9-Dec-1988	ADJUST.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Maximum zoom factor for LSI files now 16, rather than 32
		For LSIs, IMAGE PIXELSIZE taken from LSI file, rather
		than defaulting to 1, and IMAGE ORIGIN set to half
		pixelsize rather than 0.0.

 8-Dec-1988	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		When finding circle arcs, call EIHRCB_HEAD, before
		getting coordinates.

		This bug manifested itself by
		occasionally refreshing circle arcs in wrong place
		(and the "box" coordinates being wrong) caused by
		the wrong coordinates being GENAUXed at this point
		and then being copied in HAULIN, rather than being
		re-GENAUXed, although the coordinates were read again
		there, and were thus correct. Presumably, also, circle
		arcs could not be found under certain circumstances, but
		I could not create situations where this happened.
		Bug introduced in version 2.0, when dealing with files
		with point attributes (and output revision level 1)

 2-Dec-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands
		1) DRAW POSITION
		2) DRAW GEOGRAPHICAL
		3) DRAW ABSOLUTE
		4) DRAW SHEET
		that mark and write the current cursor position on the
		screen

		and

		5) DRAW TEXT
		that writes "rest of command" on screen

 1-Dec-1988	SETCOL.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Supress thick lines in borders and hatching of fill areas
		if DISABLE THICK.

29-Nov-1988	PARAJUST.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Correct bug that
		1) caused division by zero when outputting a line
		   in the middle of the paragraph with only one
		   sub text
		2) caused these lines to be positioned wrongly, if
		   the paragraph was not left justified

28-Nov-1988	ALL:TABINIT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		If ENABLE DIAG, signal error when initialising table
		monitor does not work

   Nov-1988	New FRTLIB that allows clipping of symbols in patterned
		fill areas.

23-Nov-1988	LITES2*.LNK	- Ron Russell
		Do not link against LITES2ROUTINES any more
		(should mean faster image startup)

21-Nov-1988	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New command ROUTINE. This is like USER, (but takes 2
		compulsory integer arguments, the second one is same
		as USER's, the first is the external routine to use)

18-Nov-1988	SYSVAR.MAR,VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New system variable $PRIVPOINT - has point a
		"privileged point" attribute

17-Nov-1988	STRTSQ.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Clear "fixed point" flags. They were not cleared,
		so that after a feature with fixed points was squared,
		these points would also not be squared in subsequent
		features that were squared

17-Nov-1988	D1469B.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't move end points that are to be held fixed
		during squaring. Where an end point was supposed
		to be fixed, it was sometimes moved.

15-Nov-1988	GETCTX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Read number of coordinates there are (with GETATT)
		rather than just 1. This stopped texts with 2 points
		rather than a RO working correctly.

 9-Nov-1988	ASTYPE.SRC,READ_STRING.MAR	- Clarke Brunt
		Use LIB$LOCC to find ' rather than INDEX
		Use LOCC and MOVC3 rather than MOVTUC
		Should be faster, but difference does not seem to be
		observable amongst the general time taken to decode
		commands.

 9-Nov-1988	TOGGLE.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Set FRTHKS to agree with THKOPT. DISABLE THICK will now
		disable thick lines in symbols/texts as well as in
		other features.

 9-Nov-1988	INIT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Allow interactive input and output from mailboxes
		in addition to terminals (i.e. SYS$INPUT and
		SYS$OUTPUT being mailboxes). For input, LITES2
		would previously have exited. For output, the
		only difference is that prompts and bells are
		now sent to the mailbox in addition to normal
		output. N.B. CTRL/C cannot be sent to LITES2 via
		an input mailbox.

 8-Nov-1988	FLVIEW.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Call SRISLW to communicate new nominal linewidth to
		FRTLIB on a redraw. This means that thich lines in
		symbols/texts will now zoom correctly.
		SIG6000:SETLIN_SIGMEX - nullify the above change if
		using segments - want all thicknesses to be correct
		at initial scale.

 8-Nov-1988	STDRAW.SRC	- Martin Reid
		Change calls to symbol drawing routine to use list
		of attributes.

 8-Nov-1988	DOUSER.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Restore new FC after call to LDSG. Symptom was that if
		user routine passed back a feature with a different 
		feature code, and deleted the old feature - then in
		some versions of LITES2 would 'lose' the new feature
		code resulting in obscure errors.

 8-Nov-1988	DOEDIT.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		EDIT ATTRIBUTE now says "attributes after 18 ignored"
		if too many added, rather than "after 'actype'"

 8-Nov-1988	DRAFTR,FLUSH,STDRAW.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Pass list of attributes to STDRAW for the benefit of
		the symbol drawing routine. Add extra args to STDRAW
		in all the dev dep RFDRAWs and in TEK_ARGS:BOXTXT.

 8-Nov-1988	CMTCMD.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Add ASK (TABLE) to the list of commented out commands
		in the journal file.

 7-Nov-1988	LSORT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid access violation when re-drawing with ENABLE SORT
		and zero items selected or in window.

 4-Nov-1988	variables		- Clarke Brunt
		New system variable $MODTCC, for text component code
		when in MODIFY state. Put in as a last minute jiffy
		in V2.7. Not yet documented. Other things may be
		needed in MODIFY state. Check VALVAR to see whether
		implemented correctly.

 4-Nov-1988	******** Release of version 2.7 *****************

 2-Nov-1988	linking			- Clarke Brunt
		Move TOLEDG from CMN:EDGE to CMN:DRAWIN. This is so that
		its BLKDAT value doesn't mess up the LARGE link image
		cluster.
		Also for the benefit of link - the options files now
		set ISD_MAX to 120, and DZRO_MIN to 16. In order to
		keep main body code out of the COMMAND cluster,
		routines ABANDN and SUBVAR now have their global
		symbols removed from LITES2.OLB - these modules are
		explicitly included in the default cluster.
		The globals are deleted in any linking command files,
		to avoid them re-appearing if someone re-inserts the
		routines - if already done a harmless error will result.

27-Oct-1988	various.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		First official release of display overlays and image
		backdrop. New commands WORKSTATION OVERLAY, OVERLAY...,
		IMAGE..., SHOW IMAGES, SHOW OVERLAYS, and system
		variable $IMAGEVALUE. See documentation and help.
		N.B. The IMAGE command is licensed, you need the
		IMAGE option (which may be called "raster backdrop").
		Display OVERLAYS are generally available but only
		LITES2UIS and LITES2TEK_ARGS (on Sigmex ARGS) support
		overlays at present.

27-Oct-1988	UIS:BITINIT.SRC	etc	- Clarke Brunt
		LITES2UIS allows bitpad menu (bitpad must be fitted
		to VAXstation instead of mouse). See UIS workstation
		user guide.

27-Oct-1988	various			- Clarke Brunt
		New command ANNOTATION OVERLAY, sets display overlay
		for annotations when overlays are in use. The box
		showing the old window in the WINDOW MAP command, is
		now drawn in the ANNOTATION COLOUR, rather than
		always colour 1.

27-Oct-1988	TEK4100:various.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		LITES2TEK4100 now supports Westward displays, provided
		that they are fitted with the Westward Graphics Manager.
		The command WORKSTATION TYPE 1 1000 must be given in
		order to use a Westward. See TEK4100 workstation user
		guide.

27-Oct-1988	TEK4100:RFDRAW.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Refresh is now in colour 15 rather than colour 1. It
		still uses exculsive or mode, so the result now is that
		colour 0 (background) highlights in colour 15, 1 in 14,
		2 in 13 etc. Colour table should be arranged as required.

27-Oct-1988	FLUSH.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		During IFF read in, delete one point line resulting
		when feature has more than one CB (ST or ZS) entry
		and consists only of duplicate points. Features
		such as these previously became one point lines,
		which are invalid.

19-Oct-1988	PERCENT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Use INFORM to output the % complete messages, so that
		they may be suppressed with DISABLE INFORM

17-Oct-1988	MLITES2.COM	- Martin Reid
		new routine GETSYM.SRC added

17-Oct-1988	INIT.SRC, GETSYM.SRC,DRAWIN.CMN	- Martin Reid
		call to new routine GETSYM to get the
		special symbol drawing routine

17-Oct-1988	STDRAW.SRC, 	- Martin Reid
		allow special symbol drawing routine to be 
		called if LSL$SYMBOL_ROUTINE setup

13-Oct-1988	VALVAR.SRC,SYSVAR.MAR	- Clarke Brunt
		New system variables for statistic gathering -
		$SYSBUFIO, $SYSCPU, $SYSDIRIO, $SYSELAPSED, $SYSFAULTS.

13-Oct-1988	DOUSER.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Delete features correctly, when creating new ones.
		This sometimes caused an access violation, if there
		was no found object.

13-Oct-1988	OPNFIL.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid sometimes outputting incorrect error message when
		@filename fails to find the file.

23-Sep-1988	INTERP,STDRAW.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid problems with invisibles in GT 6 curves.
		1) Declare array correctly in INTERP to avoid traceback
		   when length 0 passed.
		2) Ensure interpolation re-initialised after an
		   invisible, so that invisible bit is not drawn

15-Sep-1988	VALVAR.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Correct numbers in "variable arg. out of range"
		error message for $COEFFS and $MDOFFSET

 8-Sep-1988	PRIME.MAR,SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		new commands ABSOLUTE - position to absolute coordinates
		             SHOW ABSOLUTE - shows absolute coordinates

 5-Sep-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Back to version 2.7 (development version)

26-Aug-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Version 2.6a - published as a interim version

23-Aug-1988	SYSVAR.MAR,VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New variables $TABLE, $LATITUDE, $LONGITIDE

23-Aug-1988	IFFHDR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Initialise projection data (not well checked yet)
		TOGGLE.SRC,INIT.SRC
		Set logging in GCTPLIB in accordance with DIAOPT

23-Aug-1988	PRIME.MAR,SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands GEOGRAPHICAL
		             SHOW GEOGRAPHICAL	

19-Aug-1988	CLRRSP.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New routine to cope with MOANing ditching current
		line and returning to 2nd level interactive input

17-Aug-1988	SYSVAR.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New System variable $RESPOND

17-Aug-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands CANCEL RESPOND
		             AFTER  ERROR

15-Aug-1988	SYSVAR.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New System variable $DISPLAY - .true. when workstation
		open and working

12-Aug-1988	SECOND.MAR,DOLABEL.SRC,DOANNO.SRC etc	- Ron Russell
		New commands:
		LABEL FEATURE 		(DRAW LABEL does as now)
		LABEL POINT		(DRAW LABEL annotates points 
					 - toggles with LABEL FEATURE)
		LABEL ATTRIBUTE type [value]
					(Select up to 5 attributes to
					 label with)
		DRAW MARK		(Draw a symbol at vertices of
					 linear features)
		ANNOTATE MARK n		(define symbol to use with
					 DRAW MARK)

11-Aug-1988	DOINQU.SRC			- Clarke Brunt:
		Attempt to ensure that a POS command is journalled
		if any cursor tracking has taken place whilst
		replying to an INQUIRE. Previously, INTERACT
		would generate the pending POS some time later, so
		the journal would be incorrect. Mechanism is still
		grubby, because the LET may never be done if
		assorted MOANS have happened.
		Also attempt to QUIT/DUMP if INQUIRE is done when
		no interactive input is available. This always was
		the intention, but in fact the INQUIRE was just
		ignored, and processing continued.

11-Aug-1988	SIG6000:LSCR.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Restore function of WORKSTATION COLOUR - broken in
		SIG6000 V2.6. Image patched, so that any issued from
		now will be OK.

10-Aug-1988	GROPE.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Don't use SECTRS array in GROPE, since region selection
		stuff uses it as well. Just call SCNSEC directly with
		each implicated sector. Allows FIND to work correctly
		with region selections.

 8-Aug-1988	FCS.CMN,BLKDAT.SRC,RELVNT,TDYIFF,DOSELE, - Ron Russell
		SHSELE,SELEAL
		implement new selection commands

 8-Aug-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands SELECT CATEGORY and SELECT STYLE
		which select TEXT features by category and style
		(and of course DESELECT)

 8-Aug-1988	DOEDGE.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Cancel any spiral search, so that SEARCH NEXT is invalid
		after edge-matching. Used to hang before.

 8-Aug-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Now working on version 2.7

22-Jul-1988	******** Release of version 2.6 *****************

19-Jul-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Release of version 2.6

13-Jul-1988	SHTOLE.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Add new tolerance to SHOW TOLERANCE command

13-Jul-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New command TOLERANCE SQPL - to set tolerance for
		testing for parallel lines while squaring (angle given in
		degrees)

13-Jul-1988	SIG6000:LSCR,WKSLIB	- Clarke Brunt
		Update workstation after changing colour so takes
		immediate effect.
		Fix relative addressing in cell array primitive in WKSLIB
		so that raster display works properly.

 8-Jul-1988	SHOPTI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New FIXED option

 8-Jul-1988	SECOND.MAR and all D14* routines	- Ron Russell
		BLKDAT.SRC

		New squaring algorithm
		New command ENABLE FIXED (default is on) that switches
		on New OS squaring algorithm. This implies:
		1) Points held fixed with PRIVILEGE POINT command are
		   acknowledged
		2) When part squaring to bases, after all bases are
		   used, unsquared lines in features are squared
		   internally
		3) Redundant points are removed from feature
		4) When holding the ends of short lines fixed, long lines
		   at either end will maintain their correct (new)
		   orientation

 6-Jul-1988	VALVAR.SRC,LITES2.HLP	- Clarke Brunt
		Change comments to agree with new variable names.
		Fix help on "Variables System $POINT" which had become
		part of $PC.

 6-Jul-1988	SIG6000:		- Clarke Brunt
		Bitpad tracking works on devices with less than
		1448x1024 pixels. Picture no longer distorted on
		6432 model. Explicit zero in 4th column of workplane
		line in colour table disables blinking.
		WORKSTATION COLOUR -2 r g b command also disables
		blinking (while -1 restores it).

 1-Jul-1988	RESTORE.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Set RIPNF = 0 to invalidate GETVRT index. Prevents
		index being used in error after return to INITIAL
		state, causing "Bad pointer to ST entry" collapse.

 1-Jul-1988	DRALAB.SRC,VINWIN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Correct bug that caused labels not to be drawn
		on features whose first vector started inside window
		and finished outside

30-Jun-1988	ISELAC.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Suppress FRTLIB error message for "ACD not found" which
		was produced during FIND, DRAW etc. when AC selecting.

29-Jun-1988	D14IFC.CMN,NDSQUA.SRC,STRTSQ	- Ron Russell
		Allow squaring to carry attributes of points
		through

28-Jun-1988	DOHELP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Use TTWSTR (not WRITEF) as output routine so that any
		%'s in the help come out correctly

28-Jun-1988	CHANAC.SRC,DOEDIT,DOOPER,DOSET,DOUNSET	- Ron Russell
		Check for privileged attributes (PRIVILEGE ATTRIBUTE)

28-Jun-1988	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New command SHOW PRIVILEGE

24-Jun-1988	GLOBAL.CMN,DEFINE.CMN	- Ron Russell
		PRIME.MAR,SECOND.MAR,-
		DOPRIV.SRC,PROCMD.SRC,CHK_SET_PRIV.SRC,BLKDAT.SRC
		New commands PRIVILEGE COMMAND
		             PRIVILEGE ATTRIBUTE
		             PRIVILEGE POINT

24-Jun-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Start again with Version 2.6 !!!

Updates to 22-Jun-1988 renamed as UPDATES.012
