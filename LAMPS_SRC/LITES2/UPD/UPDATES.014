
22-Aug-1989	******** Release of version 2.9 *****************

22-Aug-1989	DOIMAG,DISP_RAS,CLASSIFY	- Clarke Brunt
		Allow classification of byte,long,real data in addition
		to word. Forbid IMAGE STEP command for bit data.

21-Aug-1989	various		- Clarke Brunt
		Latest attempt at getting ZOOM 1 and DRAW SCREEN to keep
		same zoom factor when images (and IMAGE SETUP) in use.
		Use the window in image coordinates to calculate the new
		window, instead of the window in IFF coordinates.
		WINDOW MAP then ABANDON now returns transformation to
		normal. Previously it would cause highlighting to
		appear in the wrong place (when IMAGE SETUP in use)
		until the next redraw.

14-Aug-1989	DOANNO.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Prohibit fonts less than or equal to 0. These either
		give error messages, or have same action as positive
		font number.

13-Aug-1989	MAR:SECOND.MAR	- Clarke Brunt
		Tertiary commands for ENABLE KRISS - 
		DIALOG,MESAGE,SIDE,STATUS.
		ENABLE table therefore now has user flags.

		SRC:ENDSES,INPUT - extra argument to KRSINIT
		FLVIEW - call LUWK specially for KRISS
		INISCR - allow screenmenu on KRISS
		VTSTAT - call KRSINIT to update KRISS status line
		TOGGLE - field new ENABLE KRISS commands

		CMN:KERN,WORKS - more entry points to KERN shareable
		image, and KRISS screen menu stuff

		UIS: - additional KERN functionality. KRISS screen menu,
		status area, dialog area.

11-Aug-1989	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Release 2.9

10-Aug-1989	DOEND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow SET PROCESS to take effect if ending the
		construction of a text or symbol

26-Jul-1989	various		- Clarke Brunt
		SETLIN - call FRT_BEGIN_FILL
		STDRAW - call FRT_END_FILL
		Completes correct output of invisibles in the boundaries
		of areas.

25-Jul-1989	DOREGI.SRC,STSARG.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Call STSARG after setting selection bits in REGDEF
		In STSARG, only set SAREGS if in "Region select mode"
		This should make relvnt quicker, as SAREGS will more
		often be TRUE, when regions are defined (but not
		selected); it will also mean that the bug where AND is
		enabled and regions are defined, but not selected means
		nothing can be found/displayed.

24-Jul-1989	DODISP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Change .LE. to .LT. in DISPLAY CREATE so that DISPLAY
		COLOURS 16 uses 4 planes and not 5

24-Jul-1989	various		- Clarke Brunt
		SETLIN - call LSG_BEGIN_AREA
		STDRAW - call LSG_END_AREA
		STDBFF - allow 1 or 2 point area components to be output

21-Jul-1989	SYSVAR.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New variables $DISPLAYNUMBER
			      $OVERLAYNUMBER
			      $CONSTRUCTION_LAYER
			      $CONSTRUCTION_FC
			      $CONSTRUCTION_MAP
			      $IMAGE_EXIST n

13-Jul-1989	INPUT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Centre cursor position earlier (before DSRINIT) so that DSR
		not driven to a silly place

13-Jul-1989	INIGKS.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Set WKID=1 after loop so as to avoid WKID=3 problem if
		only a KRISS enabled

13-Jul-1989	DOSUPP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Allow SUPPRESS PRIMRARY if a KRISS enabled

12-Jul-1989	DOINCL.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Cancel any generated feature instruction (eg CIRCLE CENTRED,
		or RECTANGLE SIDE)

12-Jul-1989	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New command FEATURE REGION n

10-Jul-1989	SECOND.MAR,etc	- Ron Russell
		new command SORT GT - sort by (inverse) graphical type

 5-Jul-1989	DOFILT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't allow FILTER and MOVE commands in same part operation

 3-Jul-1989	SECOND.MAR et al	- Ron Russell
		New optional tertiary commands to SELECT ALL
		SELECT ALL AC
		           CATEGORY
		           FCS
		           FLAGS
		           FSNS
		           LAYERS
		           MAPS
		           REGIONS
		           STYLE

		SYSVAR.MAR et all
		new system variables
		$REGIONAREA n

		$HADSELECT
		$HADSELECT_AC
		$HADSELECT_CAT
		$HADSELECT_FC
		$HADSELECT_FLAG
		$HADSELECT_FSN
		$HADSELECT_LAYER
		$HADSELECT_MAP
		$HADSELECT_REGION
		$HADSELECT_STYLE

		$AREA is now a DOUBLE system variable

28-Jun-1989	SYSVAR.MAR,VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New system variable $HADSELECT

27-Jun-1989	INCTOT.SRC,CMPFRN.SRC		- Ron Russell
		Test composite text features correctly against regions.
		This did not work at all; Regions were programmed before
		composite texts were thought of!

26-Jun-1989	JOITXT.SRC,NDSTCN.SRC,STSYTX	- Ron Russell
		Save pack of found object, so that it can be deleted
		in future. Previously, features were deleted as they were
		added to the text being modified. If this was abandoned,
		the original features were lost

26-Jun-1989	PARAJUST.SRC, DOPARA.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Justify correctly.
		1) justifying to specified distance did not work exactly
		2) justifying italic text did not work correctly

22-Jun-1989	DOSPLI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set COIFC and COIPAK(PAKFC) correctly when splitting
		texts apart - when this results in features with single
		subtexts	

22-Jun-1989	CMPFRN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set flag correctly if testing ARCs for in or out of
		region.
		Circle arcs were always inside AND outside region, if
		they did not cut it

19-Jun-1989	GENAUX.SRC,DOPARA.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Take account of variable amount of slope in italic texts
		when calculating size of box around italic texts

		If LITES2 linked with new FRTLIB, variable sloped italic
		texts available

19-Jun-1989	VARIABLE.CMN	- Clarke Brunt
		Make TSTCMD CHAR*255 (not 80). Avoids possible access
		violation if the command part of an ELSE or THEN
		command is longer than 80 characters.

12-Jun-1989	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		When finding texts, pass a pack with TS set in
		PACK(PAKFC). This is so that GENAUX will calculate
		correct size of texts if height is not enabled (and
		so height is not passed to GENAUX)

12-Jun-1989	USER.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Calculate correct size of subtexts of composite texts

 9-Jun-1989	USER.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow symbol string featues to be created properly.
		Features with only one point were being constructed.

 8-Jun-1989	EXCEPTION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't output warning error message when starting
		shared image with compilation error warnings. This
		overrides bug fix put in version 2.9 (see below).

 8-Jun-1989	DRALAB.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow marking of features of graphical types 1,6 and 12
		only. (Previously allowed GTs 1, 11 & 12)

 8-Jun-1989	UIS:BALINIT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid possible traceback in the unlikely case of a
		QUIT back to INITIAL state while left mouse button
		is held down, followed by reading in another map.

 8-Jun-1989	DOIMAG.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid 'argument out of range' message when second
		argument to IMAGE PIXELSIZE is omitted.

 1-Jun-1989	DOTEXT.SRC, SUBSTX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Stop zero length texts being generated in the TEXT and 
		SUBSTITUTE commands. These cause problems in that
		they cannot be found.

22-May-1989	SHGRP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Allow SHOW GROUP to display feature codes up to 32767.
		Previously only codes up to 4095 were displayed, despite
		higher ones being in the group.

11-May-1989	UIS:BITINIT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid traceback if BITPAD enabled but PRIMARY not enabled
		in UIS version (bitpad may not be used without primary
		screen in any case).

11-May-1989	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New command SHOW LIGHTS

 9-May-1989	USER.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		After USRRET, only utilise RTSTR up to RTSTRL in case the
		user has filled the rest of it with rubbish e.g. nulls

26-Apr-1989	SYSVAR.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New system variables DISPLAYCOLUMNS
		                 and DISPLAYROWS

26-Apr-1989	variables,macros		- Clarke Brunt
		Increase number of variables and macros to 500 each

20-Apr-1989	DOREGI.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		REGION now takes two optional reals after the
		integer. If present, then a single point is added
		to a region, which need not already exist.
		The command is now valid in INITIAL and READY states
		in addition.

20-Apr-1989	DODRAW,DRWREG,DISPRN.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		New command DRAW AREAREGION n, like draw region
		but draws it as a solid filled area.

19-Apr-1989	DRWCURSPOS.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Text in DRAW TEXT/TITLE may now be in double quotes
		(a way to get leading spaces, or only spaces!)
		Slightly non-compatible change.

19-Apr-1989	dev dep TABINIT,INTERACT	- Clarke Brunt
		Avoid problem whereby when using the table monitor, the
		next keyboard command was lost after an IFF command
		which wasn't from the keyboard.
		As a side effect, all versions now use a value of a
		quarter second to distinguish streaming from a table.
		Versions other than SIG6000 and SIG5000 previously
		used a tenth second.

13-Apr-1989	various - displays		- Clarke Brunt
		New commands DISPLAY..., ANNOTATION DISPLAY, DRAW MOVE,
		SHOW DISPLAY

12-Apr-1989	PRIME.MAR,SECOND.MAR etc	- Ron Russell
		New commands VIEW xxxx yyyy
		             SHOW VIEW

12-Apr-1989	NXTCMD.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set LAST_MOANED every time MOANED is cleared, rather than
		just at start of routine. This caused errors while decoding
		a command not to set the $MOANED system variable

 7-Apr-1989	BRIDGE.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use IMCZI and IHCZI when testing if marked points have
		Z values (rather than CSZI!!!)

 5-Apr-1989	CMTCMD.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Add FOLLOW command to commands that should be commented
		out in journal file

31-Mar-1989	INTSCN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use INTSCTR instead of INTSCT. This takes into account
		the "thickness" of a line. This means that features that
		have been extended to meet a feature, will later
		intersect with that feature. This was in response
		to SPR 393

28-Mar-1989	STRTFT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Clear COMTXT. Nothing else cleared this flag, so
		when constructing circles and arcs, they were sometimes
		flushed with wrong PACK(PAKFC). This caused the arcs to
		be unfindable (and also a possible cause of access
		violations). Bug introduced in version 2.8.

14-Mar-1989	PRIME.MAR,SECOND.MAR,DOFOLL.SRC	- Ron Russell
		and INTERACTS 
		New commands FOLLOW TABLE
		             FOLLOW DSR
		             FOLLOW SCREEN

12-Mar-1989	FINVAR.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		At last - array variables (and system variables with
		compulsory integer arguments) allow another integer
		variable as their subscript. Thus, assuming that
		ARRAY is an array variable, and I is an integer, one
		would access the I'th element of ARRAY by e.g.
		%message Value is 'ARRAY'I''
		The final two quotes are optional as usual.

11-Mar-1989	DISP_RAS.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Draw as many columns of the DTI as possible in a single
		operation, rather than one at a time.
		Speeds up GPX image drawing by a factor of something
		like 4-5 depending on the drawing direction, number
		of planes etc.
		It is now possible to draw a full screen image on the GPX
		in about 2 seconds under optimum conditions, which means
		a byte DTI, corner NW, direction clockwise, an 8 plane
		overlay (needs WORKSTATION TYPE 1 7000), and no IMAGE
		BITS commands.

11-Mar-1989	UIS:SAVWIN.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		SAVE WINDOW now removes the cursor first, so that it is not
		saved in the picture.

 8-Mar-1989	CMN:MACMEN.PAR,MACRO.CMN,VARIABLE.CMN,INIT.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Increase number of variables/macros to 200 each. Remove
		declaration of byte arrays for INITAB since no longer
		required. Pass dummy arguments to INITAB in INIT instead.
		Users will now be able to define the full 200 variables/macros
		each with up to 16 characters in the name.
		Also increase length of DVAR so that e.g. SHOW VAR
		$CURSINWIN 0.1234567 does not run out of space for
		the variable name.

 8-Mar-1989	PRIME.MAR, various SRCs	- Ron Russell
		Allow INSERT in CONSTRUCT state, to construct an intersection

 8-Mar-1989	variables		- Clarke Brunt
		New system variables $IMAGEROWS, $IMAGECOLUMNS,
		$IMAGEORIGINX/Y, $IMAGEPIXSX/Y, $CURSINIMAGE

 7-Mar-1989	PRIME.MAR and various .SRC and .CMN	- Ron Russell
		New commands RECTANGLE DIAGONAL and 
		             RECTANGLE SIDE to generate rectangles

 7-Mar-1989	various.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		New commands SAVE LUT n file, and SAVE WINDOW n file
		write out an overlay LUT LCM file, and a DTI file of
		the VAXstation window respectively.

 6-Mar-1989	DOWRIT.SRC, DOEXIT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow file name when multiple maps read in, but only one
		has been selected for output	- new feature

 6-Mar-1989	D1469.SRC	- Ron Russell
		When checking that coefficients of lines have been set
		only check that on of A1,A2 and B1,B2 are not zero.
		One of them can be zero for lines at 0 or 90 degrees.

		This caused features squared to lines at 0 or 90 degrees
		not to be squared

 1-Mar-1989	DOSHOW.SRC,TRNSET.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Message for SHOW SECTOR in DOSHOW and warning message
		in TRNSET gave wrong mm values (multiplied IFF units
		by SCLFRT, rather than divided)

28-Feb-1989	various.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Add ENABLE DSR, and provide skeleton DSRINIT device
		dependent routines. (Only intended to function in UIS
		version).

28-Feb-1989	TOGGLE.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Only enable/disable PME if not already enabled/disabled.
		Avoids disastrous exit/access violation.

24-Feb-1989	MOANMESS.TXT	- Martin Reid
		Change VALVARC message from %S80 to %S

23-Feb-1989	SYSVAR.MAR	- Martin Reid
		VALVAR.SRC
		BLKDAT.SRC
		New system variables added $FILELINE and $EOF

23-Feb-1989	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Make $LATITUDE and $LONGITUDE DOUBLE variables (were real)

23-Feb-1989	OTRANS.CMN, INIMAP.SRC, TSTDGI.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Limits of map are stored in IFF units, so limits are
		rectangular, and there is no need to do a "point in 
		polygon test" against a limit. (This caused odd effects
		when using IFF units that were small (< 1.0))

		Note: by changing common block, setup from version 2.8
		will be invalid for this release of LITES2. 
		Users will have to redigitise menus and tracking areas.

		Also took opportunity to allow users to increase range
		of IFF files, use existing setup, and still access
		increased range of map

22-Feb-1989	UIS:various.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Correct allowed number of colours on 4-plane display.
		See UIS workstation guide for use of WORKSTATION TYPE
		and LSL$UIS_MAX_COLOUR logical name. Default is still to
		use 64 colours (6 planes) on 8 plane display, and 8 colours
		(3 planes) on 4 plane display.

22-Feb-1989	PRIME.MAR, SECOND.MAR	- Martin Reid
		New FILE commands		

22-Feb-1989	TIDY.SRC	- Martin Reid
		To close any FILE command files
		still open

22-Feb-1989	BLKDAT.SRC	- Martin Reid
		To preset FFILES.CMN

22-Feb-1989	EFNLUN.PAR	- Martin Reid
		add minimum and maximum luns for
		FILE command files

22-Feb-1989	MOANMESS.TXT				- Martin Reid
		New moan messages for FILE commands

22-Feb-1989     DOFILE.SRC, CLOSE_FFILE.SRC, 		- Martin Reid
		FILE_CLOSE.SRC, OPEN_FFILE,SRC
		OPEN_FILE.SRC, SELECT_FFILE.SRC
	        WRITE_FFILE.SRC, READ_FFILE.SRC
		New routines for new commands
		FILE OPEN, FILE CLOSE, FILE READ,
		FILE WRITE, FILE CREATE, FILE SELECT
		FILE APPEND  
		New common block FFILES.CMN

22-Feb-1989	SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands FORCE SLOPE and FORCE FLAT (only valid when
		Z enabled)

22-Feb-1989	D1462.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't assign value to STATUS, as it is bit set; rather
		OR the required value into it. Assigning 1 to STATUS (when
		invisible line LA = 0.0) caused bit 8 to be cleared, and the
		ends of invisible lines to be removed on occasions

21-Feb-1989	EFNLUN.PAR	- Ron Russell
		Use same LUN for edgmatching, as for all other simple
		file writing (ie where file is opened, written and closed)

 6-Feb-1989	OFFALL.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Carry point attributes through - New feature

 6-Feb-1989	OUTARCS.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Reset start of arc correctly when clipping full circle
		arcs. This clipping only worked on full circle arcs, when
		the start angle of the arc was 0.0. (This is the case
		with full circum circles, on which it was probably tested)

 6-Feb-1989	DOPOIN.SRC			- Ron Russell
		Make the POINT command take you into MODIFY (part) state
		if give when in MODIFY state, to make it compatitble with
		NEXT, FIRST etc

 3-Feb-1989	DOROUT.SRC			- Ron Russell
		Index user routines reserved for LSL use correctly. They
		were previously indexed on top of those for user use,
		with the result that if ROUTINE 1 n had been given,
		ROUTINE 101 n would access the same image.

 2-Feb-1989	NDBEND,DOCOLL,COUNT_CHAR.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		BEND STRETCH now treats characters with zero width (in
		the TRI) as being diacritical marks, and considers them
		to be part of the following character for spacing
		purposes. Note that the width (the AC 3 in the TRI)
		must be exactly zero.
		As a side effect, texts with the $ escape character are
		now spaced correctly
		Also an attempt to stretch a text round a zero (or very
		tiny) part of a circle now uses the whole circle if the
		feature is a whole circle (any 	graphical type 2-5), or
		just the tiny arc if not.
		Previously, for graphical type 2-4, this would result
		in a "Duplicated point ignored" error, followed by
		access violation.

		COLLAPSE also recognises the diacritical marks when
		deciding whether a composite text is a series of words
		(put spaces between) or letters (don't).

		For Sigmex users using ENABLE HWTEXT, characters with
		zero width are 	downloaded to the Sigmex with a very
		small finite width to allow them to plot correctly, so
		there is no longer any need to give them a finite width
		in the TRI.

 1-Feb-1989	EXCEPTION.SRC, SETUP_USER.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Output a blank line after the SYS$PUTMSG of the
		'EOMWARNS' error, so that it is not overwitten by the
		next line of output.

31-Jan-1989	IFFBDY.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Do not set the "Date last edited field" in OS map headers
		any more (MOD M736)

30-Jan-1989	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		When searching for a particular text, start looking at
		start of feature, not at the TS pointed to by pack. The
		effect of this bug was to sometimes fail to find a subtext
		containing a string specified in a SEARCH TEXT command. It
		depended which pack was used to find the text; ie where the
		search started from

27-Jan-1989	FIND.SRC, INTSCNA.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set the vertex of the found object correctly when intersecting
		a line with a circle arc. This bug sometimes caused
		the cursor to jump to start of found object if constrained
		on it, after an intersection with a circle arc.

24-Jan-1989	FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Find Z coordinate where required

23-Jan-1989	STCIRC.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Make sure closed features are closed. There was
		occasionally a rounding error.

23-Jan-1989	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New system variables $CURSZ, $CURSZ_EXIST, $COLOUR and
		$CURSINREGION

23-Jan-1989	STRTER.SRC	- Ron Russell
		If Z enabled, use Z value of cursor when adding point to
		feature
		DOPOSI.SRC, DOABSO.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow Third argument (Z). If two arguments given Z is unset
		but if no arguments given, cursor is centralised in X and Y,
		but Z is left as it was.
		NOTE: SHEET and GEOGRAPHICAL do not take height;
		nor do they alter the Z value of the cursor

22-Jan-1989	variables.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		DOUBLE variables hopefully implemented properly. System
		variables could now be DOUBLE ($MDOFFSET done for example,
		made type 4)

21-Jan-1989	variables.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Allow user to declare array variables, and also a
		double (REAL*8) type (DECLARE DOUBLE). Same as REAL
		at present.
		Arrays work as in DECL INTEGER I3 (1 to 65535 elements)
		LET I2=27
		CAN VAR I
		No provision at present to SHOW an entire array, or to
		show number of elements (except by intentionally using
		an out of range subscript).

20-Jan-1989	PRIME.MAR	- Ron Russell
		Allow 3 coords to POSITION command

20-Jan-1989	SECOND.MAR, OPTION.CMN, BLKDAT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		ENABLE Z	- licensed command (at moment)

20-Jan-1989	PARANORM.SRC, PARAJUST.SRC, PARAFILL.SRC   - Ron Russell
		use correct FC in PARA_DUMPAK, whenever a new subtext
		is opened
		PARAJUST.SRC
		use correct height of text when GENAUXing

		The second of these caused a bug when justifing subtexts
		that had varying sizes. The first would presumably have
		done the same, for text FCs with different fonts, or
		if DISABLE HEIGHT, and FCs with different text heights

19-Jan-1989	EXCEPTION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow user-routines with compilation warnings.
		A message is output when image is invoked.

19-Jan-1989	GENAUX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Only take account of overhang in italicised text if not
		paragraphing (to correct bug that my last change to GENAUX
		made when paragraph justifying text)

18-Jan-1989	DOPARA.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Don't allow lengths of lines to be equal or less than 0.0

18-Jan-1989	PARAFILL.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Always put a word in a subtext, even if it does
		not fit. Not doing this caused the first word in
		a paragraph of text to be null, if filling to a distance
		shorter than the first word.

18-Jan-1989	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Now working on version 2.9

Updates to 17-Jan-1989 renamed as UPDATES.013
