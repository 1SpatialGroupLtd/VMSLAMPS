23-Jun-1988 	********* Release of Version 2.5 **************

22-Jun-1988	STORE_ACSEL.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use parameter file INEQ from LSL$CMNLSL, rather than our
		own copy (which has been deleted)

21-Jun-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Version 2.5 - ready for new release

21-Jun-1988	various					- Clarke Brunt
		Implement selection by AC

21-Jun-1988	BLKDAT,DOLABE,MOANMESS,GET_ACTYPE	- Clarke Brunt
		Forbid negative AC types/attribute codes. Avoid
		accidental labelling with AC text when not required.
		Avoid FRTLIB message when labelling with AC not
		defined in FRT.

13-Jun-1988	MASTER.CMN,SYSVAR.MAR,INIT.SRC,VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New system variables $ELAPSEDSEC and $DATETIME
		$ELAPSEDSEC is time in seconds since LITES2 started

13-Jun-1988	FINVAR.SRC,VARIABLE.CMN	- Ron Russell
		VALVAR.SRC,SYSVAR.MAR
		Allow real arguments to system variables.
		Allow $CURSINWIN to take optional real argument, which
		is fraction of window to test (in range 0.0 -> 1.0)

13-Jun-1988	DRALAB.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Draw label in one point symbol strings as though 
		it is a one point symbol

 5-Jun-1988	TDYIFF.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		When adding edit date AC to a feature which did
		not have one, would not check following ST/CB for
		updating the range entry.

24-May-1988	MSGCMD.SRC			- Clarke Brunt
		Use DSECL rather than DSECN to determine whether
		secondary command is present (so that secondary not
		lost after GET_COMMAND). Hope this is OK.

24-May-1988	ATTDECOD,GET_ACTYPE,GET_ACVAL	- Clarke Brunt
		Break ATTDECOD down into latter two subroutines, so they
		can be used elsewhere

19-May-1988	various			- Clarke Brunt
		SELECT/DESELECT AC command inserted, but not yet implemented

25-Apr-1988	COUNT_SUBTEXT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Count number of Subtexts correctly!!!!!!!!
		(see below!!!!)

13-Apr-1988	UIS:LSCR.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		On 4 plane VAXstation, use 16 colours if WORKSTATION TYPE
		7000, otherwise 8 colours (as before).

		Allow all known types of CPU

12-Apr-1988	GETVERSION.SRC	- Ron Russell

		SPLIT APART command, when splitting at 3rd subtext, first
		subtext was lost

11-Apr-1988	INSRTCTX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set pointer to list of attributes to 0. LIB$_GET_VM
		does not necessarily do this (after returning to INITIAL
		state). This sometimes caused LITES2 to hang, when
		searching for things, after reading more maps in. Bug
		introduced with version 2.0.

		Same bug as in ADDCTX below

10-Apr-1988	DOEDIT.SRC and IFFSHR.EXE - Clarke Brunt
		Owing to IFFLIB bug, it was impossible to EDIT VISIBILITY
		in-situ at output revision level 0. It was impossible
		to make any invisible segment visible, or to make the
		first segment of an ST invisible. IFF problem fixed.
		Also, versions of LITES2 redrawing the feature to delete
		it also failed to do in-situ EDIT VISIBILITY with an
		IFF 'NOCB' error. This was due to call to LDSG losing
		IFF position after GETVRT called. Call GETVRT again.

		New system variable $LAYER_EXIST n

25-Mar-1988	ADDCTX.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set pointer to list of attributes to 0. LIB$_GET_VM
		does not necessarily do this (after returning to INITIAL
		state). This sometimes caused LITES2 to hang, when
		searching for things, after reading more maps in. Bug
		introduced with version 2.0.

22-Mar-1988	PRIME.MAR, SECOND.MAR	- Ron Russell
		New commands PTOLERANCE OSSETUP
		             PTOLERANCE EDGESETUP
		             PTOLERANCE RESIDUALS

		             SETUP TABLE_COUNT

22-Mar-1988	NDLOOP.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Edit last point as well as first - bug introduced
		15-Dec-1987.

22-Mar-1988	DOOSSE.SRC	- Ron Russell

		is used in conjunction with SETUP TABLE_COUNTS, then
		SETUP TABLE_COUNTS must be given first

17-Mar-1988	DOSETU.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New command SETUP EDGE

11-Mar-1988	SECOND.MAR			- Clarke Brunt

		for e.g. IFF command are actually compulsory

 9-Mar-1988	TRNTIP.SRC, MNUBOX, DOASK, TRNUSE, TRNSET - Ron Russell
		SHSETU.SRC
		Use new transformation

 9-Mar-1988	DOSETU.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Allow SETUP TRANSFORM -1, for projective transformation

 7-Mar-1988	CMTCMD.SRC	- Clarke Brunt
		Add "AFTER" to the list of commands commented out in the
		journal file - otherwise command is done twice.

 3-Mar-1988	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		New character system variable $HWTYPE, that contains
		the type of hardware that this version of LITES2 runs
		on.
		Also $VERSION, that contains version number

 2-Mar-1988	DOTEXT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set ADD_FLG true, so that new texts will have ACs
		defined by OPERATION ADD_FEATURE

 2-Mar-1988	NDSQUA.SRC, NDORIE.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Call STRTFT with IHPAK; no need to use COIPAK, as only
		PACK(PAKMAP) AND PACK(PAKPNF) are used in STRTFT (in
		GETAC)	- just a tidy

 2-Mar-1988	COIDLE.SRC, NDSTCN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Always take feature into hand, so that NDSTCN can
		call STRTFT with IHPAK.
		Now no problem changing texts and symbols between maps

 2-Mar-1988	STRTFT.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Call GETAC before selecting map, as GETAC may select
		a different map, if ACs are not in AC sector
		This caused an "IFF error NF" when features that had
		ACs had their maps changed.

 1-Mar-1988	PRIME.MAR, DOJOIN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		JOIN command works for texts, when in modify and a
		text found object

		a VO.

19-Feb-1988	HAULIN.SRC, GETVRT.SRC, FIND.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Accept 'VO', when expecting a 'CB'. These voids are
		put between CBs when removing points from features
		in situ.

		Version 2.3 (development version)

17-Feb-1988 	********* Re-Release of Version 2.2 **************

		Version 2.2 for new release

12-Feb-1988	HAULIN.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Get FOACND for texts, before branching off to their own
		code.

		situ, and it was impossible to delete all ACs from a text
		feature.

 8-Feb-1988	FLUCB.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Use a local copy of CBH, as this routine overwrites it
		before IFFBDY (by way of GETATT) uses it

 5-Feb-1988	TRANSF.SRC	- Ron Russell

		RESTORE.SRC 
		Undo what was done on 17-Dec.

18-Dec-1987	VALVAR.SRC	- Ron Russell
		Set $ACPRESENT correctly, when there are voids in the
		file. Always get the ACs into the AC sector

17-Dec-1987	RESTORE.SRC
		Throw away OPERATIONS, as they are in the same sector
		as REGIONS, whose sector are freed. In future, they
		should be in a sector by themselves, and would not

		Perform in-situ if possible

14-Dec-1987	CMN:STRIKE.CMN,OIIH.CMN		- Ron Russell
		Use LSL$CMNIFF:CB.STR to specify number of columns in
		arrays for CB data structures. A lot of .SRC files
		edited to include CB.STR to cope with this

14-Dec-1987	LOOPY.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		Does not now read all intermediate CBs. Check working!

12-Dec-1987	EXVERT,EXLINE.SRC	- Clarke Brunt

		attributes overflowed. Moan message is output at
		end of feature (either on read-in, or when new
		feature added). Not checked in HAULIN or GETVRT,
		but shouldn't happen in these unless INSITU editing,
		in which case one will have had the warning on read-in.

10-Dec-1987	PRIME.MAR			- Ron Russell
		SET, UNSET, PUT and GET now valid in CONSTRUCT state

 9-Dec-1987	DOREMO.SRC,NDEDIT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt
		REMOVE point from feature and EDIT [POINT] now operate
		in-situ on the workspace IFF file rather than creating
		a new feature. This should make them faster and use up
		less IFF disk space

 9-Dec-1987	EXVERT.SRC		- Clarke Brunt

		==========================================

 7-Dec-1987	various CB stuff		- Clarke Brunt
More CB stuff, hopefully no reference to ST's any more...
ENDSES,GETIFF,INPUT,OPENIF - set input revision level to 1 in all places
	an IFF file is opened (and remove calls to IFFIRV of yesterday).
	Also set read look-ahead in ENDSES for output (!!!)
DRAFTR,DRALAB,FLUFTR,GETCTX,INCTOT,LOOPY,TDYIFF - deal with CB's instead
	of ST's.

 7-Dec-1987	DOEXAM.SRC, etc	- Ron Russell
		New commands 
		EXAMINE POSITION
		EXAMINE ATTRIBUTE

 6-Dec-1987	various CB stuff		- Clarke Brunt
To preserve CB attributes and enable interrogation...
ADCORD - more arguments to add attributes as well as XY. Extra arguments
	 optional for now until added in all places
ADDATT - new routine called by ADCORD to add the attributes
ADDVRT - take advantage of new ADCORD
FIND   - use CB's. Sets IRVLEV. Scope to optimise find ends?
FLUCB  - new routine called by FLUSH to format and create a CB
FLUSH  - use new FLUCB
GETATT - general utility for separating CB's into XY, and other attrbutes.
	 Used by GETVRT,IFFBDY,HAULIN so far
GETVRT - Fill in RINATT, RIATTC, RIATTV (as well as RIXY). Sets IRVLEV
HAULIN - Fill in FONATT, FOATTC, FOATTV (as well as FOXY). Sets IRVLEV
IFFBDY - Load up attributes and use new ADCORD. Scope to read whole CB
	 directly into place (if SIMPLE) if we abandon dealing with
	 more than 200 points. Sets IRVLEV
Eventually input revision level will be set to 1 when the file is opened,
but only when all routines expect CBs. Possible to get problems at present
if a CB containing Z turns into a ZS which LITES2 doesn't understand.
This happens in FLUFTR for instance.

To prevent new 'LOST' IFF error causing collapses if attributes lost...
CLOSIF,ENDSES - do not treat IERCD='LOST' as fatal

To allow EDIT to operate in-situ (as an example of others to come)...
DOEND  - END INSERT now uses NDINSE, END EDIT uses new NDEDIT
NDEDIT - New routine to perform in-situ EDIT (Ron check FLG_GEOCHANGE)
NDINSE - The old NDEDIT. Remove the END EDIT stuff (and EDGING) eventually

CMN:STRIKE,OIIH - new attribute stuff added
CMN:CB - new block containing scratch CB
