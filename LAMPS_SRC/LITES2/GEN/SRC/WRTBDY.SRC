C Description
C
C    This function was designed for use by the program COMGEN, which
C is part of the LITES2 Command Interface. The purpose of the function
C is to write the main body of each of the output files.
C    The function returns true and an error message is output if an
C error occurs while the input file is being read, or while an output
C file is being selected or written.
