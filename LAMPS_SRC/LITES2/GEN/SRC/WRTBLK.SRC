C Description
C
C    This function was designed for use by the program COMGEN, which
C is part of the LITES2 Command Interface. The purpose of the function
C is to write blocks of text to the appropriate output files.
C    The function is passed the logical unit for writing, an array of
C character strings and the number of elements in that array. A message
C is output and the function returns true if an error occurs while
C selecting or writing to the output file.
