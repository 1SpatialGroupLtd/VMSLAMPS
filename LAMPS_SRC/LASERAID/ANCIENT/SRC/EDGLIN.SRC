C This routine is called after doing a scan vector.
C It takes the data from the digitiser, replaces any pairs of edges
C by line encounters and inserts the processed data
C into /RSE/ in such a way that subsequent calls to NEBIT
C will return encounters in the normal way.
C
C parameters:
***	PARAMETER/PARAMS/
C
C arguments:
	INTEGER IU,IV		! direction of scan
C
C common block:
***	COMMON/RSE/		! cleaned encounters go in here
C
C function:
	INTEGER   NEGET
C
C workspace:
	INTEGER   EDG,LSTEDG	! polarity of edges
	INTEGER   IBITS
	INTEGER   IW
	INTEGER   V1,V2
C
	REAL      VMEAN
C
C code:
	NEGOT = NEOLD
	LSTEDG=0
C
C get next encounter
10	NEGOT= NEGOT+1
	IF (NEGOT.GT.NESIZE) GOTO 70	! too many
	INE = NEGET(NEBUF(1,NEGOT),1)	! get one encounter
	IF (INE.GT.0) GOTO 20
	NEGOT=NEGOT-1
	GOTO 70	! finished
C
C here we have an encounter
20	IW = NEBUF(1,NEGOT).AND.NEGWID
	IF (IW .EQ. NEGNEG) GOTO 30	! -ve edge
	IF (IW .EQ. NEGPOS) GOTO 40	! +ve edge
C we have a line
	EDG=0
	GOTO 60		! get another
C edges
30	EDG = -1
	GOTO 50
40	EDG = 1
50	IBITS=NEBUF(1,NEGOT).AND.NEGMUL
	IF (IBITS.EQ.0) GOTO 60 	! first in scan
	IF (LSTEDG.EQ.0) GOTO 60 	! last encounter was line
	IF (LSTEDG.EQ.EDG) GOTO 60 	! shouldn't happen	!
C here with two successive edges to check for order
	V1=NEBUF(IV+1,NEGOT-1)
	V2=NEBUF(IV+1,NEGOT)
	IF ((V2.GT.V1).EQ.(IW.EQ.NEGPOS)) GOTO 60	! black hole
C merge the two edges to a line
	NEGOT=NEGOT-1
	VMEAN=(V1+V2)/2.0
	NEBUF(IV+1,NEGOT)=VMEAN + SIGN(0.5,VMEAN)
	NEBUF(1,NEGOT)=IABS(V2-V1).OR.(NEBUF(1,NEGOT).AND.NEGMUL)
	GOTO 10		! go get the next one
C
60	LSTEDG=EDG
	GOTO 10		! get the next
