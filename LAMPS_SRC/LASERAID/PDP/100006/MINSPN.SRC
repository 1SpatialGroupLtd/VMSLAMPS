C To create a minimum spanning tree from the points in
C /RSE/. The tree consists of points (NEBUF) connected
C by NODE & NXT. For point I :
C
C	NODE(I) = 0  -> this is the base point of a treee
C
C	NODE(I) > 0  -> point is in the tree, NODE(I) is the
C			next point in the tree
C
C	NODE(I) < 0  ->  point is outside the tree, -NODE(I)
C			is the nearest point in the tree
C
C		In the latter two cases, NXT(I) is the distance
C		to the next point.
