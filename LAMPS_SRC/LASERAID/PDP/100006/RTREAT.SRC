C To retreat from a difficulty so as to be able
C to have another run at it

	REAL ST(2)		! start of current scan vector

	INTEGER THIS(2),THAT(2)	! 2 points relative to ST
C
C get two points on the MP line
	CALL GTLST2(ST,10000.,IDLEN/2.0,N,THIS,THAT,M)
	IF (N .LT. 4) GOTO 90	! couldn't do it
C truncate the MP
	INDEX(1) = 0
	NMP(1) = M
C produce a scan centred on the funny
	IDNEW(X) = (THIS(X)-THAT(X))*2
	IDNEW(Y) = (THIS(Y)-THAT(Y))*2
	NST(X) = ST(X)+THAT(X)
	NST(Y) = ST(Y)+THAT(Y)
C that's all
