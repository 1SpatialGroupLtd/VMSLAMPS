	LOGICAL FUNCTION LINFIT(MBUF,IB,IT,IW,IU,IV,OFFNSS,A0,A1)
C
C Fits a line to the points held in MBUF between IB and IT
C with IU as the abcissa and IV as the ordinate
C ( or vice-versa ?)
C anyway IU is X and IV is Y
C and IW is the weight and a point is ignored
C completely and utterly if its weight is less than zero,
C otherwise it is weighted by a function of IW.
C
C The answer is returned in A1 and A0
C
C Result is .TRUE. if a line was fitted,
C          .FALSE. if one couldn't be

C We have now set up a set of simultaneous equations
