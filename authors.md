The references are some indication of how frequently they were identified as 
Author or modifier of code and is not overly reliable. 

This will be an incomplete and inaccurate list; Management, Support and
Sales are unlikely to be significantly represented. Some conflation of
names / initials has been made.

Note that Tim Bevan (TDCB) is not listed above and has not worked on this
codebase prior to preparing this repository.
