  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan Digitising Table Support software package (TABLE) is  assumed  by
  any  LSL  applications  software  package  which requires access to a digitising
  table.  Common examples would be the LITES2  map  display/editor,  or  the  TVES
  package matrix display utilities.

  It includes environment setup command files, library  support,  alternate  table
  decode routines, and a table monitor utility.

  The programs and libraries of the TABLE package are documented as  part  of  the
  various  application  packages  which  use  them.   In  particular,  the user is
  referred  to  the  MAPPING  package  documentation   for   general   environment
  information, notably the "LAMPS Environment Guide".



  2  [3m[1mFACILITIES[0m

  The following facilities are included in the TABLE package software.

       1.  The main component of TABLE is the Table Monitor program TABMON.   This
           runs  as  a  detached  process  and  can  handle  streamed input from a
           digitising table on a serial line.  The standard table supported is  an
           Altek table with AC40 or AC90 controller.  See below for facilities for
           alternative tables.

       2.  A utility STARTMON is provided to simplify  creation  of  the  detached
           process for TABMON.

       3.  Alternative table decode routines are provided.   These  allow  use  of
           serial  line digitising tables other than the standard Altek one.  They
           are provided as an example FORTRAN routine with a  procedure  to  allow
           building  of a modified version into a shared image, together with some
           pre-prepared shared images for common table types.  Currently  supplied
           are  routines  for  Altek,  CalComp  (three  different  formats), GTCO,
           Kontron (two different  formats),  Mutoh,  and  Summagraphics  formats.
           These shared images are then referenced by LSL applications programs if
           appropriate logical names are defined to point to them.

       4.  Example table decode routine sources are provided  in  Fortran  and  in
           Macro, for users to use as templates in writting their own decoders for
           non-standard tables.
