  1  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  DTMCONVERT is the Laser-Scan Digital  Terrain  Model  translation  package.   It
  contains utilities to convert data between the Laser-Scan DTI format and various
  other digital terrain model formats.  An interface to Laser-Scan IFF  format  is
  also provided.

  The DTI ([1mD[0migital [1mT[0merrain [1mI[0mmage) format is the standard raster matrix used by the
  3  Laser-Scan  DTM  packages  DTMPREPARE,  DTMCREATE  and  TVES  as  well as the
  background package MATRIX.  (See the appropriate SPS  for  details  on  each  of
  these).

  IFF ([1mI[0mnternal [1mF[0meature [1mF[0mormat) is the Laser-Scan vector file format generated  by
  Laser-Scan  digitising  systems  and  used  as the data structure throughout the
  Laser-Scan LAMPS system.

  The DTMCONVERT package operates on Digital Equipment  VAX  and  MicroVAX  series
  computers running the VMS operating system.  See below for hardware and software
  prerequisites.

  The utilities use either the Command  Line  Interpreter,  as  used  by  standard
  VAX/VMS utilities, or the Laser-Scan interactive command interface used by other
  LAMPS programs.  The latter provides interactive help  and  diagnostic  printout
  facilities.  Standard VMS format messages are generated by all the utilities.

  All  DTMCONVERT  modules  are  comprehensively  documented  in  the   DTMCONVERT
  Reference  Manual  and  the  documentation  includes  an explanation of messages
  output by the modules together with suggested user action.



  2  [1mHARDWARE[0m [1mPREREQUISITES[0m

  The following computer hardware requirements are needed to run DTMCONVERT.

        o  Any DEC VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation computer supported by  the  current
           version of VAX/VMS.

        o  At least 10MB available disk space for software,  plus  sufficient  for
           data files.

        o  At least a 4096 page working set per process is  needed  for  efficient
           operation of the larger utilities.

        o  Any DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal.

        o  Any DEC-supported magnetic tape or cartridge tape drive.

  3  [1mSOFTWARE[0m [1mPREREQUISITES[0m

  DTMCONVERT utilities run  under  VAX/VMS  Version  5.4-3  (or  higher,  assuming
  upwards  compatibility  by  DEC)  concurrently  with other interactive and batch
  processes.

  The utilities are standalone conversion programs but  the  package  "MATRIX"  is
  necessary  for  manipulation  of  DTI  files and Laser-Scan's [1mI[0mFF [1mM[0map [1mP[0mrocessing
  package (IMP) for IFF files.  For  more  advanced  DTM  processing  the  [1mT[0merrain
  [1mV[0misualisation and [1mE[0mxploitation [1mS[0moftware (TVES) package is recommended.



  4  [1mGROWTH[0m [1mCONSIDERATIONS[0m

  The minimum hardware and software requirements for any future  version  of  this
  product may be different from the minimum hardware and software requirements for
  the current version.




  5  [1mSUPPORT[0m [1mLEVEL[0m

  All modules of the DTMCONVERT package are fully  supported  Laser-Scan  standard
  software products.



  6  [1mFACILITIES[0m

  The facilities offered by the DTMCONVERT utilities are described  below  in  the
  order  they  appear  in  the  Reference  Manual.   Note  that customers purchase
  particular modules as required, so that the presence of  a  module  within  this
  list does not mean that a customer will automatically receive that module.



  [1m DTI2DTED[0m [1mand[0m [1mDTED2DTI[0m

          These two programs provide  an  interface  between  the  Laser-Scan  DTI
          format  and the United Statest Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) Digital Land
          Mass Simulation (DLMS) Digital Terrain  Elevation  Data  (DTED)  format.
          Both utilities are command driven and hence provide on-line help and the
          facility to display diagnostic messages.

           o  DTI2DTED - reads a disc file containing a DTI matrix and converts it
              to  a  DMA  DLMS  DTED  magnetic  tape.  Commands are entered at the
              prompt DTI2DTED>.

           o  DTED2DTI - reads a DMA DLMS DTED magnetic tape and converts it  into
              a DTI disc file.  Commands are entered at the prompt DTED2DTI>

  [1m DTI2NTF[0m [1mand[0m [1mNTF2DTI[0m

          These two programs provide  an  interface  between  the  Laser-Scan  DTI
          format and the UK National Transfer Format at release 1.0 level 0, or at
          a subset of level 4 used by the Ordnance Survey (UK) for terrain models.
          NTFD2DTI  can  also  convert  release 1.1 NTF (at both level 0 and 4) to
          DTI.  Both utilities are command driven and hence provide  on-line  help
          and the facility to display diagnostic messages.

           o  DTI2NTF - reads a disc file containing a DTI matrix and converts  it
              to  a  UK  National  Transfer  Format  magnetic tape or disc file at
              release 1.0 with fixed length records.  The program is invoked  with
              the  command  DTI2NTF and various command qualifiers are provided to
              control the conversion.

           o  NTF2DTI - This utility provides a means of converting a raster image
              on  a  UK National Transfer Format magnetic tape or disc file into a
              DTI disc file.  It will  convert  both  version  1.0  (fixed  length
              record)  and  version 1.1 (variable length record) NTF files to DTI.
              The program is invoked with the command NTF2DTI and various  command
              qualifiers are provided to control the conversion.




  [1m DTEDIFF[0m

          This is a single utility designed  to  transfer  [1mD[0mata[1mS[0met  [1mI[0mdentification
          (DSI)  and  Accuracy (ACC) records between a DTED DTI format file and an
          IFF file.  The program  is  invoked  by  the  command  DTEDIFF  and  the
          direction of the transfer is determined by the qualifier /MERGE.



  [1m IIS2DTI[0m [1mand[0m [1mDTI2IIS[0m

          These two utilities convert between an  [1mI[0mnternational  [1mI[0mmaging  [1mS[0mystem's
          (IIS) system 500 raster format and a Laser-Scan DTI format file.

           o  IIS2DTI - converts from a IIS system 500 format to a DTI file and is
              invoked  by the command IIS2DTI.  Command qualifiers are provided to
              control the type of data being translated.  IIS2DTI may also convert
              an  extension  of the usual 500 format supported here, consisting of
              scanlines across the dataset (with the record length being equal  to
              the number of columns).

           o  DTI2IIS - converts from a DTI file to the  IIS  system  500  format.
              The command qualifiers are identical to IIS2DTI.

  [1m DEM2DTI[0m [1mand[0m [1mDTI2DEM[0m

          These programs interface between the  United  States  Geological  Survey
          (USGS)  Digital  Elevation  Model  (DEM)  format  and the Laser-Scan DTI
          matrix format.  Both 7.5-minute (1:24000 scale) and 1-degree  (1:250000)
          DEM's are supported and all DTI header types can be written or read.

           o  DEM2DTI - reads a DEM either from disk or tape and writes  it  to  a
              DTI  disk  file.   The program is invoked by the command DEM2DTI and
              several command qualfiers are provided to control the translation.

           o  DTI2DEM - reads a DTI from disk and translates it  to  a  7.5-minute
              coverage  DEM  which  can  be  written  either to disk or tape.  The
              command DTI2DEM invokes the program and qualifiers are  provided  to
              control the translation.




  [1m MNT2DTI[0m

          This utility provides a means of converting an  IGN  (France)  MNT  file
          from  disk  or  tape  and  writes it to a DTI disk file.  The program is
          invoked by  the  command  MNT2DTI  and  several  command  qualfiers  are
          provided to control the translation.
