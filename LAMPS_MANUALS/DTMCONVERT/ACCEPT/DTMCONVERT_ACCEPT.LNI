  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan Package
  DTMCONVERT DTED.

  DTMCONVERT DTED consists of three utilities to allow transfer of data between  a
  DTED magnetic tape format and Laser-Scan DTI and IFF disk formats.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserve the right  to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.



  2  [1mOverview[0m

  For the purpose of acceptance, two initial disk files will be supplied:

      (a)  A disk file in Laser-Scan DTI format, containing DTED elevation data.

      (b)  A disk file in Laser-Scan IFF format, containing DTED Header (DSI)  and
           Accuracy (ACC) data.

  During the acceptance procedure, these initial files will  be  read  and  merged
  using  the DTMCONVERT module DTEDIFF.  This source DTI file is then converted to
  DTED offline format on magtape, using DTMCONVERT module DTI2DTED.

  The resultant DTED tape will then be read back to a second disk DTI  file  using
  DTED2DTI.   The matrix data in the resultant DTI file will then be compared with
  the source DTI data using the DTICOMBINE utility of the MATRIX package.

  The utility DTEDIFF will be used again to extract the ACC accuracy subregion and
  header  information  from the resultant DTI file into an IFF file.  This file is
  compared with the initial IFF file using the  IDIFFERENCE  utility  of  the  IMP
  package.

  Acceptance will be performed using a supplied DCL command  procedure  to  invoke
  the required modules.

  Check  that  the  Laser-Scan-supplied  package   initialisation   command   file
  LSL$COM:DTMCONVERTINI.COM  has  been  invoked.   This  has  probably  been  done
  automatically on your behalf at login time.  A good check  is  to  use  the  DCL
  command:

          $ SHOW SYMBOL DTI2DTED

  to verify that the DCL symbol DTI2DTED exists and points to  the  program  image
  file  of a main DTMCONVERT module "LSL$EXE:DTI2DTED.EXE".  If symbol DTI2DTED is
  not defined then invoke the package initialisation command file  by  giving  the
  DCL command:

          $ @LSL$COM:DTMCONVERTINI

  then repeat the check for the existence of DCL symbol DTI2DTED.

  Use the DCL SHOW LOGICAL command to ensure that logical name LSL$DTI points to a
  suitable  working  directory  to receive the acceptance test DTI files.  If not,
  then use the the DCL DEFINE command to set LSL$DTI appropriately.

  Use the DCL SHOW LOGICAL command to ensure that logical name LSL$IF points to  a
  suitable  working  directory  to receive the acceptance test IFF files.  If not,
  then use the SI utility to set LSL$IF appropriately.

  The acceptance test command procedure  will  check  for  the  existence  of  the
  required  acceptance  test data files in their usual directory on the Laser-Scan
  software  distribution  directory  tree.   It  will  set  up  a   logical   name
  LSL$DTMCONVERT_ACCEPT to point to this directory.  It will also copy the initial
  DTI data file into the working directory pointed at by LSL$DTI, and the  initial
  IFF data file into the working directory pointed at by LSL$IF.

  Invoke the acceptance test command procedure by giving the DCL command

          $ @LSL$COM:DTMCONVERT_ACCEPT



  5  [1mDescription of Acceptance Procedure[0m

  The acceptance procedure will ask for the device name of a magtape drive  to  be
  used.   The  device  name  must  be  given,  including the final ":".  A scratch
  magtape must be available on this device,  without  write  protection.   Do  not
  mount or allocate this device in advance.

  The acceptance procedure will copy the initial DTI and IFF files containing DTED
  elevation data to working directories.  This checks the validity of the software
  environment including logical names.   Note  the  messages  from  the  DCL  COPY
  utility indicating successful copy.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Phase 1:  The DTMCONVERT module DTEDIFF will be used to extract the ACC accuracy
  subregion and header information from the initial IFF file and merge it into the
  source DTI file.   Observe  the  messages  from  DTEDIFF  showing  progress  and
  successful completion.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Phase 2:  The DTMCONVERT module DTI2DTED will then be used to convert the source
  DTI file to a DTED magtape.  Observe the messages from DTI2DTED showing progress
  and successful completion.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Phase 3:  The resultant DTED tape will then be read back to a resultant disk DTI
  file  using  the  module  DTED2DTI.   Observe the messages from DTED2DTI showing
  progress and 100% completion.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Phase 4:  The source and resultant DTI files will then  be  compared  using  the
  DTICOMBINE  utility  of  the  MATRIX  package.   This  procedure will generate a
  further DTI file whose height values will all be  zero  if  the  two  files  are
  identical.  Observe the message from DTICOMBINE indicating:

          Value Range :  unset

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Phase 5:  The utility DTEDIFF will be used again to  extract  the  ACC  accuracy
  subregion  and  header  information from the resultant DTI file into a resultant
  IFF file.  Observe the messages from DTEDIFF  showing  progress  and  successful
  completion.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Phase 6:  The initial and resultant IFF files are compared using the IDIFFERENCE
  utility  of  the  IMP  package.   The only differences recorded should be in the
  header information, such as the NS entry which contains the date of  generation,
  and the HI entry holding file history.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m
