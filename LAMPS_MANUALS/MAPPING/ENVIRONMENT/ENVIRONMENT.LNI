  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  Laser-Scan LAMPS is a combination of  hardware  and  software  components  which
  together  allow  use  of  modern  high  performance  DEC  VAX  minicomputers and
  worksystems for digital cartography and automated map production.

  Laser-Scan GIS software (HORIZON for Environmental systems  and  METROPOLIS  for
  land information), uses the same LAMPS components with some extra software (XGIS
  ) to provide facilities for geographic query  and  update.   In  the  discussion
  which  follows,  both  map  production and GIS systems will often be referred to
  collectively as "LAMPS".

  LAMPS and GIS systems may vary in size considerably.  At the bottom  end,  there
  may  be  just  a  single editing workstation, running the "Basic LAMPS" software
  packages.  At the top end it may be a a large system using multiple networked or
  clustered  computers  running  many automated data capture, manual data capture,
  editing, processing, check plotting, conversion,  update,  final  plotting,  and
  query tasks on a variety of workstations and terminals.

  Laser-Scan may provide a complete  hardware/software  turnkey  system,  together
  with  continuing  full system support, including VMS support.  Alternatively, in
  some cases Laser-Scan provide just  software  to  complement  existing  customer
  hardware.

  In either case there will usually be someone on-site with responsibility for the
  smooth  running  of  the  LAMPS  system, and the information in the rest of this
  document should help him or her achieve an overview of the system.

  2  [1mHardware[0m [1mComponents[0m

  The central hardware component of a LAMPS system will be one or more DEC VAX  or
  MicroVAX  series  computers,  with  associated disk, magtape, communications and
  terminal peripherals.  The other hardware components of the system  will  depend
  on the software options selected, but may include one or more of the following.

        o  A Lasertrak is a vector scanning digitiser which can also be used as  a
           large screen display and 105mm diazo microfilm plotter.  A Lasertrak is
           connected to the host computer via the UNIBUS, which is a fast parallel
           interface.   There is an LSL-supplied device driver (HRDRIVER) for this
           device.  In the case of a MicroVAX,  a  QBUS  to  UNIBUS  converter  is
           required.   The  Lasertrak  console  includes a colour graphics display
           (normally a Tektronix 4105) for use as both a VMS terminal, and closeup
           graphics  display screen.  This terminal is connected via a serial line
           to the host computer.

        o  A FASTRAK is an earlier version of the Lasertrak,  having  a  different
           console  incorporating  a  monochrome  graphics  storage  tube  display
           (Tektronix 4010) in place of the 4105.

        o  An HRD-1 is a simplified FASTRAK  or  Lasertrak  without  the  scanning
           capabilities.

        o  A Laserplot is a microprocessor-controlled laser plotter  designed  for
           cartographic  quality  vector output on approximately A3 size film.  It
           is connected to the host computer via a serial line.

        o  A Laser-Scan Digitising Table is a manual digitising table  with  a  16
           button  cursor and serial line controller.  Currently this is likely to
           be an Altek table with either  an  AC90  or  AC40  controller.   It  is
           connected  to  the host computer or workstation controller via a serial
           line.  Other manufacturer's tables may  be  acceptable,  possibly  with
           reduced functionality.

        o  A Laser-Scan Vector Graphics display can be one of the following types:

            -  A Laser-Scan GKS Segment  Storage  Display  is  a  high  resolution
               device  capable  of  storage  and  display  of  vector  (lines  and
               symbols), text, and fill area data.  A typical example would  be  a
               Sigmex  6164  which  is a 1000 line colour display, and a member of
               the Sigmex 6000 series of GKS compatible graphics devices.  It  has
               a large internal segment store and can hence do local zoom and pan.
               It is connected to the host computer via a serial line.

            -  A Laser-Scan Basic Vector Display is a medium  to  high  resolution
               device capable of display of vector (lines, symbols and text) data,
               and having a limited refresh capability.  A typical  example  would
               be a Tektronix 4014 DVST.  It is connected to the host computer via
               a serial line.


        o  A Laser-Scan Raster Graphics Display is a high resolution (1000+  line)
           device  capable  of  display  of  both vector (line) and raster (pixel)
           data.  A typical example would be a Sigmex ARGS 7000  graphics  system,
           which  is connected to the host computer via a DR11-like 16bit parallel

           interface on the UNIBUS, and requires  an  LSL-supplied  device  driver
           (IDDRIVER).

        o  A Laser-Scan MUART or WOSP workstation is a general  purpose  graphical
           editing  station  consisting  of  a Laser-Scan Vector Graphics display,
           possibly a small menu tablet, an Altek digitising table, and possibly a
           DEC  alphanumeric  VDU  terminal.   These  devices  are  connected to a
           Laser-Scan MUART  (TMU)  intelligent  graphics  controller/multiplexer,
           which communicates with the host computer via a single serial line.

        o  A Laser-Scan Windowing Graphics Workstation is a high resolution  (1000
           line)  device  capable  of  display  of  both  vector (line) and raster
           (pixel) data in multiple windows on a closely coupled bitmapped screen.
           The  workstation  has  integral  VAX  processor, memory, disk, magtape,
           mouse etc.  A typical example would  be  a  DEC  VAXstation  4000.   It
           provides  the  functionality of the Laser-Scan Vector Graphics display,
           and some of the functionality of a Laser-Scan Raster Graphics  display,
           together with a responsive interaction environment.

  A LAMPS system consists of both  hardware  and  software  components.   Software
  components  are  grouped  by  function into packages, which may be either single
  programs or collections of individual  utilities.   For  a  description  of  the
  contents  of  each  package,  and its hardware and software requirements, please
  refer to its Software Product Specification  (SPS),  available  separately  from
  Laser-Scan.   The  following  is  a list of major software components with their
  major hardware dependencies.


  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  3.1  [1mLAMPS[0m [1mKernel[0m [1mPackages[0m


        o  The Laser-Scan system software support package (LSLSYSTEM) is  required
           by  all LSL software components.  It includes environment setup command
           files, supplementary system utilities, and utility programs  needed  by
           more than one package.

        o  The Laser-Scan Mapping Kernel Software package (MAPPING) is required by
           all  other  LAMPS  software  components.   It  includes  the  IFF  file
           interface  library  (IFFLIB),  the   Feature   Representation   library
           (FRTLIB),  as  well as various central LAMPS initialisation and control
           procedures.

            -  The IFF file format is central to all LAMPS components.  All  LAMPS
               software  reads  and writes digital cartographic information as IFF
               files.  The  IFFLIB  library  is  supplied  to  allow  user-written
               programs to access IFF files.

            -  The FRT (Feature Representation Table) lookup  system  is  used  by
               several  LAMPS components.  Any LAMPS program requiring to know the
               graphic representation of an IFF feature will use FRTLIB to  access
               information  about  feature  type,  colour,  shape, size, etc.  The
               FRTLIB library is supplied to allow user-written programs to access
               FRT files.


        o  Laser-Scan maintenance utilities package  (LSLMAINT)  includes  various
           utilities  and  libraries needed by LSL for maintenance and development

  Most programs read and/or write disk  data  files  and  terminals  during  their
  operation.   For reasons of simplicity, flexibility, and economy, all Laser-Scan
  programs carry out these accesses via "logical names" rather than  via  embedded
  device  names,  or  default or fixed directories.  This means that the user need
  not be concerned with current default directory etc, and there  is  no  need  to
  copy  or duplicate files.  These logical names usually have the form LSL$name or
  LSL_name to avoid conflict with DEC or other manufacturer's products.

  4.2  [1mFiles[0m [1mand[0m [1mDirectories[0m

  The files involved in the LAMPS system can be divided firstly into program files
  and data files.  Program files are supplied by Laser-Scan, while most data files
  are transient.  A series of logical names is provided  by  Laser-Scan  to  allow
  easy access to LAMPS files and directories.  These are described below.

  There have been a variety of directory layouts  on  Laser-Scan  systems  in  the
  past,  but  all  future LAMPS systems should use the following conventions.  All
  Laser-Scan files should now be contained on five  (occasionally  six)  directory
  trees, as follows:

        o  LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT                contains all LSL-distributed software.

           This tree  is  usually  [LSLPUBLIC...],  and  contains  the  definitive
           versions  of  LSL-issued  software.  It may be write-protected on site,
           and need only be written  to  to  install  new  releases  of  software.
           Example directories on it might include:

           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[LITES2.EXE]   executable images for LITES2
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[LITES2.HELP]  help files for LITES2
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[LITES2.COM]   command files for LITES2
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[IMP.EXE]      executable images for IMP

        o  LSL$SITE_ROOT                  contains all site-dependent files.

           This tree is usually [LSLSITE...],  and  contains  copies  of  standard
           files  which  need  to  change from site to site.  This includes static
           data files, lookup files,  and  possible  tailored  copies  of  command
           procedures  from  the  public  tree.   Example  directories on it might
           include:

           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.COM]        tailored command procedures
           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LITES2.CMD]     .LCM command files for LITES2
           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[HRD.LOOKUP]     HRD system constants (LDSY21) files

        o  LSL$DATA_ROOT                  contains user data files.

           This tree is usually [LSLDATA...], and contains user data files such as

           IFF files and DTI files.  Example directories on it might include:

           LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.IFF]        IFF map data files
           LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.DTI]        DTI matrix data files

        o  LSL$USER_ROOT                  contains all user home directories .

           This tree is usually [LSLUSER...], and contains  home  directories  and
           personal  files  for  LAMPS  users.   Example  directories  on it might
           include:

           LSL$USER_ROOT:[LSLUSER]        home directory for template LAMPS user

           On sites which have pre-existing conventions for user home directories,
           this tree may be empty.

        o  LSL$LOCAL_ROOT         contains all node-specific files.

           This tree is usually [LSLLOCAL...], and contains workspace files  which
           should  be  local  to a particular node of a VAXcluster.  This includes
           LITES2 workspace and journal files.  Example directories  on  it  might
           include:

           LSL$LOCAL_ROOT:[LITES2.JNL]    journal files for LITES2
           LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LITES2.WORK]    workspace files for LITES2

        o  LSL$SOURCE_ROOT                        contains any Laser-Scan  program
           sources

           This tree is not usually present on site,  but  if  it  exists,  it  is
           usually  [LSLSOURCE...],  and  contains any Laser-Scan program sources.
           These are often only present for customer-specific programs.

  The files can be further categorised as follows.

        o  Program executable image files.  These are the definitive copies of the
           programs  making  up the LAMPS suite.  All the Laser-Scan user programs
           are contained in a directory tree pointed at by  LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT.   The
           exact  location  of  the  program  on  the tree need not be known, as a
           logical name LSL$EXE is provided as a search list running  through  all
           the relevant branches of this "public tree".

        o  Command procedure files.  These are DCL  procedures  for  carrying  out
           housekeeping  functions,  and running certain LAMPS programs.  Like the
           image files, these are kept on the "public tree".  The  exact  location
           of  the  command  file  on the tree need not be known as a logical name
           LSL$COM is provided as a search list running through all  the  relevant
           tree branches.

        o  Help files.  These are files containing on-line  help  information  for
           certain  LAMPS  programs.   Like the image files, these are kept on the
           "public tree".  The exact location of the help file on  the  tree  need
           not  be  known  as a logical name LSL$HELP is provided as a search list
           running through all the relevant tree branches.

        o  Program source files.  These are the component parts of those  programs
           which can be recompiled on site (if any), including standard libraries.
           These  files  are  resident  in  a  directory  tree   pointed   at   by
           LSL$SOURCE_ROOT.

        o  IFF map data files.  These are the maps in  digital  form,  created  by
           digitising  or input (eg from magnetic tape for editing).  Depending on
           the application, they may be kept, or  output  from  the  system  to  a
           databank.   These  are  usually resident on the LSL$DATA_ROOT directory
           tree and are pointed at by the logical name LSL$IF.

        o  DTI raster data files.  These are eg terrain models  in  digital  form,
           created  by  DTM  modelling,  or  input eg from magtape for display and
           manipulation.  Depending on the  application,  they  may  be  kept,  or
           output  from  the  system to a databank.  These are usually resident on
           the LSL$DATA_ROOT directory tree.

        o  Static data files.  These are files containing  subsidiary  information
           necessary for the running of certain programs.  An example would be the
           FRT files which determine  the  graphical  representation  of  features
           according  to  their  feature codes.  These are usually resident on the
           LSL$SITE_ROOT directory tree, and are pointed at by logical  names,  eg
           LSL$FRT.

        o  Workspace files.  These are files containing temporary copies  of  data
           while   programs   are   running.    They  reside  temporarily  on  the
           LSL$LOCAL_ROOT directory tree.

  As described above, logical name search lists are provided to obviate  the  need
  for  ordinary  users  to know the precise location on the public tree of program

  LSL$COM, LSL$HELP, and LSL$LOOKUP.

  Taking LSL$EXE as an example, on a minimal LAMPS system with packages LSLSYSTEM,
  MAPPING,  IMP,  LITES2, PLOTTING, SIGMA and TABLE, the logical name LSL$EXE must

  It is recommended that it also include as the first translation the directory:

          LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.EXE]

  in which testing or modified releases of software can be placed so that they get
  taken in preference to the public tree "standard" version.

  Similarly  LSL$COM,  LSL$HELP,  and  LSL$LOOKUP  should   pass   first   through
  directories  [LSL.COM], [LSL.HELP] and [LSL.LOOKUP] on LSL$SITE_ROOT.  These can
  then be used for modified command procedures, help files  and  lookup  files  to
  avoid changing the standard versions on the public tree.

  At sites which have been installed using the LSLINSTALL  automated  installation
  procedure  (see below), a file containing the definitions for these search lists
  will   automatically   have   been   generated   using   a   procedure    called
  LSLSEARCHLISTS_GENERATE.COM  which is supplied as part of the LSLSYSTEM package.
  This procedure can be re-run while logged on as user SYSTEM  to  regenerate  the
  file  which  will  be called LSDEFNSSEARCHLISTS.COM and live in the SYS$MANAGER:
  directory.

  Conventionally, each user of the system has their own username and password,  so
  that  a  record  is  kept  in  the  accounting  system  of  resources used.  All
  Laser-Scan programs may be run by any authorised user of the system, and do  not
  require  the use of any particular username.  It is however conventional to have
  a captive user CONTROL to run the DCL procedure which administrates  the  DIGSYS
  control process, and a user VTRAK to run the VTRAK vector digitising package.

  All users of the LAMPS system must be allocated User Identifier Codes (UICs)  in
  the  same group (usually 100) so that they have group privileges with respect to
  one another.  This allows files created by one user to be edited by another, and
  allows  inter-process  synchronisation for eg DIGSYS via group-wide common event
  flags.

  Note that in the production flowline  situation,  many  users  are  involved  in
  progressing a map through the various stages of digitising, editing, processing,
  plotting,  validating  etc.   Hence  it  is  particularly  important  that  file
  protections do not interfere with this sharing of data.

  It is normal to reserve UICs [100,1] to [100,10] inclusive for  Laser-Scan  use,
  particularly for hardware and software maintenance, and if so then the following
  usernames are also reserved.

        o  The LSLSOFT user is required to be the owner of all LAMPS programs, and
           will have been created using AUTHORIZE as follows:

           UIC=[100,2], username=LSLSOFT, owner="LSL Software",
                  account=LSL, directory=[LSLSOFT], device=LSL$SITE_ROOT:,
                  privileges=(GROUP,TMPMBX,NETMBX)

        o  If there is LSL-maintained hardware installed as part of the system  it
           is conventional to have an LSL engineer's account as follows:

           UIC=[100,3], username=LSLENG, owner="LSL Service",
                  account=LSL, directory=[LSLENG], device=LSL$SITE_ROOT:
                  privileges=(GROUP,TMPMBX,NETMBX)

        o  Where  there  will  be  continued  LSL  consultancy   support   it   is
           conventional to have an LSL liaison officer's account as follows:

           UIC=[100,4], username=LSLLIAISON, owner="LSL Consultancy",
                  account=LSL, directory=[LSLLIAISON], device=LSL$SITE_ROOT:
                  privileges=(GROUP,TMPMBX,NETMBX)

        o  A typical template LSL user account should also have  been  created  as
           follows:

           UIC=[100,100], username=LSLUSER, owner="LSL LAMPS user",
                  account=LSL, directory=[LSLUSER], device=LSL$USER_ROOT:
                  privileges=(GROUP,TMPMBX,NETMBX)

        o  If any of the LAMPS Matrix packages (eg DTMCREATE), or the STRUCTURE or
           POLYGONS  packages  are to be used, then a user is needed with enhanced
           quotas to allow use of these programs.  A template "big"  user  account
           should then be created as follows:

           UIC=[100,101], username=LSLBIG, owner="LSL LAMPS big user",
                  account=LSL, directory=[LSLUSER], device=LSL$USER_ROOT:,

  5.1  [1mPackage[0m [1mInitialisation[0m

  All the symbols and logical names required to run LAMPS programs can be  set  up
  by  a  series  of command procedures available on LSL$COM - a general Laser-Scan
  one,  and  one  for  each  package.   The  default  action   of   each   package
  initialisation  procedure is to set up all symbols, and all logical names in the
  process logical name table.

  Some packages support definition of their logical names at  VMS  system  startup
  (bootstrap)  time.   If  an optional argument SYSTEM or GROUP is given to such a
  procedure, then it will only define the logical names, and will  do  it  in  the
  given  logical  name table (system or group).  Note that while duplicated effort
  can be avoided by defining logical names system-wide  at  system  startup  time,
  symbols can only be defined on a per-process basis.

  Generally, if logical names are already set up  when  a  package  initialisation
  procedure is invoked, they will not be overwritten.

  The package initialisation procedure must be executed before running any of  the
  programs  of  that  package,  and  this is normally done in one of the following
  ways.

       1.  Explicit invocation of each package  initialisation  procedure  as  and
           when  needed  before use of the package.  This method is rare, and only
           relevant when users only occasionally require LAMPS software.

       2.  Automatic invocation of relevant package initialisation  procedures  at
           login time by means of commands in each user's private LOGIN.COM file.

       3.  Automatic invocation of all package initialisation procedures at  login
           time by means of commands in a central login command file using the DEC
           SYS$SYLOGIN mechanisms.  This is the most usual approach.

       4.  Automatic invocation of all package initialisation procedures in SYSTEM
           mode  at  system  startup  time  by means of commands in the Laser-Scan
           startup files which are called from the DEC system startup command file
           SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM.   This  can  only  set up logical names, not
           symbols, so is usually combined with (3) or (2) above.

  LAMPS software is normally issued as DEC BACKUP  savesets  on  either  1/2  inch
  1600bpi  industry standard magtape, or on DEC TK50 cartridge tape.  Each package
  is a normally a single saveset with the saveset name the  same  as  the  package
  name.   In some cases, there will be a second saveset for a package, with a name
  having "_2" appended to the package name, eg LITES2_2.

  A command procedure LSLINSTALL.COM is provided as part of the basic  LSL  system
  support  package  LSLSYSTEM  to  carry  out  the  main  steps  in LAMPS software
  installation.  The procedure has built in help.  However, as it is part  of  the
  software  it  is  intended to install, some degree of manual bootstrapping is of
  course required.

  There is a separate document, the "LSL LAMPS Software Installation Guide"  which
  explains  the  installation procedure in some detail, and the reader is referred
  to this document for further information.

  All DEC standard software including VMS should be  kept  up  to  date  with  new
  releases  as  issued  by  DEC,  using the DEC-supplied procedures.  See the "VMS
  Software Installation Guide" for details.

  Laser-Scan will issue periodic new releases of software components to  customers
  with software maintenance contracts.  New releases of software may take the form
  of complete packages in the same  form  as  for  an  initial  installation  (see
  above),  or  of  particular  package  components.   In  either  case,  the usual
  distribution medium is BACKUP savesets on 1600bpi 1/2 inch magtape  or  on  TK50
  cartridge.

  These new releases should be  placed  on  the  appropriate  directories  on  the
  LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT  public  directory  tree.   There  is  a procedure LSLUPDATE.COM
  available on the LSL$COM search list which automates the  steps  in  reading  an
  update  tape  onto  a temporary directory tree, reporting its contents, checking
  for conflicts, merging the temporary tree with the public tree, and clearing  up
  afterwards.  The LSLUPDATE procedure has an inbuilt help facility, and the steps
  involved are

        o  PREPARE -
           Prepare the update directory tree and set up the  rooted  logical  name
           and  empty  directory tree used to hold the updating files prior to the
           merge stage.  This command must be given before LOAD, MERGE,  or  TIDY.
           It will delete any existing files from a previous failed update.

        o  LOAD -
           Load the BACKUP savesets  containing  the  software  updates  onto  the
           temporary tree.

        o  DIRECTORY -
           Give a directory listing of the update files now on the temporary tree.

        o  CHECK-
           Check  the  update  files  now  on  the  temporary  tree  to   see   if
           site-specific  versions  exist  on  LSL$SITE_ROOT.  If so, give warning
           messages and advice about resolving any possible conflicts.

        o  MERGE -
           Merge the update files onto the main public  tree.   Before  doing  the
           merge,  the procedure checks for any package-specific update procedures
           supplied as part of this release, and if any are found then it  invokes
           them.   It  then creates any directories needed on LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT, and
           renames the files from the temporary tree into their permanent homes.

        o  TIDY -
           Tidy up after update, eg by purging the public tree.  Note that if  any
           LSL  images are installed, INSTALL/REPLACE should be used or the system
           must be rebooted before the tidy phase.


  If you have an update to install, and (for some strange reason) have not yet got
  the LSLUPDATE procedure currently on your public tree, then you can bootstrap it
  from the release tape as follows:

          Logon as LSLSOFT, and mount the distribution tape (assumed below to be a
          TK50  cartridge  MUA0:)  as  /FOREIGN.   Then  use  BACKUP  to  read the
          LSLUPDATE file from the tape using lines such as:

          $ MOUNT MUA0:/FOREIGN
          $ BACKUP MUA0:/REWIND/SELECT=LSLUPDATE.COM LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[*...]/LOG
          $ DISMOUNT MUA0:/NOUNLOAD

  [1mNOTES[0m

       1.  If LSLUPDATE is used to install a Laser-Scan software package which  is
           not  currently installed on this computer, then it will be necessary to
           edit the system startup file which sets up the logical name definitions
           to  include  the  newly created package directories.  These definitions
           may  be  in  files  LSDEFNS.COM  or  LSDEFNS_SEARCHLISTS.COM   in   the
           SYS$MANAGER   directory.    If   the   existing   definitions   are  in
           LSDEFNS_SEARCHLISTS.COM, then see the section above on  "Search  Lists"
           for how to automatically regenerate this file.

       2.  If a new package is being installed, it will also be necessary to  edit
           the  Laser-Scan  login  definitions  file  (LSLOGIN.COM)  to invoke the
           appropriate package initialisation file eg LSL$COM:STRUCTUREINI.COM.

       3.  If LSLUPDATE is used to install changed or new programs  which  require
           environment  additions such as new logical names, then it will again be
           necessary to edit the system startup files.

       4.  These changes are not necessary in the normal case where  LSLUPDATE  is
           being used to install minor updates to an existing package.

  The Laser-Scan system software support package (LSLSYSTEM) is  required  by  all
  LSL   software   components.   It  includes  environment  setup  command  files,
  supplementary system utilities, and utility programs needed  by  more  than  one
  package.   Its  environment requirements are also needed for all LAMPS packages,
  and are described below.

        o  SYS$INPUT points to the terminal to be used for command input.

        o  LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT points to the disk and directory which is the root  for
           the  public tree of Laser-Scan standard software.  This will usually be
           'lsldisk':[LSLPUBLIC.], where 'lsldisk' is the  device  containing  the
           Laser-Scan public and site directory trees, eg DUA0:.

        o  LSL$SITE_ROOT points to the disk and directory which is  the  root  for
           the   tree   of   all  site-dependent  files.   This  will  usually  be

           the    tree    of    user   data   files.    This   will   usually   be
           'lsldatadisk':[LSLDATA.] where 'lsldatadisk' is the  device  containing
           the Laser-Scan data directory trees eg DUA1:.

        o  LSL$LIBRARY is a search list running  through  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.LIB],
           then through all public tree .LIB directories.

        o  LSL$LOOKUP is a search list running through LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP],
           then through all public tree .LOOKUP directories.

        o  LSL$LSLSHR points to the file  containing  a  shared  image  of  LSLLIB

  The Laser-Scan Mapping Kernel Software package  (MAPPING)  is  required  by  all
  other  LAMPS  software  components.   It includes the IFF file interface library
  (IFFLIB), the Feature  Representation  library  (FRTLIB),  as  well  as  various
  central LAMPS initialisation and control procedures.

  Its environment requirements are also needed for all  LAMPS  packages,  and  are
  described below.

        o  LSL$IF points to the disk and directory to contain  the  IFF  map  data
           files    to    be    processed.     This    may    for    example    be
           LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.IFF].  Note that a utility SI is provided  to  allow
           easy  reassignment of the LSL$IF:  logical name.  SI will also upkeep a
           second logical name IF which is supplied for compatibility with earlier
           PDP11/RSX systems.

        o  LSL$FRT points to a directory in which FRTLIB expects to find FRT, SRI,
           and  TRI  files  (feature  representation files).  This will usually be
           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.FRT]

        o  LSL$LOOKUP search list must include the disk and directory containing a
           valid AC skeleton definitions file if utility ISELAC is to be used.

        o  LSL$HELP points to a directory in which IMP expects to find its  online
           help  file  (IMP.HLB).   This  will  normally  be a search list passing
           through LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[IMP.HELP].  The same help file may also be set
           up  as  a  supplementary  DCL  help  file using the VMS HLP$LIBRARY_'n'
           mechanisms.  This allows access to IMP help information  from  the  DCL
           level.  See the VMS documentation for details of help libraries.

        o  LSL$LITES2ROUTINES points to the full file specification of a shareable
           image  containing  the  LITES2  user  routines.   This  will usually be
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[LITES2.EXE]LITES2ROUTINES.EXE.    See    the    LITES2
           Reference Manual for details of user routines

        o  LSL$LITES2WORK points to a directory in which  LITES2  is  to  put  IFF
           workspace and dump files, usually LSL$LOCAL_ROOT:[LITES2.WORK].

        o  LSL$LITES2CMD points to a directory in which  LITES2  expects  to  find
           command   files   (default  extension  .LCM).   This  will  usually  be
           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LITES2.CMD].  In particular this directory will normally
           contain  the  system-wide  and terminal dependent LITES2 initialisation
           files.

           On later systems, LSL$LITES2CMD  is  a  search  list,  running  through
           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LITES2.CMD],  then through all [.CMD] directories on the
           public tree.

        o  LSL$LITES2JNL points to a directory into which LITES2 writes a  journal
           file  of  commands  given during a session (extension .LJN).  This will
           usually be LSL$LOCAL_ROOT:[LITES2.JNL].   It  is  advisable  either  to
           regularly  purge this directory, or to set a version limit on it (using
           the DCL command SET DIRECTORY/VERSION_LIMIT='number'), so that  journal
           files do not build up without limit.

        o  LSL$LITES2SETUP points to a directory in which LITES2  preserves  table
           setup  parameters for use in future sessions (file extension .SET).  It
           is often convenient to use the  same  directory  as  LSL$LITES2JNL  for
           this.

        o  LSL$LITES2TERMINAL if set to a string, means that this string  is  used
           as   the   terminal  name  when  naming  device  dependent  files.   If
           LSL$LITES2TERMINAL is not assigned  then  the  logical  translation  of
           SYS$COMMAND is used as the terminal name.

        o  LSL$LITES2INI may be set to point to a file of  LITES2  commands  which
           will be obeyed automatically every time LITES2 is started up.

        o  If a serial interface Laser-Scan Vector Graphics Display is to be  used
           for graphics output, eg a Sigmex 6164, then LSL$TK points to the serial
           line to be used for communication with it eg TXB6:.

        o  If a parallel interface Laser-Scan Raster Graphics  Display  is  to  be
           used  for  graphics  output, eg Sigmex ARGS 7000, then LSL$VS points to
           the parallel interface port to be used for  communication  with  it  eg
           IDA0:.

        o  LSL$SIGMA_COLOUR, LSL$TEK_COLOUR, LSL$VAX_COLOUR LSL$DECW_COLOUR  point
           to  the  colour  table definition file for the appropriate display type
           (Sigmex 6000, Tek 4100, or VWS VAXstation, or DECwindows VAXstation).

  The vector scanning and line following digitiser  package  (VTRAK)  has  a  very
  complex  and  largely  self-contained  environment,  which  is  described in the
  package documentation for the VTRAK package.   It  requires  a  the  SCANCONVERT
  package and a source of raster scanned map data.

  Laseraid  is  the  Laser-Scan  vector  scanning  and  line-following   automatic
  digitiser program.  It uses a FASTRAK or Lasertrak digitiser.  See also packages
  HRD and HIACC  for  details  of  the  device  support  required.   Its  required
  environment is described below.

        o  The environment of the kernel packages LSLSYSTEM and MAPPING is assumed
           to be present, particularly LSL$IF.

        o  TT points to the terminal for interactive input and output.  Note  that
           this is used rather than SYS$INPUT and SYS$OUTPUT.

        o  LSL$LK points to the disk  and  directory  containing  the  patch  file
           (Laseraid parameter file) to be used to initialise the parameter values
           which control the line following and other digitising algorithms.  This
           will normally be LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LASERAID.PATCH].

        o  As package LASERAID requires a Lasertrak (or  FASTRAK)  digitiser,  the
           environment   of   the   HRD   package  is  therefore  required.   Note
           particularly that SYS$HRD  points  to  the  Lasertrak,  and  SYS$LDSY21
           points   to   the   system   constants  file  for  digitising,  usually
           LDSY21.R'nn' , where 'nn' is the Lasertrak number.

        o  LSL$GU points to the disk and directory  containing  the  guidance  IFF
           file that will be used to guide the digitising operation.  This file is
           only used if the guidance mode  of  operation  is  selected.   It  will
           usually be the same place as LSL$IF.

        o  LSL$FLFHLP points to the help file  containing  the  explanatory  texts

  The DIGSYS  on-line  digitising  system  has  a  complex  environment  which  is
  documented  more  fully  in  the "DIGSYS Reference Manual".  Note that DIGSYS is
  usually invoked  via  a  captive  CONTROL  user.   A  summary  of  the  required
  environment is given below.

        o  LSL$DIG'n' where n=1,2,..., should point to the  device  names  of  the
           terminal  ports to which the digitising tables are attached.  Note that
           earlier versions of DIGSYS used the logical names SYS$DIG'n' instead.

        o  MCE$MODE should translate, system-wide, to the security status  of  the
           computer system - either OPEN or SECURE.

        o  MCE$SECTERM should point to a secure (/HARDCOPY) terminal  for  use  by
           the  CONTROL  process  during  SECURE  operation.  It may be omitted if
           SECURE operation is never required.

        o  LSL$EXE search list should point through the disk and  directory  where
           the digitising system's CONTROL and TABLE executable images used by the
           system are held.  This is usually LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[DIGSYS.EXE].

        o  LSL$MGMT should point to the disk and directory  where  the  digitising
           management     files     are    held.     This    will    usually    be
           LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.MGMT]

        o  LSL$CPF should point to the disk and directory where the control  point
           files  are  held.  It may be omitted if the control point file facility
           is not used.  It is  usual  for  this  directory  to  be  the  same  as
           LSL$MGMT.

        o  LSL$MENU should point to the disk and directory where the menu and puck
           definition  files  are  held.  It is usual for this directory to be the
           same as LSL$MGMT.

        o  LSL$'task name' is the general form of a series of logical  names  that
           are  set  up at group level in the CONTROL user's login file, and which
           define default disk and directory names for the IFF files  relating  to
           particular tasks.

        o  LSL$DIGMBTERM is a logical name created by the digitising system itself
           and translating, group-wide, to the mailbox used by the CONTROL process
           for receiving notification  of  the  termination  of  digitising  TABLE
           processes.  Note that earlier versions of DIGSYS used the logical names
           DIGMBTERM instead.

        o  LSL$DIG_OPTIONS should point to the options file which defines how  the
           DIGSYS system will behave.

        o  LSL_DIGCEFC'table' are the names of  the  common  event  flag  clusters
           created  by  DIGSYS,  where  'table' identifies the TABLE process which
           will use the cluster to communicate with the CONTROL process.

        o  LSL_CONGBLSEC is the name of the  control  global  section  created  by
           DIGSYS.

        o  LSL_MENGBL'table' are the names of the multiple  menu  global  sections
           created  by  DIGSYS,  where  'table' identifies the TABLE process whose
           puck and menu definitions are contained within the section.

  The IFF data conversion package (CONVERT) is an optional component which  allows
  conversion  of IFF data to and from a variety of standard external formats.  The
  package is divided into modules, and each customer will  normally  receive  only
  those  modules  which  are  relevant.  The required environment may vary between
  options, but is basically the same as for the IMP package.

  limited  environment  similar  to  that  of  IMP  (qv).   Any  customer-specific
  Laser-Scan logical names should  take  the  form  LSL$'customer'_'purpose'.   eg
  LSL$OS_CODES for customer OS (Ordnance Survey), code lookup file.

  The Structured IFF data package  (STRUCTURE)  is  an  optional  component  which
  allows the creation and manipulation of link-node structured (junction) IFF data
  files.  The ILINK program which is a major  element  of  this  package  will  do
  extensive  geometric  "tidies"  on vector data, eg extension, truncation, common
  alignment, etc.  The required environment is described below.

        o  The environment of the kernel packages LSLSYSTEM and MAPPING is assumed

           LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.IFF].  The same directory will  receive  the  output
           structured IFF data file (IFJ file).

        o  LSL$LITES2CMD points to the disk and directory that  will  receive  the

        o  The X-windows GIS package (XGIS) is needed as  the  basis  of  the  GIS
           application packages METROPOLIS (for land information) and HORIZON (for
           environmental information).  It requires DECwindows and OSF/MOTIF.   It
           provides  a  user-friendly  menu  interaction  environment,  using  the
           UILMENUS facilities of the LITES2 package.

           It has a complex environment, described in the  documentation  for  the
           XGIS  package.  It is structured into 3 layers of software:  XGIS core,
           product (eg HORIZON), and customer-specific.

        o  The land information  GIS  (METROPOLIS)  is  a  Geographic  Information
           System  aimed at the storage, retrieval, and analysis of information on
           human land usage.  Its environment is determined by  the  XGIS  support
           package.

        o  The Environmental GIS (HORIZON)  is  a  Geographic  Information  System
           aimed  at  the  storage,  retrieval, and analysis of information on the
           environment.   Its  environment  is  determined  by  the  XGIS  support
           package.

  This package includes device driver and interface library  for  the  HRD-1  high
  resolution  display/plotter,  and also for the Lasertrak and FASTRAK digitisers.
  Note that this package is also used outside the LAMPS environment to support use
  of HRD-1 displays for other applications, and that it may need the HIACC package
  if high accuracy plotting is to be achieved.

  Its required environment is described below.  See the "VAX LDLIB and  HR: Driver
  Technical  Documentation  and  System  Manager's  Guide"  for  a  more  detailed
  description.

        o  SYS$HRD points to the HRD/Lasertrak/FASTRAK to be used, eg HRA0:.

        o  SYS$LDSY21  points  to  the  system  constants  file   containing   the
           machine-specific   calibrations  to  be  used.   An  example  would  be
           LSL$LDSYDIR:LDSY21.B22 for blue refresh on machine 122.

        o  LSL$LDSYDIR points to the disk  and  directory  containing  all  system
           constants files.  This is usually LSL$SITE_ROOT:[HRD.LOOKUP].

        o  HRD$EXE points to the disk  and  directory  containing  the  engineer's
           diagnostics,  exerciser,  and  calibration  utilities.  This is usually
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[HRD.LIB].

        o  LSL$HRDSYSDRV points to the disk and directory  containing  the  device
           driver.   Provided  that LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT is resident on the system disk
           (SYS$SYSDEVICE:), then this can  be  LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[HRD.DRIVER].   If
           the  public  tree  is  on  some  other  disk, then a copy of the driver
           (HRDRIVER.EXE, or HRQDRIVER.EXE) must be placed on the system disk in a
           directory   pointed  at  by  LSL$HRDSYSDRV.   This  is  because  it  is
           referenced at bootstrap (system startup) time from SYCONFIG.COM  before
           the other disks have been mounted in SYSTARTUP.COM.

        o  LSL$LIBRARY is usually a search list  pointing  through  the  disk  and
           directory  containing  the  LDLIB  interface  library.  This is usually
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[HRD.LIB]

        o  LSL$CMNLDL points to the disk and directory containing  FORTRAN  common
           block  declarations  for  interfacing  to LDLIB.  This will normally be
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[HRD.COMMON.LDLIB].

        o  LSL$COM is  usually  a  search  list  pointing  through  the  disk  and
           directory  containing  calibration command procedures.  This is usually
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[HRD.COM]

  This package includes device support utilities for use of  an  Altek  digitising
  table,  and  an  interface  library for use of a manual digitising table via the
  Laser-Scan Table Monitor.  The Table Monitor is a detached process which runs at
  elevated  priority  and  receives  digitising  events  from  the table.  It then
  communicates these events to an applications process (such as LITES2  or  TVES),
  using  common  event  flags  (CEFs) and a shared global section.  See the "Table
  Monitor Reference Manual" for details.

  Tables supplied by Laser-Scan are currently likely to be Altek tables with  AC40
  controllers.   Other  manufacturer's  tables may be acceptable to some programs,
  possibly  with  reduced   functionality.    Contact   Laser-Scan   for   further
  information.  The TABLE package required environment is described below.

        o  LSL$MONITOR_TABLE points to the serial line for the table  to  be  used
           for  digitising  if there is more than one table on the system, or if a
           named Table Monitor process is to be used.

        o  LSL$EXE points through the directory containing the Table Monitor image
           (TABMON)  to  allow the detached process starter image (STARTMON) to be
           used.  STARTMON must either be installed with ALTPRI privilege,  or  be
           invoked by a privileged process (eg system startup).

        o  LSL$LIBRARY is usually a search list  pointing  through  the  directory
           containing  TABLIB.OLB,  the  interface library.  This will normally be
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[TABLE.LIB]

        o  LSL$CMNTAB points to the disk and directory containing  FORTRAN  common
           block  declarations  for  interfacing to TABLIB.  This will normally be
           LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[TABLE.COMMON.TABLIB].

        o  LSL$MGMT points to the disk and directory to contain the shared  global
           section  files,  and  the  error files, used to communicate between the
           Table Monitor and the applications program (eg LITES2).

        o  LSL$TABMON_ROUTINE_'ddcu'  if  defined,  points  to  a   shared   image
           containing a decode routine to handle the format of a table event for a
           non-standard table which is on serial port 'ddcu':, eg TXA6:.
