  1  [3mIntroduction[0m

  This note defines the method and limits of coordinate storage in IFF data files,
  as implemented by Laser-Scan LAMPS mapping software, and to show that no loss of
  coordinate precision is likely to result in ordinary use.



  2  [3mStorage[0m

  LSL IFF files are word-addressed direct-access binary  files,  with  a  variable
  length record mechanism (Entries) superimposed.  Coordinates within IFF are held
  in  ST,  ZS  or  CB  entries,  depending  on  whether  they  are  2D,   3D,   or
  multi-dimensional  points.   Regardless  of  entry type, coordinates are held as
  32-bit (single precision) floating point binary  numbers.   This  gives  them  a
  range of 10**38 to 10**-38, and between 7 and 8 significant figures.

  All coordinates in a file are assumed by the software to be relative to a  local
  origin, the value of which is held in a Map Descriptor at the start of the file,
  as a pair of 64-bit (double-precision)  floating  point  binary  numbers.   This
  gives  a  range of 10**38 to 10**-38, and between 15 and 16 significant figures.
  It is not necessary that this local origin should be one of the corners  or  the
  middle  of  the  area,  merely  that it should lie reasonably close to the area.
  Conventionally, it is often set so that the bottom left corner of the sheet lies
  at  (0,0), but it is quite acceptable for several files to share the same origin
  offset, eg of the current UTM zone "brick".



  3  [3mUnits[0m

  One of the main advantages of coordinate storage as floating point  rather  than
  integer  numbers,  is that IFF files are largely independent of the units of the
  data stored in them.  Map data is often stored with ground metres as  the  unit,
  but  IFF data can and does handle units as distinct as lat/long degrees, seconds
  of arc, feet, miles, nautical miles, sheet mm, sheet thou, or if you want to  be
  ambitious, microns or parsecs!

  The important thing to remember is that the choice of unit does not  affect  the
  precision of the data, because fractional values can be stored as easily as tens
  or millions.



  4  [3mPrecision[0m

  A DEC 32-bit (single precision) floating point binary number has 1 sign  bit,  8
  exponent  bits,  and a 23 bit mantissa.  Because the value is always normalised,
  the first mantissa bit which would always be a 1 is assumed, giving an effective
  mantissa  of  24 bits.  This gives a precision of approximately 1 part in 2**23,


                                                                            Page 2


  allowing 33,554,433 positive values, doubled to 67,108,865  if  negative  values
  are used.

  The 64-bit double precision origin offset has the same structure, but has  a  55
  bit mantissa, allowing more than 1,000,000,000,000,000 distinct values.

  The combination of the single precision coordinate  with  the  double  precision
  offset  allows  us  to store coordinates in a uniform space, which can typically
  cover the whole earth to a ground precision of much better than 1mm  in  typical
  sized IFF files.

  The precision if you [3mreally[0m want to store the whole world in  one  IFF  file  is
  still  better  than a ground metre.  In large scale work where more precision is
  needed, the effective scale and  consequent  data  volumes  always  necessitates
  spatial partitioning of the data, so that precision is automatically maintained.

  Where multiple IFF files are handled together, as  in  IMERGE,  or  LITES2,  the
  coordinate storage is not affected, but the [3mdifference[0m in origin offsets is used
  to relate coordinates in the various files.   The  same  rules  about  area  and
  precision therefore apply.



  5  [3mAccuracy[0m

  Accuracy is a controversial subject when applied to map  data.   It  is  a  term
  which  probably  best describes the "level of confidence" in a coordinate value.
  For typical coordinate data which has been hand digitised from printed maps,  it
  is  affected  by  such  factors  as  the  original surveyor's care, the geodetic
  calculations involving trig points, the map drawing, the printing  process,  the
  paper  stretch,  the  digitising  operator's  care,  the table setup method, the
  digitising table hardware, and the software transformation to ground units.

  What is fairly certain however is that it is not affected thereafter by  storage
  in  IFF  files!  Because the IFF coordinates are stored in "Real World" units eg
  ground metres, and the same storage system is at the heart of  all  LSL  mapping
  software,  coordinates  do  not  have to be transformed further in the course of
  normal operation, and hence do not suffer from rounding errors.
