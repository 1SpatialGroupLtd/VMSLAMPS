  1  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan DFAD package contains a number of modules that have been designed
  to  specifically  handle  Digital  LandMass  Simulation  (DLMS)  Digital Feature
  Analysis Data.  Utilities are provided to create, examine and validate DFAD data
  held  within  a  Laser-Scan  Internal  Feature  Format  (IFF)  file,  along with
  utilities to read and write a DLMS  DFAD  format  magnetic  tape.   In  addition
  modules  are provided to create and modify a Feature Analysis Data Table (FADT);
  to merge a FADT with DFAD coordinate information, and to access an on-line  DLMS
  Rules File.

  DFAD runs under  VAX-VMS  Version  5.4-3  or  later  version,  assuming  upwards
  compatibility  by  DEC.   DFAD  coexists concurrently with other interactive and
  batch processes.

  Laser-Scan's [1mI[0mFF [1mM[0map [1mP[0mrocessing package (IMP) is a  prerequisite.   Laser-Scan's
  LITES2 interactive digitising and editing software is recommended for digitising
  and editing vector input data.  VTRAK automated digitising  is  recommended  for
  large numbers of input documents.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDFAD2I[0m

  The module DFAD2I transfers a manuscript from a Digital LandMass  System  (DLMS)
  Digital  Feature  Analysis  Data  (DFAD)  format  magnetic  tape to a Laser-Scan
  Internal Feature Format (IFF) disk file.

  The user may specify which manuscript to transfers by means of qualifiers on the
  program  command  line.   Selection  may be performed on the basis of manuscript
  number, or manuscript latitude and longitude origin.  The tape device from which
  the data is read is similarly specified by the user on the command line.

  Options are provided in the program to produce a dump of the tape, and to enable
  the  output  of  diagnostic messages describing the progress of the DFAD tape to
  IFF file conversion.


  DFAD Software Product Specification


  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDFADVAL[0m

  The module DFADVAL is used to validate an IFF file  containing  DFAD  data.   It
  performs  validation  on  feature geometry, DFAD accuracy region attributes, and
  DFAD point, line and area attribute records.  The module also  validates  header
  fields in the MCE Map Header of the IFF file.

  Attribute validation is performed  against  the  DLMS  DFAD  specification,  and
  optionally againsts rules contained in a DLMS Rule file.

  The module is generally run before  DFAD  data  is  written  to  a  DFAD  format
  magnetic tape.

  DFADVAL produces a validation report, which may be output  at  the  terminal  or
  sent  to  a  user  specified  list file for subsequent printing and examination.
  Optionally a LITES2 guidance file may be produced to aid the correction  of  any
  features that fail validation.

  Geometry validation operations,  include  checks  on  the  coordinates  of  DFAD
  features  to  ensure  that  they are within the manuscript bounds; checks on the
  number of coordinates defining a point, line or area  feature,  and  checks  for
  crossing  or  touching  line  segments.   Areas are validated to ensure that the
  coordinates are defined in the correct direction, and that area  features  close
  correctly.

  Attribute validation operations ensure that all analysis fields are present  for
  each  point,  line  and  area feature; that each analysis code complies with the
  DLMS specification, and that  analysis  codes  in  combination  are  valid  when
  compared against a set of DLMS rules.

  Map Header checks involve ensuring that values for all fields required  for  the
  DFAD  DSI  and  ACC  records  are present and conform to the DLMS Specification.
  Accuracy  regions  checks  involve  examining  both  the  coordinates  and   the
  attributes of the features.

  Which checks are performed on the data,  may  be  selected  by  the  user  using
  program command line qualifiers.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mFADTINPUT[0m

  The module FADTINPUT enables a user to create, edit  and  list  a  DLMS  Feature
  Analysis Data Table (FADT) file.  The module validates the FADT records on entry
  against the DLMS Specification, and optionally against a set of validation rules
  in a DLMS Rule file.

  The operation of the module is controlled by a series of forms (DEC FMS) or by a
  series of logical names set up prior to invoking the module.

  Forms are provided to allow the input and validation of DFAD DSI and ACC  record
  data,  and  DFAD  feature  analysis  data.  The use of forms offers considerable
  flexibility, while enabling stingent checks to be made on the format of the data
  that are entered.

  In the Laser-Scan DLMS DFAD production system, the information entered into  the
  FADT  via  the  forms,  will be merged with coordinate data held in an IFF file.
  This merging is performed using the module FADTMERGE.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mFADTMERGE[0m

  The module FADTMERGE merges records in  a  Feature  Analysis  Data  File  (FADT)
  created  by the module FADTINPUT, with DFAD feature coordinate data contained in
  an IFF file.

  DFAD feature data is merged on the basis of feature analysis code (FAC) for  the
  FADT file, and feature serial number (FSN) for the IFF file.  DSI and ACC header
  data contained in the FADT file is transferred to a Map Header in the IFF file.

  The user may specify which type of records are merged  (for  example  just  data
  relating  to  the  header records) by means of qualifiers on the program command
  line.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mI2DFAD[0m

  The module I2DFAD transfers data from a Laser-Scan Internal Feature Format (IFF)
  disk  file  to  a  Digital  LandMass System (DLMS) Digital Feature Analysis Data
  (DFAD) format magnetic tape.

  The user may select whether to append data to any existing  manuscripts  on  the
  tape,  or  to  write  the  data as the first manuscript on the tape, by means of
  qualifiers on the program command line.  The tape device to which the data is to
  be written is similarly specified by the user on the command line.

  An option is provided in the program to output  diagnostic  messages  describing
  the progress of the IFF to DFAD tape conversion.


  DFAD Software Product Specification


  [1mMODULE[0m [1mMCEHED[0m

  The module MCEHED allows fields in a Map  Header  (MH)  entry  in  a  Laser-Scan
  Internal  Feature  Format  (IFF)  file to be examined or edited.  The Map Header
  must be a MCE (customer type 1) header.

  The main use for the  module  in  DLMS  work  is  to  enter  and  modify  header
  information  that  is  held in the DSI and ACC records of a DFAD format magnetic
  tape.

  The module is command driven.  Commands are provided to examine  all  fields  in
  the  header, or a group of fields (eg.  fields relating to manuscript coverage).
  All fields in the header may be edited using the module.
