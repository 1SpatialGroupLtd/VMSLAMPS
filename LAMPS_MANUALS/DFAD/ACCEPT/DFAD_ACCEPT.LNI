  1  [1mINTRODUCTION[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan Package
  DFAD.

  DFAD is a package containing  a  number  of  modules  that  have  been  designed
  specifically  to  handle  DLMS  Digital  Feature  Analysis  Data.  Utilities are
  provided to create, examine and validate DFAD data  held  within  a  Laser  Scan
  Internal  Feature  Format  (IFF)  file, along with utilities to read and write a
  DLMS DFAD format magnetic tape.  In addition modules are provided to create  and
  modify  a  Feature  Analysis  Data  Table  (FADT);  to  merge  a  FADT with DFAD
  coordinate information, and to access an on-line DLMS Rules File.

  The DFAD package includes the modules  DFAD2I,  DFADVAL,  FADTINPUT,  FADTMERGE,
  I2DFAD and MCEHED.

  Data input to the DFAD package is from IFF  file,  FADT  file  and  DFAD  format
  magnetic  tape.  In addition the package modules FADTINPUT and DFADVAL utilise a
  DLMS Rules File.  Output from the package modules is to IFF file, FADT file  and
  DFAD format magnetic tape.



  2  [1mOVERVIEW[0m

  For the purpose of acceptance, an IFF file containing  DFAD  feature  coordinate
  data but no DFAD attribute information is provided.  This acceptance file has an
  unset MCE Map Header, and  a  layer  0  containing  no  DFAD  accuracy  regions.
  Feature  attribute  data will be merged with the coordinate data, and map header
  and accuracy region data will be entered, as part of the  acceptance  procedure.
  Opportunities  are  provided in the acceptance test to examine the premerged and
  merged IFF files using the IMP module IPATCH.

  In addition to this IFF file, a second file containing merged and validated DFAD
  data  is  provided.  This file is used with the other IFF file for acceptance of
  the module I2DFAD.

  A partially completed FADT file is provided.  The  header  and  accuracy  region
  records  have  already  been  entered,  along  with  all but 3 feature attribute
  records.  The remaining attribute records will be entered  interactively  during
  package acceptance.

  A DLMS Rules File is provided.  This will be used to validate DFAD analysis data
  as part of the acceptance of the modules FADTINPUT and DFADVAL.

  In order to carry out acceptance for the  tape  conversion  modules  I2DFAD  and
  DFAD2I,  a  scratch  magnetic  tape  is required, and should be loaded on a tape
  drive.  The acceptance procedure will inquire the name of the tape drive.

  Acceptance will be performed using a supplied DCL command  procedure  to  invoke
  the  DFAD  modules,  and  issue  module commands.  For acceptance of the modules
  FADTINPUT and MCEHED, and in order to examine  the  acceptance  IFF  file  using
  IPATCH,  it is necessary for commands to be typed at the terminal.  The commands
  that should be entered are detailed in this document.

  The acceptance procedure is invoked by typing [1m@LSL$COM:DFAD_ACCEPT[0m



  3  [1mDESCRIPTION OF ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE[0m

  The acceptance procedure first demonstrates the module FADTINPUT.  FADTINPUT  is
  used to create, edit and list a FADT file.  This file contains manuscript header
  records, accuracy region records, and feature attribute (analysis) records.  The
  data from the FADT is transferred to an IFF file, and attached to DFAD features,
  using the module FADTMERGE.

  A partially completed FADT will be used for acceptance.  The header and accuracy
  records  have  been  entered,  and  will  be  examined  and  listed  as  part of
  acceptance.  All but 3 feature attribute records have also been entered.   These
  records will be entered interactively during acceptance of the module.

  FADTINPUT will be invoked by the command procedure, and a  new  version  of  the
  DFAD package acceptance FADT will be created.

  The first form to be displayed on the  screen  is  the  'FADTINPUT  Record  Type
  Option'.   To examine the completed header record, enter [1m4<CR>[0m.  The contents of
  the FADT header page will be displayed on the screen.  Use [1m<CR>[0m to return to the
  'Record  Type  Option'  form.   To  view  the completed DSI Record, enter [1m2<CR>[0m.
  Following the display of the DSI data  use  [1m<CR>[0m  to  return  the  'Record  Type
  Option' form.

  To view the accuracy records, enter [1m1<CR>[0m.  The form that  appears  first  shows
  the contents of the ACC header record.  Note that 2 accuracy regions are defined
  for this manuscript.  To view  the  attributes  and  coordinates  of  the  first
  accuracy  region  type  [1m<CR>[0m.  Use [1m<CR>[0m again to view the second accuracy region
  data, and then [1m<CR>[0m to return to the 'Record Type Option' form.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The next part of acceptance for FADTINPUT involves the input  of  analysis  data
  for  3  DFAD  features.   Select  the  option  to  input FADT feature records by
  pressing [1m<CR>[0m.  An empty FADT record will be displayed on the  screen,  and  the
  cursor will be positioned on the FAC field.

  Analysis data for DFAD feature 6008 will be entered first.   To  do  this,  type
  [1m6008[0m  and  press  [1m<TAB>[0m (on the lefthand part of the keyboard).  Note that since
  this record does not already exist in the file, the  remaining  analysis  fields
  (with  the  exception  of  the  defaulted 'security' and 'releasability' fields)
  remain blank.

  The cursor will now be positioned in the 'type' field.  A DFAD feature may be of
  type  0  (point),  type  1  (line)  or  type  2 (area).  To check that FADTINPUT
  correctly validates any entered values against the  DLMS  format  specification,
  enter  an  invalid  number eg.  [1m4[0m followed by [1m<TAB>[0m.  The message [1m'Type[0m [1mdoes[0m [1mnot[0m
  [1mobey[0m [1mDLMS[0m [1mSpecification'[0m will be displayed.  Use the delete key to  cancel  this
  value,  and  enter  a  correct value for a point feature by typing [1m0[0m followed by
  [1m<TAB>[0m.

  The cursor will now be positioned in the 'FID' field.  The correct FID for  this
  DFAD  point  feature  is 902.  Enter this by typing [1m902[0m and press the [1m<TAB>[0m key.
  The cursor will now be positioned in the 'height' field.  Enter a value of 20 by


  DFAD Acceptance tests                                                     Page 4


  typing  [1m20[0m  followed  by [1m<TAB>[0m.  The 'security' has already been given a default
  value of 0.  To accept this value press the [1m<TAB>[0m key.  This operation should be
  repeated for the 'releasability' field.

  The cursor will now be positioned in the 'SMC'  field.   To  enter  the  correct
  value  of 3 type [1m3[0m followed by [1m<TAB>[0m.  Use the same operation to enter values of
  10, 20 and 50 for the 'ori', 'width' and  'length'  fields  respectively.   Note
  that  when  [1m<TAB>[0m  key is pressed after entering the 'length' field, the message
  [1m'No[0m [1mnext[0m [1mfield[0m [1mon[0m [1mform'[0m is displayed to indicate that there are no  more  fields
  on this form.

  To move the cursor to a previous field use the [1m<BS>[0m (backspace) key.  Using this
  key  and  the [1m<TAB>[0m key it is possible to move between fields on the form.  This
  mechanism allows fields that have been incorrectly entered to be modified.

  To enter the analysis record for this feature  into  the  FADT  use  [1m<CR>[0m.   The
  message  [1mValidating[0m  [1mthe[0m [1mentire[0m [1mrecord[0m will be displayed briefly indicating that
  FADTINPUT is checking the analysis records against  the  DFAD  acceptance  Rules
  File.   This  operation  involves  the  validation  of  all the analysis data in
  combination.  Any validation failures are  reported,  and  the  cursor  will  be
  automatically  positioned  over  a  field  in error, allowing the user to edit a
  field value.  If validation is successful, the record will  be  written  to  the
  FADT, and a blank feature record form will be displayed.

  Use the operations detailed above to enter analysis data for DFAD point features
  6009 and 6010.  The required field values for these features are:

            [1mFAC[0m [1m6009[0m [1mtype[0m [1m0[0m [1mFID[0m [1m420[0m [1mheight[0m [1m8[0m [1msecurity[0m [1m0[0m [1mreleasability[0m [1m0[0m [1mSMC[0m [1m3[0m
                     [1mori[0m [1m14[0m [1mwidth[0m [1m4[0m [1mlength[0m [1m20[0m
            [1mFAC[0m [1m6010[0m [1mtype[0m [1m0[0m [1mFID[0m [1m420[0m [1mheight[0m [1m8[0m [1msecurity[0m [1m0[0m [1mreleasability[0m [1m0[0m [1mSMC[0m [1m3[0m
                     [1mori[0m [1m63[0m [1mwidth[0m [1m20[0m [1mlength[0m [1m20[0m

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  When these records have been successfully entered into the FADT, it is  possible
  to  examine  them,  and  modify  them  if  required.   The  cursor should now be
  positioned in a 'FAC' field of a blank record form.  In  order  to  examine  the
  analysis  data  associated with DFAD feature 6008, enter [1m6008[0m followed by [1m<TAB>[0m.
  The contents of this record will now be displayed on the form.  Movement between
  the  form  fields  is  now possible using the [1m<TAB>[0m and [1m<BS>[0m keys.  To exit from
  this record use [1m<CR>[0m.  Note that the  entire  record  will  again  be  validated
  before writing back to the FADT.

  To return to the 'Record Options Form' use [1m<CR>[0m, and select option 5 on the form
  by  typing [1m5<CR>[0m in order to exit from FADTINPUT.  The contents of the FADT will
  now be saved, and used in the remaining stages of the acceptance procedure.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  It is possible to list the contents of a FADT file using FADTINPUT.  Answer  yes
  to  the  question 'List the contents of the FADT file on the line-printer ?', in
  order to produce a listing of the DFAD acceptance FADT.  This should be  checked
  to  verify  that  the  analysis codes for features 6008, 6009 and 6010 have been
  correctly entered.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The module FADTMERGE is used to transfer FADT  records  to  an  IFF  file.   The
  header,  DSI and accuracy header data is transferred to the relevant fields in a
  MCE Map Header.  The accuracy region data from the FADT is used to form a series
  of  accuracy  regions  in  layer  0 of the IFF file.  The feature records in the
  FADT, which contain the feature analysis data are merged with the  DFAD  feature
  coordinates  (geometry)  in  the IFF file.  Merging is performed on the basis of
  FAC value in the FADT, and Feature Serial Number (FSN) in the IFF file.

  Prior to merging an opportunity is offered to  examine  the  unmerged  IFF  file
  using  IPATCH.   This  is  the  IFF  file that is input into FADTMERGE.  If this
  option is selected, the following sequence of commands should be  typed  at  the
  terminal, once the IPATCH> prompt is displayed.

  Type [1mMH<CR>[0m to position on the Map Header, and then enter [1mTYPE<CR>[0m to  list  the
  contents  of the entry on the terminal.  Note that with the exception of the Map
  Header type, and Map Header length fields at the beginning of  the  record,  all
  the remaining fields are unset.

  Type [1mNO<CR>[0m to position on the start of the first layer in the file.  This  will
  be  layer  0.  If you now move to the next entry in the file by typing [1mNEXT<CR>[0m,
  you will find you are now positioned on the end of the layer (EO  entry).   This
  is because the layer is empty and currently contains no DFAD accuracy regions.

  Type [1mNO<CR>[0m to position on the start of the next layer.  This is layer  1  which
  holds DFAD area features.  Type [1mNEXT<CR>[0m and you will be positioned on the start
  of the first feature.  Repeat this command 3 times and you will be positioned in
  turn  on  the  FS, ST and EF entries for this feature.  Note that there is no AC
  entry - this will be generated by FADTMERGE and will hold the  feature  analysis
  data.  Note also that the feature code is 102 which is used globally to identify
  a DFAD point feature.  A feature code that is  specific  to  the  type  of  area
  feature will be generated by FADTMERGE.

  The [1mNEXT<CR>[0m may be repeated a number of times to  examine  a  number  of  other
  features in the file.  Type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m to exit from IPATCH.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  FADTMERGE is now invoked  to  transfer  FADT  records  to  the  IFF  file.   The
  /ACCURACY /HEADER and /MERGE qualifiers are used to transfer all FADT records to
  the IFF file.  The /FC qualifier is used so that features in the output IFF file
  will  be  given  a feature code that is related to both the type of feature, and
  the feature identifier.  The input FADT is the FADT  modified  during  FADTINPUT
  acceptance.   Note  that  if the 3 records originally missing from the file have
  not been entered, a mismatch for FSNs 6008, 6009 and 6010 will  be  reported  by
  FADTMERGE, and these features will not be copied to the output file.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  An opportunity is now offered to examine the merged IFF file using IPATCH.  This
  is  the file generated by the module FADTMERGE.  If this option is selected, the
  following sequence of commands should be typed at the terminal,  once  the  file
  IPATCH> prompt is displayed.

  Type [1mMH<CR>[0m to position on the Map Header, and then enter [1mTYPE<CR>[0m to  list  the
  contents  of  the  entry on the terminal.  Note that a large number of fields in
  the Map Header are now set.  The field values may be examined more  meaningfully
  during package acceptance for the DFAD module MCEHED.


  DFAD Acceptance tests                                                     Page 6


  Type [1mNO<CR>[0m to position on the start of the first layer in the file.  This  will
  be  layer  0.  If you now move to the next entry in the file by typing [1mNEXT<CR>[0m,
  you will find you are positioned on the start of the first accuracy region.

  If the [1mNEXT<CR>[0m command is given you will be positioned on the FS.  The  feature
  code  for a DFAD accuracy region is 301.  If [1mNEXT<CR>[0m is typed again you will be
  positioned on an AC entry.  The type is 8 indicating an ACC  accuracy  ancillary
  code, and the text field will hold the absolute and relative horizontal accuracy
  values.  If a listing of the FADT was produced as part of FADTINPUT  acceptance,
  these  values should be compared with the FADT record values for accuracy region
  1.  If [1mNEXT<CR>[0m is typed again you will be positioned on the feature's ST entry.
  If  you enter [1mTYPE<CR>[0m the coordinates of the accuracy region will be displayed.
  The  coordinates  have  been  translated  from  their  latitude  and   longitude
  DDDMMSS.SH  representation  in the FADT, to latitude and longitude in .1 seconds
  of arc relative to the origin of the manuscript.  If [1mNEXT<CR>[0m is now  given  you
  will be positioned on the end of the first accuracy region.

  Using [1mNEXT<CR>[0m repeatedly as detailed  above  will  allow  the  second  accuracy
  region  to  be  similarly examined.  Repeat the command until the end of layer 0
  (an EO entry) is encountered.

  Type [1mNO<CR>[0m to positioned on the next layer  in  the  IFF  file,  and  then  use
  [1mNEXT<CR>[0m  repeatedly  to  examine  a  number of the DFAD features present in the
  layer.  When positioned on a FS entry note that a feature now has a feature code
  that  is  a combination of the feature type and feature identifier.  The formula
  used to generate the feature code is:

  [1mFC[0m [1m=[0m [1mFID[0m [1m+[0m [1m((type+1)[0m [1m*[0m [1m1000)[0m

  Note that all features now have an AC entry of type 7,  and  that  the  analysis
  data  has  been  transferred  from the FADT feature records to the text field of
  this AC.  Compare the listing of the FADT produced during  FADTINPUT  acceptance
  with  the AC records.  If data for DFAD features 6008, 6009 and 6010 was entered
  during FADTINPUT acceptance, these features may be specifically  examined.   For
  example  to  examine  feature  6008  type  [1mNF[0m  [1m6008<CR>[0m  followed by a series of
  [1mNEXT<CR>[0m commands.  Type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m to exit from IPATCH.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The DFAD module MCEHED is used to interactively examine and edit fields in a MCE
  IFF  Map  Header.  For acceptance, the file generated by FADTMERGE will be used.
  The majority of fields relevant to a DFAD manuscript, for example  the  coverage
  and  overall  accuracy  of  the  manuscript,  have  been  set  by FADTMERGE from
  information contained in the FADT.

  Once the prompt MCEHED> has been displayed, type [1mSHOW[0m [1mALL<CR>[0m to examine all the
  fields  in  the Map Header.  Specific groups of fields may be examined by giving
  the command SHOW followed by a group name.  Type [1mSHOW[0m  [1mCOVERAGE<CR>[0m  to  examine
  just  those  fields relating to the manuscript origin and corners.  If a listing
  of the FADT records has been produced  as  part  of  FADTINPUT  acceptance,  you
  should  compare  these  values  with the values in the FADT header record.  Type
  [1mSHOW[0m [1mACCURACY<CR>[0m to examine the overall accuracy of the manuscript, and compare
  with the manuscript accuracy values on the FADTINPUT listing.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  MCEHED may also be used to edit a Map Header field.  This is done by typing  the
  name  of  the  field,  and  supplying  a  new field value.  The new value may be
  specified on the same line as the field name, or in response to a prompt on  the
  terminal.   For  acceptance  the manuscript compilation date will be set.  First
  type [1mSHOW[0m [1mHISTORY<CR>[0m to examine the current compilation date  ([1mCDTE[0m).   In  the
  acceptance file this is still unset.  Type [1mCDTE[0m [1m31[0m [1m5[0m [1m88[0m [1m<CR>[0m and the compilation
  date will be set to 31-May-1988.  Type just [1mCDTE<CR>[0m and you  will  be  prompted
  for  a  date.   Note  that  the  data  format  DD-MMM-YY may also be used - type
  [1m30-Jun-88<CR>[0m and the compilation date will be set to 30-Jun-1988.   The  format
  of  the  date  stored  in  the  Map  Header  is  the format required in the DLMS

  The DFAD module DFADVAL is used  to  validate  the  MCE  Map  Header  data,  the
  geometry  and attributes of DFAD accuracy regions, and the geometry and analysis
  attributes of DFAD point, line and area  features.   In  a  production  flowline
  DFADVAL  should  be  run  on  a  DFAD IFF file before writing the data to a DFAD
  format magnetic tape.  Errors detected by DFADVAL should be corrected, depending
  on  the  nature of the error, using FADTINPUT, MCEHED or the LITES2 cartographic
  editor.

  Geometric checks such  as  whether  area  features  are  defined  anticlockwise;
  feature coordinates fall within the manuscript bounds, and whether features have
  any crossing segments are performed.  Checks on the FAC order of DFAD  features,
  and gaps in the FAC sequence are made, as well as checks on whether the analysis
  values held in the AC 7 entry of a DFAD feature are all present, and  are  valid
  for  the  type  of  feature.   If the /RULES qualifier is specified the analysis
  codes are also validated against entries in a DLMS Rules File.

  For acceptance, all categories of checks  will  be  performed  by  DFADVAL.   If
  acceptance succeeds only messages relating to the number of the first feature in
  each layer, breaks in sequence numbering, and the total number of features in  a
  layer should be reported on the terminal.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Acceptance for the  two  DFAD  tape  modules  I2DFAD  and  DFAD2I  is  performed
  together,  since  DFAD2I  is  used  to verify that the DFAD format tape has been
  correctly written by I2DFAD.  In order to carry out acceptance, a magnetic  tape
  should be loaded on a tape device.  This should be a scratch tape as I2DFAD will
  overwrite any existing data on the tape.  You will be asked to supply  the  tape
  device  name as part of acceptance.  Note that the tape should be loaded but not
  mounted.

  I2DFAD is used to transfer DFAD data held in  an  IFF  file  to  a  DFAD  format
  magnetic   tape.   The  format  of  this  tape  is  detailed  in  the  DMA  DLMS
  Specification.  I2DFAD will be run twice in order to transfer data  from  2  IFF
  files - the first of these files is the IFF file generated by FADTMERGE.  In the
  first run, the tape is initialised, so that the data is  written  as  the  first
  manuscript.   In the second run, the tape is rewound and the data is appended to
  the tape after the previous manuscript.  Note that as part  of  this  operation,
  DFAD2I  performs  checks  to  ensure  that  the  second  manuscript is correctly
  geographically positioned in relation to the first manuscript.  Diagnostics will
  be  enabled  so  that  the  progress  of  the  IFF  to DFAD data transfer may be

  An opportunity to confirm the structure of the DFAD tape using the DUMP utility,
  is  offered as part of acceptance.  If selected, a DUMP of the first 4 blocks of
  the tape will be output to the terminal.  Block 1 is a manuscript header  record
  of  27 bytes (6 36 bit words).  Block 2 is a DataSet Identification (DSI) of 648
  bytes length, and records in ASCII data extracted from the Map Header of the IFF
  file.   Block 3 is an Accuracy (ACC) record of 2700 bytes length, and records in
  ASCII accuracy region data extracted from layer 0 of the IFF file.  Block 4 is a
  feature  record of length 2709 bytes (602 36 bit words) holding in binary format
  the DFAD feature geometry and analysis data.

  DFAD2I is used to convert data from DFAD  format  magnetic  tape  to  IFF  file.
  DFAD2I  will  be run twice in order to transfer the two manuscripts on the tape.
  In the first run, the /MANUSCRIPT=1 qualifier is specified to select  the  first
  manuscript  on  the  tape.   In  the  second  run,  the tape is rewound, and the
  /LATITUDE and /LONGITUDE qualifiers are used to search for the second manuscript
  on  the basis of manuscript origin.  In both cases the /DIAGNOSTICS qualifier is
  specified so that the tape to disk conversion process may be monitored.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  To confirm that the data has been correctly read  from  tape,  the  IMP  utility
  IDIFFERENCE  may  be  used  to  compare  the  files generated by DFAD2I with the
  original files.   If  file  transfer  has  been  correctly  performed  the  only
  differences  should  be  in the IFF History (HI) entry, and NS entry, and in the
  Map Header (MH) entry since not all header fields are stored on the DFAD  format
  tape.  There should be no differences reported in the IFF feature coordinates or
  analysis codes.
