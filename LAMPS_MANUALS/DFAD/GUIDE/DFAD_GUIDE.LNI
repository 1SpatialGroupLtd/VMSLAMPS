            FSN 'integer' ('integer')
                                  FSN followed by two integer arguments indicates
                                  an IFF feature serial number. The integer number
                                  enclosed in round brackets is the feature
                                  internal sequence number.

            00003DE7              A hexadecimal address of a location within an
                                  IFF file. IMP modules express all IFF addresses
                                  using hexadecimal radix. The address is always
                                  padded with leading zeros to a standard field
                                  width of 8 characters.

            <PACKAGE> utilities use the VMS Command Line Interpreter (CLI) to  get
            and  parse the program command line.  <PACKAGE> utilities thus offer a
            VMS emulating user interface.  Unfortunately the VMS  Digital  Command
            Language  (DCL)  does  not support the real (or "floating point") data
            type.  Many <PACKAGE> utilities require real value arguments  for  the
            specification   of   tolerances  and  distances  etc.   To  meet  this
            requirement, Laser-Scan have developed an enhanced CLI  based  command
            line  decoding  mechanism.  This enables the interpretation of numbers
            as either "real" or "integer".  Throughout this  document  the  number
            types  are  differentiated  by the words 'integer' for integer numbers
            and 'real' for real (or "floating point") numbers.

            <PACKAGE> command line decoding operates in decimal radix.

            Within the VAX/VMS system IFF files can be treated as any  other  file
            type  for file management purposes.  To enable the user to distinguish
            an IFF file from a file of another type IFF files have by default  the
            file extension '.IFF'.  To provide great flexibility in the production
            environment IFF files are referenced  by  all  the  <PACKAGE>  modules
            using  logical name LSL$IF:.  (For an explanation of logical names see
            the VAX/VMS document set).  Logical name LSL$IF:   is  assigned  to  a
            device and directory specification either using the VMS DEFINE command
            or the Laser-Scan SI utility.

            Like VMS utilities, all <PACKAGE> modules generate VMS format messages
            and  set  VMS  DCL  symbol  $STATUS on image exit.  This is a valuable
            feature as a  non-interactive  process  can  test  the  success  of  a
            preceding  <PACKAGE> module before proceeding.  $STATUS will always be
            set to a VMS 32 bit condition code.  Successful program execution will
            result  in  $STATUS  being  set  to  SS$_NORMAL.  If an error occurred
            during <PACKAGE> processing, SS$_ABORT of varying severities, or a VMS
            System  or CLI (Command Line Interpreter) condition code will be used.
            The user may simply test $STATUS  for  TRUE  or  FALSE  within  a  DCL
            command procedure.  If $STATUS is TRUE then processing was successful.
            If it is FALSE, an error occurred during processing.  For  a  detailed
            description of the uses of $STATUS see the VAX VMS document set.

            Once logged in the user must  give  two  commands  to  initialise  the
            <PACKAGE>  package.   Before  the  <PACKAG>  package  can  be used DCL
            symbols and logical names must be  assigned  to  enable  the  user  to
            invoke   the   modules.   This  is  dome  using  a  command  procedure
            <PACKAGE>INI.COM which is supplied as part of the  <PACKAGE>  package.
            <PACKAGE>INI  itself  will be defined as a DCL symbol at your site and
            should  be  invoked  thus:   (see  the  PREFACE  for  explanation   of
            presentation conventions)

                  $ [1m<PACKAGE>INI<CR>[0m

            The <PACKAGE>INI command invokes a command procedure which  defines  a
            DCL symbol (the module name) for each of the <PACKAGE> modules.  After
            using <PACKAGE>INI the user need only type the symbol name to activate


  INTRODUCTION                                                            Page 1-2


            the required module.

            As an alternative to explicitly typing the <PACKAGE>INI  command  each
            time  the  user  wishes to use the <PACKAGE> package, the <PACKAGE>INI
            command may be placed  in  the  users  login  file,  or  in  the  site
            dependent default login file.

            The second command which must be  given  before  using  the  <PACKAGE>
            package  is  the  SI command.  The SI command assigns the logical name
            LSL$IF:  (or IF:  for short)  to  the  device-directory  specification
            which  contains  the  IFF  file(s)  that  are  to be manipulated.  For
            example:

                      $ [1mSI[0m [1mDUA3:[BUREAU.TRIALS.DIGITISING][0m

            This will assign logical name LSL$IF:  to  the  device  and  directory
            specification DUA3:[BUREAU.TRIALS.DIGITISING]

            All <PACKAGE> modules open  IFF  files  using  the  Laser-Scan  LSLLIB
            library  of  service routines.  This results in a standard set of four
            messages for successful IFF file opening and  three  primary  messages

            <PACKAGE> utilities use the VMS Command Line Interpreter (CLI) to  get
            and  parse the program command line.  <PACKAGE> utilities thus offer a
            VMS emulating user interface.  As  many  <PACKAGE>  utilities  require
            floating  point  arguments  to  command,  qualifiers  Laser-Scan  have
            developed an enhanced CLI based command line decoding mechanism.  This
            enables the interpretation of numbers as either "real" or "integer".

            The CLI allows the  user  to  specify  single  and  lists  of  integer
            qualifier  arguments.   If  a  list  of  arguments  is specified, each
            argument must be separated by a comma  and  the  whole  list  enclosed
            within parentheses, for example:

            Single argument:

                    $ [1mEXAMPLE/QUALIFIER=7<CR>[0m

                    Where "EXAMPLE" is the command and /QUALIFIER is  a  qualifier
                    to that command.  There is one qualifier argument  -  7

            Argument list:

                    $ [1mEXAMPLE/QUALIFIER=(2,5,8,9,10,11,12,13,14)<CR>[0m

                    Where "EXAMPLE" is the command and /QUALIFIER is  a  qualifier
                    to  that  command.  There are 9 qualifier arguments within the
                    argument list.

            While developing the  floating  point  command  line  data  type  (see
            Preface)  it  was  recognised  that  there is a need for numeric range
            decoding within a VMS emulating command  line.   Argument  ranges  are
            specified with the syntax:

                    [1mn:m[0m

                    Where n is the lower limit of the range and  m  is  the  upper
                    limit of the range (inclusive).


  INTRODUCTION                                                            Page 1-5


            Such ranges are expanded in full.  A maximum of 1024 arguments can  be
            specified to any one command qualifier.

            If we take our example argument list used above, i.e:

                    $ [1mEXAMPLE/QUALIFIER=(2,5,8,9,10,11,12,13,14)<CR>[0m

            and now use the Laser-Scan argument range decoding mechanism:

                    $ [1mEXAMPLE/QUALIFIER=(2,5,8:14)<CR>[0m

            we see that a more compact command line results but  yields  the  same
            arguments.   This  is  clearly  an  advantage in an IFF map processing
            environment where a single file could contain hundreds  of  attributes
            which the user may wish to reference via command line arguments.

            Other examples are:

                    $ [1mEXAMPLE/QUALIFIER=2:9<CR>[0m

                    This yields 8 integer arguments:  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9


                    $ [1mEXAMPLE/QUALIFIER=:8<CR>[0m

                    This yields 9 integer arguments:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  and
                    8

            If when ranges are decoded, a qualifier has more than  1024  arguments
            the Laser-Scan LSLLIB library issues the error message:

               %LSLLIB-E-RESPARSOVF, result of parse overflowed buffer

            and program execution is terminated.

            Floating point value ranges are  decoded  in  a  different  manner  to
            integer value ranges.  Instead of expanding the range to yield all its
            component integer values the command decoder merely leaves  the  range
            as a lower limit and an upper limit.  Processing then takes account of
            any possible value lying between these limits (inclusive).

            For example:

                    $ [1mISELECT/HEIGHT=(23.5:110.2)<CR>[0m

                    Select all features having a  height  which  lies  within  the
                    range 23.5 to 110.2 inclusive.
