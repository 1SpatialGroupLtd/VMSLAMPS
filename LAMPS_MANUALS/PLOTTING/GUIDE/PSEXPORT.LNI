            This document describes the PostScript export utility PSEXPORT.   This
            program  is  used  to translate the PostScript plot output produced by
            Laser-Scan plotting software into other formats for  export.   Formats
            currently   supported  are  Adobe  Illustrator  88,  and  Encapsulated
            PostScript.

            See the document "FPP Plotters User Guide, PostScript" in the PLOTTING
            package  documentation  for  information on generating PostScript plot
            file using Laser-Scan plotting software (FPP and LITES2).

            Note that the format of  PostScript  output  generated  by  Laser-Scan
            software    is    liable    to   change   in   future   releases   (of
            GKSPOSTSCRIPTSHR.EXE).  PSEXPORT is intended to  work  only  with  the
            current  format.   A  new  version  will be released if format changes
            would cause it no longer  to  work.   Any  such  new  version  is  not
            guaranteed  to  work  with plot files produced by previous releases of
            software.

            For some output formats, care must be taken with  the  format  of  the
            parts  of  the  PostScript file which can be specified directly by the
            user, for example colour tables in the LSL$PS_HEADER file, or fonts in
            the LSL$PS_FONTLIST file.  These details are explained in the sections
            below for each output format.

            Adobe Illustrator 88 format is intended  for  import  into  the  Adobe
            Illustrator  family of software.  The format is described in the Adobe
            Systems document "Adobe Illustrator Document  Format,  Specification",
            available  on  request  from  Adobe  Systems Inc.  Data in this format
            cannot be sent to a PostScript printer without being imported and then
            saved by Adobe Illustrator.  The file extension of the output defaults
            to .AI.

            Much  of  the  PostScript  produced  by  GKSPOSTSCRIPTSHR  is  already
            suitable  for  this  purpose, but PSEXPORT has to make some changes to
            the file.  The first line of the output file is:

            %!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2

            The second line is  the  %%BoundingBox  header  comment,  obtained  by
            searching  the  input  file  for  such a comment containing the actual
            bounding values, and not the directive (atend).  This is followed by a
            %%TemplateBox  header  comment  specifying  a single point area in the
            centre of the bounding box.

            This completes the Prolog section of the output file.  The input  file
            is then searched for a %%BeginSetup comment, and any colours and fonts
            defined are then processed (see below) until the %%EndSetup comment is
            found.

            PSEXPORT then searches for an %%EndPageSetup  comment,  and  processes
            the plot data (see below) until either the %%Trailer or %%Page comment
            is found (in the latter case, the subsequent pages are skipped).   The
            output file is then ended by adding a %%Trailer comment.

            Colour definitions  in  the  Setup  section  of  the  input  file  are
            recognised provided that they are in the form:

            COLTAB n {r g b setrgbcolor} put

            where n is the colour index, and r g  b  are  the  colour  components.
            This  is  the  format  produced  from the colour table on logical name
            LSL$PS_COLOUR.  If the user specifies their own colour  table  in  the
            file  on  logical name LSL$PS_HEADER, then it will still work provided
            that the above format is adhered to.  The forms:

            COLTAB n {c m y k setcmykcolor} put, and
            COLTAB n {g setgray} put

            may be used also.

            Font definitions in the Setup section of the input file are recognised
            provided that they are in the form:

            FNTDICT begin /Fn {
            /Times-Roman findfont
            1.5 scalefont


  PSEXPORT - User Guide                                                     Page 6


            ...optional other stuff...
            } def end

            where n is the font number, Times-Roman is the font name, and the  1.5
            is  a  scale  factor  (the  scalefont  line is optional).  This is the
            format  produced  using  information  in  the  file  on  logical  name
            LSL$PS_FONTLIST  (provided that any FIND directives use a form similar
            to the findfont line above).  If the user specifies their own fonts in
            the  file  on  logical  name  LSL$PS_HEADER, then they will still work
            provided that the above format is adhered to.

            The steps involved in processing the actual plot data are:

             o  Skip any 'restore' and 'showpage' operators.

             o  Skip any circles and arcs  ('AA'  or  'AC')  and  produce  warning
                message.   These are not allowed in AI88 format.  The PS file will
                only include these if the hardware flag is set in the FRT file for
                circle or arc graphical types.

             o  Terminate the program if any raster images are found.   These  are
                not supported in AI88 format.

             o  Convert any colour settings ('k' or 'K') to use cmyk values rather
                than  indices.   The  'g' or 'G' operators are used instead if the
                colour represents a grey level.

             o  Convert any font settings ('z') to use the AI88 format.

             o  Convert any texts ('e' and 't') to use the AI88 format.

             o  Convert any pen up moves ('m') occurring in the middle of paths to
                stroke  out  the previous path and begin a new one.  Paths may not
                include pen up moves in AI88 format.


            The PostScript file is expected to contain 'u' and 'U' markers at  the
            beginning  and end of features.  Adobe Illustrator uses these to group
            items into an object.  These same markers are also used for groups  of
            features.   See  the PostScript chapter of the Plotters User Guide for
            details.

            Note that Adobe Illustrator  fills  areas  in  the  same  way  as  the
            PostScript operator 'fill' (non-zero winding rule), whereas PostScript
            produced by Laser-Scan software uses 'eofill' (even-odd  rule).   This
            could  result in areas with holes drawing differently depending on how
            the boundary is constructed.

            Encapsulated PostScript format  is  intended  to  be  included  within
            another  document  by other utilities.  The format is described in the
            EPSF section  of  the  Adobe  Systems  document  "PostScript  Language
            Reference  Manual",  available  as  ISBN  0-201-18127-4.  Data in this
            format is still valid PostScript, and may also be sent directly  to  a
            PostScript  printer.   The  file  extension  of the output defaults to

            .EPS.

            PSEXPORT makes few changes to the input file  for  this  format.   The
            first line of the output file is:

            %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0

            The second line is  the  %%BoundingBox  header  comment,  obtained  by
            searching  the  input  file  for  such a comment containing the actual
            bounding values, and not the  directive  (atend).   After  these,  the
            input  file is copied unchanged, except that any %!PS or %%BoundingBox
            lines are omitted.

  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
