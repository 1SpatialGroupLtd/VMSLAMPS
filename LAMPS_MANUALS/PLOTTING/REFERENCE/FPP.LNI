  1  [3mIntroduction[0m

  The  Fast  Plotter  Program  (FPP)  is  designed  for   producing   high-quality
  cartographic  plots  from  Laser-scan  Internal Feature Format data (IFF). It is
  capable of generating line patterns, thick lines, area fill, complex symbols and
  texts.  It uses the new Feature Representation Table (FRT) mechanism for finding
  the graphical representation  for  feature  codes.  FPP  supports  the  new  GKS
  (Graphical  Kernel  System)  graphics  standard  which gives it a high degree of
  device independence.

  FPP is available in versions to support a wide variety of  output  devices.  See
  the FPP Software Product Specification for details.



  2  [3mEnvironment[0m

  FPP was written for use on VAX-11 computers  running  under  the  VMS  operating
  system.

  There are 3 main types of input files which may be used by the program:-

       1.  IFF files hold the actual cartographic data. There are various ways  of
           holding  map data in IFF format and the user should be aware of the way
           that FPP interprets  it  (see  section  on  IFF  Interpretation).  Full
           information  on  IFF  can be obtained from the 'IFF User Guide', in the
           MAPPING package documentation.

       2.  FRT files are the means of defining the graphical  image  required  for
           each feature. Each feature code used in the IFF file must have an entry
           in the FRT table. Definitions of patterned lines and feature code group
           names  are also set up in the FRT file. The FRT file is equivalent to a
           map legend so a different one  would  normally  be  required  for  each
           different map series. Further information can be found in the 'FRT User
           Guide' in the MAPPING package documentation.

           The FRT file references special IFF files which are used for symbol and
           text  definitions.  These are the Symbol Representation Table (SRI) for
           symbols and the Text Representation Table (TRI) for text.

       3.  FPP command files are a shorthand means of specifying commands to  FPP.
           A  sequence  of  commands  likely  to be used frequently can be grouped
           together in a command file. This is read by the program on request.  If
           the  logical name LSL$FPPINI is set up to point to a command file, then
           this file will be obeyed automatically when FPP is run.


  Each type of file is held in a particular directory on  a  particular  disk.  As
  these  are  likely  to be different for each installation, the program refers to
  them using logical device names:-
          [3mFile[0m [3mType[0m               [3mLogical[0m [3mName[0m

          IFF                     LSL$IF
          FRT                     LSL$FRT
          FPP Command File        LSL$FPP


  FPP Reference Manual                                                      Page 3


  The logical names LSL$TEXT_ROUTINE and/or LSL$SYMBOL_ROUTINE may be set to point
  to shared images that can be used to draw texts and symbols differently from the
  standard FRT routines used by FPP. More details of this facility  are  available
  in the LITES2 Reference Manual.

  When areas are filled using software, rather than hardware  the  size  of  areas
  that  can  be handled are controlled by the logical names LSL$FILL_POINTSMAX and
  LSL$FILL_CUTSMAX. (See the device dependent FPP User Guide for  details  of  how
  your plotter handles fill areas)

  The logical name LSL$FILL_POINTSMAX allows the buffer size  to  be  set  to  the
  required  maximum  size  of  area.  The  default  value is 8192 points, with the
  minimum allowed being 100. Fill areas which  exceed  the  limit  for  number  of
  points  will  result  in  areas  not being filled, although they should still be
  drawn in outline, albeit with some invisible lines visible.

  Similarly the maximum number of times which a scan line may cross  the  boundary
  of an area may be controlled by defining the logical name LSL$FILL_CUTSMAX to be
  the required number. The default value is 100 intersections,  with  the  minimum
  allowed  being 10. Exceeding the limit for intersections will result in messages
  'FILL_SIDE - Too many intersections found - ignored'.

  Memory has to be allocated in proportion  to  these  numbers,  so  unnecessarily
  large values should be avoided.

  Sensible defaults logical names should be set up at each  installation  although
  individual users may set up their own.

  12. Areas.                                3 or more

  If a feature has an illegal number of points then an appropriate  error  message
  is  produced.  If  too few points were given then the feature is ignored. If too
  many points are given then the program attempts to plot the  feature  using  the
  first points only.

  If an empty feature is found (ie no IFF ST entry) then it is ignored.  No  error
  message is produced since this is a legal IFF construct.



  3.3  [3mLine[0m [3mfeatures[0m

  Line features may be line strings, circles/arcs or interpolated curves. They may
  be drawn as patterned lines and/or thick lines.



  3.3.1  [3mPatterned[0m [3mlines[0m

  A line feature will be drawn as a patterned line if the entry (corresponding  to
  the  feature  code)  in  the  FRT file has a secondary code. This secondary code
  specifies which pattern definition is required. A full  description  on  pattern
  definitions  can be found in the FRT Reference Manual though a brief description
  is given here:-

  The basic pattern consists of a major dash and a minor dash, both of  which  are
  optional.  The lengths of these and the period length are set in the FRT pattern
  definition. Repeat counts may be specified for one or both of these  though  the
  lengths  of  the  dashes  specified in the FRT definition should take account of
  such repeats. Repeat counts are extra counts (ie. in addition to the  1st  one).
  It is illegal for the sum of the dash lengths to exceed the period length.

  Symbols defined in the SRI file may be substituted for the dashes. The  size  of
  these  symbols  is set by the width entries in the FRT pattern definition and is
  completely independent of the dash length.

  If the symbol specified is found not to exist or fails to plot sensibly, then an
  error message is output and subsequent occurrences of it within that feature are
  suppressed. If the FRT pattern definition does not make sense or if it  contains
  illegal  values  (eg.  negatives), then the feature attempting to use it will be
  ignored and an error message printed.

  The individual bits in the flag word in the FRT pattern can be used  to  specify
  that:

       1.  the pattern should be scaled to fit the feature exactly

       2.  the pattern should restart at each vertex of the line

       3.  the symbols for every other dash should be inverted


  FPP Reference Manual                                                      Page 5


       4.  the symbols should be drawn horizontal, irrespective of  the  direction
           of the line

       5.  the symbols should be drawn using the hardware, not from the definition
           in the SRI

       6.  the symbols should be stretched if the pattern is scaled

       7.  scale to fit whole units, rather than entire pattern repeats




  3.3.2  [3mThick[0m [3mlines[0m

  Line thickness is set by the FRT width value.  If  this  value  is  0  then  the
  default  width  (single  line)  is  assumed.  The dashes in patterned lines also
  assume thicknesses from the FRT width entry.



  3.4  [3mSymbol[0m [3mfeatures[0m

  Symbol features may take angles or size values depending on their  feature  type
  and  whether  there  was an IFF RO (rotation) entry given and/or an alignment (2
  points in an ST entry).

  Symbols may either be plotted using the plotter  hardware  or  from  the  symbol
  definitions  held  in  the  SRI  file.  The plotter hardware is used to plot the
  symbol if the bottom bit of the flags word in the FRT for the symbol is set (and
  the  plotter  has  the  capability).  When  using  the  plotter hardware to draw
  symbols, the symbol number is taken from the H/W entry in the  FRT;  when  using
  the SRI mechanism the symbol number is taken from the secondary code entry.

  Unoriented symbols and symbol strings (multiple unoriented symbols) do not  take
  any  angle.  Oriented and scaled symbols take angles defined by the RO entry. If
  no RO entry is given then the alignment, if any, is  used.  The  default  symbol
  angle is 0 (ie. upright symbols).

  Unoriented and oriented symbols and symbol strings have a size set  by  the  FRT
  size  value.  Scaled  symbols have a size defined by the alignment (the 2 points
  define the unity length of the symbol). If no alignment for a scaled  symbol  is
  given  then  an  error  message is produced and the FRT size is used. If the FRT
  size is 0 then an error message is output and a default of 5 is used.

  Symbol definitions held in the  SRI  file  are  held  in  normalised  form.  All
  coordinates  in it must be in the range -1 to +1. It is the unit length which is
  scaled up to the required symbol size. For example, a centred symbol (using  the
  full  range -1 to +1) of size 5, would be drawn as -5 to +5 around its centre. A
  symbol such as an arrow which wants to rotate about its point would  be  defined
  in  the  range 0 to 1 (the arrow point at coordinate 0,0). If given size 5, then
  this would be drawn as 0 to 5.


  FPP Reference Manual                                                      Page 6


  3.5  [3mText[0m [3mfeatures[0m

  The IFF RO entry is used to set the text angle. If there is no RO entry then any
  alignment is used. Failing this, the text is drawn horizontally.

  By default, text is justified to the position stored in the FS entry (a value in
  the  range 0-8), but this feature can be turned off, when all text is positioned
  by its lower left corner.

  Text features usually take a height from the FRT size entry. If this is  0  then
  an error message is produced and a default size of 5 is used.

  Alternatively the height may be obtained from the TH entry in the IFF  file.  By
  default,  the  value is taken to be a point size, and if it is not a legal point
  size the default value of 24 is used. It is also possible to read the  value  of
  the TH entry as 100ths of mm.

  Different fonts can be used in the same plot by using the FRT secondary code  to
  hold  the  font  number  (see FRT Reference Manual). Different fonts are held in
  different layers of the TRI file.

  If the FRT secondary code is negative,  then  its  absolute  value  is  used  to
  identify the font number, but the text is plotted in its italic form.



  3.6  [3mArea[0m [3mfeatures[0m

  Area features may be drawn hollow, solid, hatched or patterned, according to the
  value of the secondary code in the FRT file (see FRT Reference Manual). Briefly,
  -1 gives solid, 0 gives hollow, and positive numbers give various hatch  styles.
  Secondary  codes  less than -1 relate to area fill patterns which are defined in
  terms of hatched patterned lines.

  For drawing hatched styles, the line width and hatch spacing are taken from  the
  width  and size entries in the FRT entry. If both these are 0.0 then the default
  values of 0.0 (minimum line width) and 5.0 (5.0 mm spacing) are used.

  The values from the FRT can be overridden by using the +HATCH command, which can
  also be used to reset the line width and spacing values.

  See details of the logical names LSL$FILL_POINTSMAX and LSL$FILL_CUTSMAX (above)
  for controlling the maximum size of area that can be drawn.

  The system is normally set up so that the program is initiated by typing  'FPP',
  or  where  several  versions  are  available,  possibly  FPPxxx where xxx is the
  particular version name. Sometimes FPP is run from a command file which  ensures
  that  the  appropriate output device is assigned and set up. A typical run could
  be:-

  $ FPP

  FPP (LP) V2.0 of 18:55:26 25-NOV-1988

  4.1  [3mMore[0m [3mdetails[0m

  Whatever method is used for invoking FPP, it will eventually result in an  image
  file LSL$EXE:FPPxxx.EXE being run, where xxx is the appropriate device type e.g.
  LP for Laserplot. In most cases this image will be a small initialisation  image
  (around  10  blocks  in size) which sets up logical names and defaults, and then
  invokes the main image LSL$EXE:FPPSHR.EXE (around  300  blocks).  This  in  turn
  invokes  the  appropriate  GKS  driver  image  LSL$EXE:GKSxxxSHR.EXE  (around 50
  blocks). Some of the versions driving  devices  with  a  family  resemblance  to
  Calcomp  pen  plotters  use  GKSHCBSSHR.EXE  which  in turn calls upon a Calcomp
  lookalike driver image LSL$EXE:HCBSxxx.EXE (around 20 blocks). The driver images
  are located by logical name LSL$GKSSHR for the GKS driver, and LSL$HCBSSHARE for
  the Calcomp lookalike if required.  These  logical  names  are  set  up  by  the
  initialisation  program, so the images must reside in the search list LSL$EXE if
  this is to work (the logical names are set up in user  mode,  and  so  disappear
  again  at  the  end  of  the  run).  It  is possible to set up the logical names
  manually and then run FPPSHR directly if required, but it may then be  necessary
  to  give  a  WORKSTATION command to set the workstation type, as the default may
  not be correct. The image  FPPHCBS  runs  FPPSHR  with  LSL$GKSSHR  pointing  to
  LSL$EXE:GKSHCBSSHR.EXE,  but leaves the user to point logical name LSL$HCBSSHARE
  to the appropriate Calcomp lookalike driver image.



  5  [3mCommands[0m

  Commands may  be  given  in  their  full  form  (as  listed  below),  or  in  an
  abbreviated,  unambiguous  form.  They  may  be  given  singly or in groups on a
  command line.

  Commands may be given directly, or they may be given via a command file. Command
  files may contain any number of commands. They are called using the form:-

                  @filename

  Any parts of the filename not supplied will be taken from the default:

                  LSL$FPP:FPP.COM

  Such files are useful where the same sequence of commands is needed often.

  If running FPP interactively (in particular, when SYS$COMMAND is a terminal) the
  CTRL/C  (pressing  the  CTRL and C keys simultaneously) may be used to terminate
  the plotting of an IFF file. CTRL/C is treated as though the  end  of  file  had

  5.1  [3mCommand[0m [3mlist[0m

  The FPP commands follow in alphabetical order:

       1.  ADVANCE/CLEAR [i]
           Advance the film by i (default 1) frames (if the hardware allows this),
           or  clear  screen.  If  this  command is given before the first plot is
           started (for instance to load a diazo into the HRD) then the action  is
           not performed until plotting starts.

       2.  ANNOTATION subcommand
           Set the characteristics for annotations (labels).

              ANNOTATION ANGLE [r]
              Specifies the angle of labelling (in degrees). If r is missing, then
              align labels with feature (default).

              ANNOTATION COLOUR [i]
              Selects the colour (pen) used for labels. If i  is  missing,  or  is
              less  than or equal to zero, then use the same colour as the feature
              being labelled (default).

              ANNOTATION FONT i
              Selects the font used for labels. The font must  exist  in  the  TRI
              file. By default, font 1 is used.

              ANNOTATION HWTEXT [n]
              Attempt to use hardware facilities to draw  labelling  text  (rather
              then  using  the character shapes from the TRI file). The default is
              not to use hardware text. Hardware text is enabled if n  is  missing
              or 1, disabled if n is 0.

              ANNOTATION OFFSET r1 r2
              Specifies an x and y label offset (in mm). Default is no offset.

              ANNOTATION SIZE r
              Specifies the size of labels. By default, a size of 3mm is used.

       3.  [+/-]CENTRE
           Centre (+CENTRE) the plot within the drawing area (default), or plot in
           the  bottom left corner (-CENTRE). +CENTRE is equivalent to POSITION 4,
           and -CENTRE to POSITION 0 (qv).

       4.  [+/-]CLIP
           Clip (+CLIP) the plot at the range value (either from the  RAnge  entry
           in the IFF file, or from the WINDOW command (qv). The default is not to
           clip.
           CLIP is useful in conjunction with WINDOW to selectively plot part of a
           file.

       5.  CONTOUR subcommand
           Specifies various options for drawing contours


  FPP Reference Manual                                                      Page 9


              CONTOUR INDEX i1 i2
              Specifies the index contour interval (i1) and selects the colour  or
              pen (i2) to be used for plotting all index contours.
              Cancels any CONTOUR LEVEL or CONTOUR INTERVAL commands.

              CONTOUR INTERVAL i1 i2
              Defines the contour interval (i1), and causes a repeated sequence of
              i2 colours (pens) to be used in plotting contours.
              Cancels any CONTOUR LEVEL or CONTOUR INDEX commands.

              CONTOUR LEVEL i1,i2 i3
              Defines a range of contour values (i1 to i2), and the  colour  (pen)
              to be used in plotting any contour that falls within the range.
              E.g. CONTOUR LEVEL 0,400 1 will cause any contour with a height of 0
              to 400 inclusive to be plotted with pen 1.
              Up to 100 ranges may be specified. Any contour not lying within  one
              of the given ranges will not be plotted.
              Cancels any CONTOUR INDEX or CONTOUR INTERVAL commands.

              CONTOUR RESET
              Cancels all contour selections.

              [+/-]CONTOUR SELECT
              +CONTOUR SELECT Causes only the index contours to be plotted.
              -CONTOUR  SELECT  Deselects  the  index  contour   plotting   option
              (default)
              This command should be used in conjunction with  the  CONTOUR  INDEX
              command

              CONTOUR VALUE i1 i2
              Allows the selective plotting of a contour value (i1) using a  given
              colour  (i2).  Equivalent  to  CONTOUR  LEVEL (qv) with a range of a
              single value.
              Cancels any CONTOUR INDEX or CONTOUR INTERVAL commands.

       6.  DESELECT subcommand
           Specifies features not to plot
           The same subcommands are valid as for SELECT  (qv)  are  valid,  except
           ALL, and AC CANCEL.

       7.  DISABLE subcommand
           Switches off various options. Same subcommands as ENABLE (qv).

       8.  ENABLE subcommand
           Switches on various options

              ENABLE ABSOLUTE
              Take the coordinates specified in a WINDOW command to be in absolute
              IFF  units (including any origin offset contained in the IFF files).
              By default, WINDOW coordinates are specified in IFF units  local  to
              each IFF file. Any window is cancelled by this command.

              ENABLE BOX
              Draw texts as their bounding boxes, rather than as a text string.
              These boxes will be drawn in the text colour, with a solid  line  of
              minimum line width.


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 10


              This feature is disabled by default.

              ENABLE DESCRIPTOR
              Take map scale and offset from the IFF Map Descriptor (MD) entry, in
              preference to the Map Header (MH) entry (default).

              ENABLE HEIGHT
              Take text height from the TH entry in the IFF file. By default  text
              sizes are taken from the FRT file.

              ENABLE HWTEXT
              Attempt to use hardware facilities to draw text (rather  then  using
              the  character  shapes  from  the  TRI file) if the FRT hardware bit
              appears in the flags entry for a  text  feature  code.  The  default
              setting  for  this option varies according to the plotting device in
              use. See the Plotters User Guide for details  of  whether  a  device
              supports  hardware  text.  Attempts to use hardware text on a device
              which does not support it will result in text not appearing at all.

              ENABLE LOG [n]
              Causes a message  to  be  displayed  as  each  feature  is  plotted,
              enabling  an  approximate  check  on  progress  to  be  made. If the
              optional argument is given, then the message is displayed after each
              n features. Disabled by default.

              ENABLE INTERPOLATION
              Draw graphical type 6  features  as  interpolated  curves  (default)
              using   the   currently  selected  algorithm  (see  INTERPOLATE  and
              TOLERANCE commands).

              ENABLE PATTERN
              Allow generation of patterned lines and  fill  areas  (default).  If
              disabled,  then  draw  all  lines  solid and patterned fill areas as
              hatched.

              ENABLE PSIZE
              If ENABLE HEIGHT in force, then take the text sizes in  the  IFF  TH
              entry to be in points (default). If disabled, then the size is taken
              to be in 1/100 mm.

              ENABLE POSITIONING
              Position text according to the justification code  (0-8)  stored  in
              the  FS  entry (default). If disabled, then position all text by its
              lower left corner.

              ENABLE REPORT
              By default, layer numbers, TC lines, messages of number of  features
              found,  and  timing information are output during plotting. This can
              be switched off by DISABLE REPORT. Error messages are always output.

              ENABLE SORT
              Draw features using their multiple prioritised  representation  held
              in the FRT. This will involve a pre-pass of the IFF file in order to
              build up a list in memory of  feature  representation  parts  to  be
              drawn.  The  list is then sorted by priority and each part output in
              turn.


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 11


              ENABLE THICK
              Allow generation of thick lines (default) if the  hardware  permits.
              If  disabled,  then draw all lines are draw at the nominal thickness
              (thin).

       9.  ENLARGE r
           Scaling factor (real number) required to enlarge the film  plot  up  to
           full  size  (default  1). N.B. The command ENLARGE 2 will make the plot
           half the size it otherwise would have been, to allow for the subsequent
           enlargement.  This  command is the only method to scale the entire plot
           while retaining the relative size of texts, symbols, and linework.

      10.  ESCAPE escid
           Used to communicate a  device  dependent  function  to  the  particular
           output  device  in use. See the Plotters User Guide for details of what
           functions are available.

           FPPCAL5800, FPPVRSVGS, FPPBEN3000, FPPPI448 - escid = 1 uses a  drawing
                 mode  in  which  the things drawn subsequently are opaque (things
                 drawn already do not show through). escid = 2 uses a drawing mode
                 in  which  everything drawn is superimposed (the inks are mixed).
                 If necessary, then draw the file with some selections  in  force,
                 then  change  the  selections,  give the ESCAPE command, and draw
                 again.

      11.  EXIT/QUIT
           Exit from the program. CTRL/Z or end of input has the same effect.

      12.  FRT filename
           Specifies the FRT (feature representation table) file.

      13.  GO
           Used in conjunction with the PAUSE command to start plotting again when
           the  program has stopped between layers or after the required number of
           features.

      14.  [+/-]HATCH [width separation]
           The line width and line separation of hatched and patterned  fill  area
           features  are  taken from the width and size entries in the FRT for the
           feature code of the feature. If both these are  0.0  then  the  default
           values of 0.0 and 5.0 mm are used.
           The +HATCH command overrides the data from the FRT and uses the default
           values.
           The -HATCH command returns to  the  default  condition  of  only  using
           default values for features with 0.0 entries in the FRT.
           If arguments are given with the command then these values are  used  as
           the defaults.
           For symbols and texts that have components that are  hollow,  solid  or
           hatched fill areas, the width and size entries in the corresponding SCT
           are used to define the width and separation to be used. Entries of  0.0
           mean  that  the default values are to be used. These default values are
           affected by the HATCH command, but it is not possible to  override  the
           values in the SCT.

      15.  HEIGHT subcommand
           Defines the location of contour height values.  Correct  definition  is
           essential if CONTOUR commands are to operate correctly.


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 12


              HEIGHT AC
              Height value is stored as a type 3 AC (default).

              HEIGHT FSN/NF
              Height value is stored as the FSN.

      16.  HELP [topic]
           Gives help on FPP commands. If no  topic  is  given,  then  a  list  of
           commands is output.

      17.  IFF filename
           Specifies  the  IFF  data  file  to  be   plotted.   If   running   FPP
           interactively,  then  the  plot  may  be terminated part way through by
           pressing CTRL/C.

      18.  INTERPOLATE subcommand
           Set the interpolation  algorithm  to  be  used  for  graphical  type  6
           features  if  ENABLE  INTERPOLATION  is in force. Tolerances can be set
           using TOLERANCE CURDRAW.

              INTERPOLATE AKIMA
              Use  Akima  curve  interpolation,  a  bicubic  spline  method  which
              preserves linearity if possible (default).

              INTERPOLATE MCCONALOGUE
              Use McConalogue curve interpolation, a circular arc pair method.

      19.  LABEL subcommand
           Sets up labelling of features with various attributes.
           When an AC to be labelled is explicitly specified, the AC type  can  be
           given as a name or as the corresponding integer.

              [+/-]LABEL AC type
              Enable/disable labelling of features with the value of the specified
              AC.  The  format  of the value displayed depends on the data type of
              the AC.

              [+/-]LABEL ACINT type
              Enable/disable labelling of features with the value (treated  as  an
              integer) of the specified AC.
              This command is now redundant. LABEL AC should be used instead.

              [+/-]LABEL ACREAL type
              Enable/disable labelling of features with the value  (treated  as  a
              real value) of the specified AC.
              This command is now redundant. LABEL AC should be used instead.

              [+/-]LABEL ACTEXT type
              Enable/disable labelling of features with the text of the  specified
              AC.

              [+/-]LABEL CONTOUR
              Enable/disable labelling with the (integer) value of the contour AC.
              This is the same as LABEL AC Contour.


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 13


              [+/-]LABEL FC
              Enable/disable labelling with feature code.

              [+/-]LABEL FSN/NF
              Enable/disable labelling with feature serial number

              [+/-]LABEL HEIGHT
              Enable/disable labelling with the (real) value  of  the  height  AC.
              This is the same as LABEL AC Height.

              [+/-]LABEL INDEX
              Enable/disable labelling of index contours. If  enabled,  then  only
              feature  whose  height are multiples of the contour interval will be
              labelled.
              Note: this command must be used  in  conjunction  with  the  CONTOUR
              INDEX command

              [+/-]LABEL LH
              Enable/disable labelling with the text of the Left Hand Boundary AC.
              This is the same as LABEL ACTEXT LH_boundary.

              LABEL NONE
              Cancel all labelling attributes.

              [+/-]LABEL RH
              Enable/disable labelling with the text of the  Right  Hand  Boundary
              AC. This is the same as LABEL ACTEXT RH_boundary.

      20.  NOOVERRIDE
           Cancel the effect of OVERRIDE (qv).

      21.  OFFSET r1 r2
           Offset the whole plot by (r1,r2) mm on the enlarged plot.
           Default is no offset.

      22.  ORIGIN r1 r2
           Offset the whole plot by (r1,r2) in IFF units.
           Default is no offset.

      23.  OVERRIDE i1 i2
           Overrides the feature code entries for all  items  in  a  layer,  by  a
           specified  feature  code,  where  i1 is the layer number, and i2 is the
           required feature  code.  Up  to  256  such  pairs  may  be  given.  Use
           NOOVERRIDE (qv) to cancel the settings.

      24.  [+/-]PAUSE subcommand
           Causes plotting to pause part way  through  until  the  GO  command  is
           given.

              [+/-]PAUSE FEATURE [i]
              Pause plotting after i features. -PAUSE FEATURE cancels  a  previous
              PAUSE  FEATURE command. After plotting has paused, the PAUSE command
              must be repeated if required. The number of features after which  to
              pause  defaults  to the same number as used last time (initially 1).
              When prioritised drawing is enabled using  ENABLE  SORT,  the  PAUSE
              FEATURE command will pause after i feature REPRESENTATIONS.

              [+/-]PAUSE LAYER
              Pause before each selected layer and  prompt  for  commands.  -PAUSE
              LAYER  cancels  a previous PAUSE LAYER command, the rest of the file
              being plotted without interruption. PAUSE LAYER enables the  scaling
              information  to  be  checked before the first layer starts to plot -
              the program can be stopped if it is wrong. The PAUSE  LAYER  command
              does  not  work  when performing prioritised drawing except to pause
              after the header is read but before feature are processed.

      25.  POSITION i
           Set the plotting position within the drawing area. Position 0 is bottom
           left, 1 is centre left, 2 is top left, 3 is bottom centre, and so on up
           to 8 which is top right. The default is position 4 (centre).  See  also
           the CENTRE command.

      26.  [+/-]ROTATE [r]
           [+]ROTATE r rotates the plot r degrees counter clockwise.  The  default
           value of r is -90 degrees.
           -ROTATE returns to normal orientation and any argument is ignored.

      27.  SCALE subcommand
           Sets scaling for the plot.

              SCALE AUTO
              Specifies that automatic scaling to fill up the available film  area
              is required.

              SCALE FACTOR r
              Explicit scaling factor (real) to convert IFF units into mm  on  the
              final enlarged plot.

              SCALE IFF r
              Defines the IFF units. The real value is the  number  of  ground  mm
              represented by 1 IFF unit.

              SCALE SHEET r
              Defines the scale of the required plot (eg. 50000). The value is the
              number  of  ground units represented by one sheet unit. This command
              is used in conjunction with the SCALE IFF command.

      28.  SELECT subcommand
           Selects which features to plot

              SELECT AC type [subcommand]
              Allows selection by ancillary code (AC) entries in features. The  AC
              type  may  be  either  an integer, the corresponding name defined by
              Laser-Scan, or  a  name  defined  by  the  user  in  the  FRT  file.
              Selections for different AC types are logically ANDed together, so a
              feature must satisfy [3mall[0m the selection criteria to be selected.

                 SELECT AC type CANCEL
                 Cancels all selections based on the given AC type.  The  DESELECT
                 command may not be used with CANCEL.

                 SELECT AC type [PRESENT]
                 Features must have an AC of the specified  type.  The  value  and
                 text  of  the  AC  are  not  considered.  PRESENT  is the default


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 15


                 subcommand for the  SELECT  AC  command,  and  may  therefore  be
                 omitted.
                 The command DESELECT AC type PRESENT implies that  features  must
                 [3mnot[0m have an AC of the specified type.

                 SELECT AC type TEXT [ [inequality] val1 [val2] ]
                 Allows selection according to the contents of  the  AC  text.  If
                 just  a text string is specified (in double quotes if it contains
                 spaces), then features will be selected if they contain an AC  of
                 the  specified type whose text contains the given string (or does
                 not contain the string for a DESELECT command). If an  inequality
                 and value(s) are given (as for the SELECT AC type VALUE command),
                 then the given text string within the AC text  must  be  followed
                 immediately  by  a  numerical  value  in  the selected range. The
                 datatype of the value may only be integer.  A  null  text  string
                 (specified  by  "")  followed  by  a  value  or  range  of values
                 indicates that the numerical value occurs at the start of the  AC
                 text.
                 Example: SELECT AC DFAD_FADT TEXT fid 25
                          Features must contain a DFAD_FADT type AC in  which  the
                          text contains the string "fid" followed by a value 25.

                 SELECT AC type VALUE [inequality] val1 [val2]
                 Allows selection according to the value contained in AC  entries.
                 Values  must  be  specified in the correct format (integer, real,
                 date, time, character) for the data type of the AC.
                 The inequality may be any of:   =     >    >=     <    <=    <>
                                with synonyms: .EQL. .GTR. .GEQ. .LSS. .LEQ. .NEQ.
                                          and:                   .LT.
                 Inequality  names  may  be  abbreviated.  If  the  inequality  is
                 omitted, then = is assumed. A range of values may be specified by
                 giving two values (omitting the  inequality,  or  specifying  =),
                 which  will  be taken to mean the range between and including the
                 two values. The command may be  repeated  to  specify  additional
                 values or ranges of values.
                 Example: SELECT AC HEIGHT VALUE >30.0 (height AC, value >30)
                          SELECT AC HEIGHT 10.0 20.0 (height AC, values 10 to 20)

              SELECT ALL
              Cancels all previous SELECT or DESELECT commands and results in  all
              features in the file being plotted.

              SELECT FC fc1 fc2 ... fcn
              where fcn can be a feature code (integer), a range of feature  codes
              or a feature code group name.
              Selects which feature codes should be plotted. SELECT FC must be the
              last command on a line since any following commands will be taken as
              group names.
              ALL, FC, FSN and LAYER may not be used as group names.

              SELECT FSN fsn1 fsn2 .... fsnn
              where fsn can be a feature serial number (integer)  or  a  range  of
              feature serial numbers.
              Selects which features should be plotted.

              SELECT LAYER lay1 lay2 .... layn
              where lay can be a layer  number  (integer)  or  a  range  of  layer
              numbers.
              Selects which layers should be plotted.

      29.  SEPARATOR ESCAPE escid
           Used to set up an ESCAPE function (see the  ESCAPE  command)  which  is
           performed  automatically  between each level of different priority when
           prioritised drawing is used. It is  intended  to  ensure  that  devices
           which normally plot in a transparent manner draw each priority level in
           a new opaque layer. The command should not normally be necessary  since
           a  default value of 1 is used on the devices for which this is relevant
           (CAL5800, VRSVGS, BEN3000, PI448).

      30.  SHOW subcommand
           Displays various settings.

              SHOW LABELS
              Displays the current labelling attributes

              SHOW SCALES
              Displays the scale which will be used to draw  the  next  IFF  file.
              Note that the sheet scale may be obtained from the map header in the
              file, in which case this may not be known.  Also  the  size  of  the
              drawing area will not be known unless a file has already been drawn.

              SHOW SELECTIONS
              Displays the currently selected layers, FSNs and FCs

              SHOW TOLERANCES
              Displays the settings of various tolerances

      31.  SRI filename
           Specifies the SRI (symbol representation IFF) file.

      32.  TITLE subcommand
           Allows the user to add titling to the plot. Simple primitives  to  draw
           lines  and  text  use  existing  feature  codes  to  define pen colour,
           thickness, text font, etc.
           NOTE: No titling can be  undertaken  until  the  first  plot  has  been
           produced using the IFF command.

              TITLE DISPLAY text
              Defines a text string <text> (from the first  non-spacing  character
              to  the  end  of  the  command  line)  that  may be displayed during
              plotting by some versions of the program.

              TITLE FC LINE i
              TITLE FC TEXT i
              Define the feature code to be used for lines or text during titling.
              The  feature code <i> must refer to an entry in the current FRT, and
              this command must not precede the FRT command. For  lines,  the  pen
              colour  and  the line-width only are taken from the FRT - any offset
              or pattern is ignored.

              TITLE LINE x y
              Draws a line from the 'current' position to (x, y). The  coordinates
              are  in  millimetres on the enlarged sheet. A feature code must have
              been specified using the TITLE FC LINE command (qv).

              TITLE MOVE x y
              Moves the 'current' position to (x, y) in  preparation  for  drawing
              lines  or  text.  The coordinates are in millimetres on the enlarged
              sheet.

              TITLE PROJECT plotsize
              States the projected plot data size in bytes of IFF  file.  This  is
              used by some versions of the program to report on plot progress.

              TITLE TEXT angle text
              Draws <text> (from the first non-spacing character to the end of the
              command  line)  at  angle <angle> (in degrees anticlockwise from the
              positive X axis), starting at the 'current' position. A feature code
              must  have  been  specified  using  the  TITLE FC TEXT command (qv).
              Certain items may be be included in the text using escape  sequences
              (% followed by a character). The available escape sequences are:

                 %C - the CPU time elapsed since plotting started
                 %D - the date
                 %E - the time elapsed since plotting started
                 %I - the string given in a TITLE DISPLAY command (Ident)
                 %R - the reduction factor (as specified by the ENLARGE command)
                 %T - the time
                 %x - include character x (where x is not one of the above)

              Note that after use of %C or %E, the timer will be  reset  when  the
              next  plot  is  started. To include the character % in the text, use
              the sequence %%.

      33.  TOLERANCE subcommand
           Sets various tolerances

              TOLERANCE CIRDRAW a b c
              Sets the point density for drawn circles (graphical types 2-5).  The
              arguments are exactly as for TOLERANCE CURDRAW (qv).

              The default setting is a=0, b=0.05, c=0,  which  gives  an  'arc  to
              chord'  distance  of  0.05mm.  This  corresponds to approximately 30
              points in a circle of 10mm radius, the number being proportional  to
              the square root of the radius.

              TOLERANCE CURDRAW a b c
              Sets the point density for drawn  curves  (graphical  type  6).  The
              three  coefficients  (a,b,c)  control  the  spacing  of interpolated
              points. The approximate separation of points (d) is given by:

                    d = a + 2*SQRT(2br) + cr      (r is radius of curvature)

              which means (if other coefficients were zero) that

              a  gives a constant separation of a mm
              b  gives a constant 'arc to chord' distance of b mm


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 18


              c  gives a constant angular deviation of c radians (2*PI/c points in
              a circle)

              Trailing arguments may be omitted (the setting is unchanged). If  no
              arguments are given, or all values are zero, then the default values
              are used.

              The default setting is a=0.25, b=c=0, which gives 4 points per mm.

              TOLERANCE JUSTIFY r
              Each character in a font is usually terminated by some blank  space,
              so  that  the  characters in strings of text are separated. When the
              length of a text string is required (e.g. for right  justification),
              this space must be subtracted from the last character.
              The TOLERANCE JUSTIFY command sets the amount to be subtracted  from
              a  text  string  to  represent this blank space. The argument is the
              proportion of the height of the text that is blank space. By default
              the value 0.333333 is used.

      34.  TRI filename
           Specifies the TRI (text representation IFF) file.

      35.  [+/-]WINDOW [xmin ymin xmax ymax]
           Select a region of the IFF file for plotting. The specified window will
           be  used  in  preference  to  the  RAnge  entry  in  the  IFF file when
           calculating the position of the plot. If +CLIP  is  used  in  addition,
           then  no  data  outside  the  window  will  be  plotted. Use -WINDOW or
           ENABLE/DISABLE ABSOLUTE to revert to using the RAnge  entry  (default).
           The  values  are  specified in the units contained within the IFF file,
           unless ENABLE ABSOLUTE has been given, in which case the values include
           any  origin offset contained within the file. An absolute window may be
           used to plot the correct region when several IFF files  with  different
           origin offsets are being plotted together.

      36.  WORKSTATION wtype [conid]
           Used to set the GKS workstation type and connection identifier in  some
           versions  of  FPP.  The  workstation  may  be  changed  during a run by
           re-issuing the WORKSTATION command. The values of wtype and conid which
           may  be  used  depend  on the particular GKS implementation in use. The
           WORKSTATION command may be used to  force  the  program  to  close  and
           re-open  the  workstation  (values  of  wtype or conid different to the
           present values must be given). This can be  useful  in  versions  which
           generate disk file output, since a new file will be created.

           FPPBEN,FPPCAL* (except 5800),FPPHCBS - wtype should  be  100  plus  the
                 following values:
                 1 if plotter is sheet based and pen should return to origin after
                   plot, otherwise roll based and pen should advance past plot.
                 2 if origin is at min x, max y, otherwise origin assumed to be at
                   min x, min y.

           FPPTEKARGS - wtype should be 4014 for raw TEK4014, 7000  for  ARGS,  or
                 9900 for MUART TEK4014.

           FPPUIS - wtype should be 7000 if 8 planes are  to  be  used,  otherwise
                 only 7 planes will be used.

           FPPVRSVGS,FPPBEN3000,FPPPI448 - if wtype is 1000, then  opaque  drawing
                 mode  will  be  selected  initially.  The same effect is achieved
                 using an ESCAPE 1 command.
           Other versions -  for  workstation  type  values  applicable  to  other
                 version  of  FPP, see the appropriate section of the FPP Plotters
                 User Guide, which is part of the Plotting Package manual.




  5.2  [3mObsolete[0m [3mcommands[0m

  The following commands are old synonyms  for  some  of  the  preferred  commands
  above. Most are retained for upwards compatibility.

       1.  [+/-]AKIMA [r]
           Permit  Akima  curve   interpolation   (+AKIMA)   or   suppress   curve
           interpolation   regardless   of  type  (-AKIMA).  If  interpolation  is
           suppressed then curve features are drawn  as  straight  lines.  A  real
           value  may be given to specify the number of points to be generated per
           mm on the enlarged plot. This is equivalent to TOLERANCE  CURDRAW  1/r.
           If no value is present, the tolerance is unchanged.
           AKIMA 0 is equivalent to -AKIMA.

  5.3  [3mSpecifying[0m [3mfilenames[0m

  Filenames need to be specified for the following files:-
                  [3mFile[0m                            [3mDefault[0m [3mFilename[0m

  1.      IFF (Internal Feature Format)           LSL$IF:IFF.IFF
  2.      FRT (Feature Representation Table)      LSL$FRT:FRT.FRT
  3.      SRI (Symbol Representation IFF file)    LSL$FRT:SRI.SRI
  4.      TRI (Text Representation IFF file)      LSL$FRT:TRI.TRI

  The IFF filename must be given. The FRT, SRI and TRI names need not be given, in
  which  case the above defaults are used. An exception to this is when the FRT is
  given, in which case the SRI and TRI will default to  the  FRT  name  (with  the
  appropriate postfix).

  eg. The command sequence:-
      FRT TEST
      IFF TESTFILE
  will result in the files TEST.FRT, TEST.SRI, TEST.TRI and TESTFILE.IFF
  being used.


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 21


  All the files defined must exist, even if the IFF file contains  no  symbols  or
  text.

  Filenames may be changed up until the point where plotting actually starts.



  5.4  [3mSelecting[0m

  The user can select the required data within  the  IFF  file  by  feature  code,
  feature serial number, layer, or ancillary code (AC) information.

  Feature codes are selected using the SELECT FC and DESELECT  FC  commands.  They
  can be specified explicitly (either singly or as ranges), or as group names (eg.
  'SEL 20, 30-35, WATER, 100, BROWN'). Separators may be spaces or commas.  Ranges
  are indicated by the '-' character.

  The group names have to be defined in the FRT file. Since the FRT file  required
  is  unknown  until the FRT command is given the legality of group names given is
  unknown. Consequently, SELECT and DESELECT commands are only checked for  syntax
  initially.  Once  a  FRT  command  has been given, and the FRT file successfully
  read, the stored-up SELECT FC and DESELECT FC commands are actually processed.

  Layers are selected by layer number using the SELECT LAYER  and  DESELECT  LAYER
  commands.  Ranges  of  layer numbers may be specified in the same way as feature
  code selection, but group names are not allowed.

  Features may be selected by feature serial  number  using  the  SELECT  FSN  and
  DESELECT  FSN commands. Ranges of feature serial numbers may be specified in the
  same way as feature code selection, but group names are not allowed.

  Features may be selected according to the presence or absence of  particular  AC
  (ancillary  code)  types  using  the  SELECT  AC  and  DESELECT  AC commands. In
  addition, particular values, or ranges of values in the AC may be selected.  The
  text part of an AC may be used for selections on the basis of its containing (or
  not containing) a particular text string, or its containing a particular  string
  followed by an integer value.

  Initially, and after a SELECT ALL command, if the first selection command for  a
  particular category (FSN, FC etc.) is a SELECT (not a DESELECT), then all values
  other than those explicitly selected will be deselected.

  Subsequently, any selections for a  given  category  are  just  added  to  those
  already present.

  In all cases, the SHOW SELECTIONS command will display the current state of  the
  selections.



  5.5  [3mScaling[0m

  There are 3 main mechanisms for specifying the scale:-

       1.  IFF Units and Sheet Scale (SCALE IFF/SHEET)


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 22


           This is expected to be the most commonly  used  scaling  mechanism.  It
           defines  the  scaling  necessary to convert from IFF units to mm on the
           final enlarged plot. The SCALE SHEET value  is  the  number  of  ground
           units  represented  by one sheet unit, while the SCALE IFF value is the
           number of ground mm represented by one IFF unit. SCALE IFF defaults  to
           1000 (IFF units are ground metres) if not given.

           IFF units may be either in terms of the paper map, or in terms  of  the
           ground.  In  the  former  case  the SCALE FACTOR command should be used
           instead.

           An example of using this mechanism (assuming a 1:25000 map):-

           [3mIFF[0m [3mUnits[0m              [3mSCALE[0m [3mSHEET[0m [3mValue[0m       [3mSCALE[0m [3mIFF[0m [3mValue[0m

           Metres on ground               25000                   1000

           The effective formula used on the coordinates is:-

                  mm (enlarged plot) = IFF units * (SCALE IFF / SCALE SHEET)

       2.  Explicit Scale (SCALE FACTOR).

           This scaling mechanism allows the user to combine the SCALE  SHEET  and
           SCALE IFF values into 1 explicit command (FACTOR = IFF / SHEET).

           It defines the scaling necessary to convert from IFF units to mm on the
           final  enlarged  plot.  This  mechanism  is most appropriate if the IFF
           units are directly related to the units on the sheet,  rather  than  on
           the ground.

       3.  Automatic Scaling (SCALE AUTO).

           This scales the plot automatically so that  it  uses  as  much  of  the
           available  film  area  as  possible  (without  distorting  the  plot of
           course). The shape and extent of the plot is deduced from the IFF range
           entry  or from the WINDOW command. Text and symbol features which cross
           the edges of the film area will be clipped.

           Texts, symbols and patterns will not be scaled.  They  keep  the  sizes
           specified  by  the  FRT file. This usually means that this mechanism is
           not satisfactory for maps containing texts and symbols.


  The default action is to take the SHEET scale from the IFF Map  Descriptor  (MD)
  entry.  If  this  is unset, or DISABLE DESCRIPTOR is used, then a scale from the
  IFF Map Header (MH) entry is used. If this is also unset, then SCALE FACTOR 1 is
  assumed.  MCE  and  Ordnance  Survey type map headers are supported. In order to
  return to the default behaviour after a SCALE SHEET command has been given, give
  a  SCALE  AUTO  or  SCALE  FACTOR  command, followed by an appropriate SCALE IFF
  command.

  The ENLARGE command is normally used where a smaller film intermediate  plot  is
  produced  to  be  photographically  enlarged  to final map size, and defines the
  scaling factor necessary to convert between mm on the intermediate plot  and  mm
  on  the  enlarged  map. An enlargement value of 4, for example, implies that the
  enlarged plot is 4 times the size of the film plot - the film plot will be drawn


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 23


  4  times  smaller  than  the other scaling commands indicate. ENLARGE is used in
  conjunction with the SCALE FACTOR or SCALE  IFF/SHEET  mechanisms.  The  default
  enlargememt factor is 1.

  Texts, symbols and  patterns  will  be  scaled  up  or  down  according  to  the
  enlargement value.

  Scaling commands can be changed up  until  the  point  where  plotting  actually
  starts. They can be changed between plots but not between layers.



  5.6  [3mPlot[0m [3mpositioning[0m

  The position of the plot within the drawing area is controlled by the  POSITION,
  CENTRE, OFFSET, ORIGIN, ROTATE, and WINDOW commands.

  The default action is to place the area defined by the RAnge entry  in  the  IFF
  file  in  the centre of the drawing area. ROTATE can be used to turn the plot by
  an arbitrary angle, possibly to take  better  advantage  of  the  shape  of  the
  drawing  medium.  If a different position is specified using -CENTRE or POSITION
  then the (possibly rotated) area is then placed in the position requested.
  Any OFFSET or ORIGIN commands then displace the plot from  this  position.  (The
  direction of the displacement is unaffected by ROTATE.)

  The WINDOW command may be used to override the values from the  RAnge  entry  in
  the  IFF  file,  and may be useful when plotting several files together to avoid
  problems associated with the different RAnge entries in the  files.  The  window
  values  may  be  specified  either  in  local  IFF  coordinates (default), or in
  absolute coordinates taking any origin offset into account (ENABLE ABSOLUTE).

  If +CLIP is used, then any data outside the RAnge, or WINDOW values, will not be
  plotted  at  all.  Note  that  data  can  only  be clipped to a rectangular area
  parallel to the sides of the drawing area, thus if a rotation  which  is  not  a
  multiple of 90 degrees is specified, some data outside the specified window will
  be drawn.

  If subsequent maps are plotted without giving any  new  scaling  or  positioning
  commands, then they will be positioned with regard to the local origin contained
  in the Map Descriptor or Map Header in  the  file,  thus  several  maps  may  be
  positioned correctly relative to each other.

  The commands causing the  origin  to  be  reset  (i.e.  the  next  map  will  be
  positioned  without  any  origin  shift,  and  its  local origin will be used in
  positioning any subsequent maps are:  OFFSET,  ORIGIN,  ENLARGE,  ADVANCE/CLEAR,
  ROTATE, CENTRE, POSITION, and any of the SCALE commands.



  5.7  [3mLabelling[0m

  All graphical types except text  may  be  labelled  with  their  feature  serial
  number, feature code, and various attributes from ancillary code (AC) entries.

  The LABEL command is used to select labelling (qv).


  FPP Reference Manual                                                     Page 24


  By default, labels are plotted at  the  first  coordinate  point  of  the  item,
  aligned using the first two points of the item. By default, the labels are drawn
  using font 1 from the TRI file at a size of 3mm, while the colour is taken  from
  the feature being labelled.

  The angle, colour, font, hardware option, offset, and size of labels may be  set
  explicitly  using  the  ANNOTATION ANGLE, COLOUR, FONT, HWTEXT, OFFSET, and SIZE
  commands respectively.

  Each LABEL command will set an additional attribute, and  all  these  attributes
  (if present) will be used to label each feature.

  eg       LABEL FSN
           LABEL FC
           LABEL AC Height

  will cause labels of the form "fsn fc [height]" to be attached to each  feature.
  The  height  will  only occur if the feature has a Height AC (type 3) associated
  with it.

  The LABEL NONE command should be used to cancel all labelling attributes.



  6  [3mError[0m [3mmessages[0m

  Error messages are written to the  terminal  output  stream  and  are  generally
  self-explanatory. There are 3 general categories of error message:-

       1.  Those concerning commands (direct commands or commands given  within  a
           command  file).  These  normally indicate that there is an error in the
           command syntax, or that the command has been given out of context.

       2.  Errors produced when reading the FRT file. These  indicate  an  illegal
           construct in an FRT entry.

       3.  Most errors will be those produced when reading the  IFF  file.  These,
           where  relevant,  are  followed  by a line indicating the layer number,
           feature serial number and  internal  sequence  number  of  the  feature
           causing the error.
           eg. 'Layer   100 - FSN   3142 - ISN   910'
