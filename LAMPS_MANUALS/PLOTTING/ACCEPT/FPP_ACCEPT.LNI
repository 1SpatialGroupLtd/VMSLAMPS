  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the FPP  fast  plotter
  program  which  is  the  major  component  of  the  Laser-Scan PLOTTING software
  package.  It assumes that the user is familiar  with  digital  cartography,  and
  with  operation  of  the  FPP  plotting  program  on DEC VAX computers.  See the
  "PLOTTING Software Product Specification (SPS)" for  a  precise  description  of
  FPP.  See the "FPP Reference Manual" for further information on FPP.

  The relevant data for the acceptance tests are listed  in  appendix  A  and  are
  supplied by Laser-Scan on installation of the system.

  The detail of the plot output being tested will obviously be  dependent  on  the
  installation and the particular plotter involved.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserve the right  to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.

  If not already set up as part of the LAMPS system installation, DCL symbols  and
  logical names should be set up by giving the DCL command:

                  @dcl_filename

  For the appropriate filename, see appendix A.

  This sets up the DCL symbol FPP as a  foreign  command  to  run  the  particular
  version  of  FPP  being  used at your site.  At sites with more than one type of
  plotter it will set up a series of DCL symbols eg.  FPPPS, FPPCAL5800.

  It will set up the following logical names if not already done:

       1.  LSL$IF:  - this points to the directory containing the acceptance  test
           IFF file

       2.  LSL$FRT: - this points to the directory containing the acceptance  test
           FRT, SRI and TRI files

  3.1  [1mInvoking[0m [1mFPP[0m

  Invoke the program by giving the appropriate DCL command.  At  most  sites  this
  will  be "FPP".  At sites with more than one type of plotter it may be necessary
  to qualify this command by type of plotter eg.  FPPBEN for Benson  pen  plotter.
  See appendix A for the command to use for these tests.

  Note that FPP prompts for input with:-

                  FPP>


                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Select a set of FRT, SRI, and TRI files by giving the command

                  FRT frt_filename

  and note the message indicating  successful  reading  of  the  FRT  file.   (For
  filename see appendix A).

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The scale of the plotted map depends on the required map  scale,  and  what  the
  coordinates in the IFF file represent (e.g. ground metres or sheet mm).

  Select the scale of the plotted map by giving the commands:-

                  SCALE SHEET sheet_scale
                  SCALE IFF   iff_scale

  and the enlargement required by giving the command:-

                  ENLARGE enlarge_scale

  The default action of FPP is to centre the plot in the drawing  area.   This  is
  usually  appropriate  for  a  film  plotter, but not necessarily on a roll paper
  plotter.  If required, set the plot position by giving the command:-

                  POSITION position_number

  (For values to be given to these commands, see appendix A).

  The required commands are given in appendix A.  Note the next prompt  indicating
  successful reading of the commands.

  and note the messages indicating successful reading of SRI and TRI files.   (For
  the iff_filename to be used, see appendix A).

  Note the message giving the scale and extent of the plot and the confirmation of
  occurrence of each layer.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Confirm that the map is plotted as expected by  examining  the  plot  for  size,
  content  (all  features  plotted),  and feature representation.  If using a film
  plotter, or any device where the output cannot be examined without removing  the
  medium,  then  defer  checking  the plot until the acceptance test is completed.
  Note the the final section of the plot may not be output until the  FPP  program
  exits.
