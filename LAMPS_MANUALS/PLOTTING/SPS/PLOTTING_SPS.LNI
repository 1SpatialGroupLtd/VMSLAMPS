  This document describes the Laser-Scan LAMPS software  package  PLOTTING.   This
  package  provides  output  to hardcopy plotting devices.  The main components of
  the package are as follows:

       1.  The Fast Plotter Program (FPP).

       2.  Hardcopy graphics drivers for specific devices (GKSxxxSHR).

       3.  Utility programs, such as the PSEXPORT PostScript convertor.

  Details of these are given below.

  2.1  [3m[1mFPP[0m [3m[1mDescription[0m

  FPP is a plotting program for graphical data held in  Laser-Scan  IFF  (Internal
  Feature  Format)  files.   It runs on DEC VAX and Alpha AXP series computers and
  will drive a variety of graphics peripherals via its internal ISO  standard  GKS
  interface.   These  include the Laser-Scan Laserplot film plotter, the Lasertrak
  combined  digitiser/display/plotter,  and  a  number  of  pen  plotters,   photo
  plotters,  electrostatic  plotters,  inkjet  and  laser  plotters,  and graphics
  screens.

  The graphical output can also be sent to a 'primitive' IFF file, containing only
  lines  (with a thickness) and solid fill areas.  The primitive files can then be
  processed with the PLOTTING package module PRIM2RASTER to produce raster  output
  in various formats (currently HELL MDP, and HELL TDP).

  The basic element of graphical data is the feature.  Each feature has a  feature
  code  as  its  primary attribute.  Feature codes are in the range 0 to 32767 and
  are used to identify different kinds of features;  examples  in  a  cartographic
  application  are  pavement,  house,  parish boundary, spot height.  Each feature
  code implies a certain graphical  representation.   The  correspondence  between
  feature codes and the representation is made by looking up the feature code in a
  Feature Representation Table (FRT) to  determine  the  graphical  type,  colour,
  size, symbology etc.  (see the FRT User Guide, and the FRTLIB Reference Manual.)

  FPP supports 12 graphical types which are implied  by  the  feature  code.   The
  graphical  types catered for, and their relationship with the various attributes
  are:-

  2.3  [3m[1mFPP[0m [3m[1mFacilities[0m

  The following facilities are  included  in  the  basic  FPP  software.   Further
  details can be found in the FPP Reference Manual, but the presence or absence of
  a facility in such a manual does not imply any commitment by LSL.

        *  Accept Laser-Scan's internal feature format (IFF) data  as  input  from
           disk (refer to the IFF User's Guide for details).

        *  Load   feature   representation   information   from    FRT    (Feature
           Representation  Table)  files.   Load symbol and text shape information
           from SRI (Symbol Representation IFF) and TRI (Text Representation  IFF)
           files.   See the Software Product Specification for the MAPPING package
           for more details.

        *  Apply a specified scale and offset to the data, and/or rotate the data.

        *  Select data to be plotted from the IFF file  on  the  basis  of  layer,
           feature code, feature serial number, and ancillary codes.

        *  Plot features with graphical attributes  obtained  by  looking  up  the
           feature  code in a user-specified Feature Representation Table (see the
           FRT User Guide).  The graphical attributes can be defined easily by the
           user to meet a particular map specification.

        *  Provide multiple prioritised representations of features, allowing full
           cartographic  representation of features, and also support for features
           passing `under' or `over' others.

        *  Clip plot data to a rectangular orthogonal window.

        *  Interpolate curve features using either Akima or McConalogue methods.

        *  Label features with feature serial number, feature code, or attributes.

        *  Selectively colour contour data according to height.

        *  Provide online help when using the program interactively.

        *  For PostScript output devices,  FPP  can  use  standard  Adobe  Type  1
           PostScript fonts to give character shape.  If available, it can use AFM
           (Adobe Font  Metric)  files  to  give  character  spacing  information,
           including pair kerning.




  3  [3m[1mGKS[0m [3m[1mDRIVERS[0m

  Hardcopy graphics drivers for specific devices are supplied as a shared  library
  for  each  type of plotter supported.  These are called GKSxxxSHR.EXE, where xxx
  is the device type e.g.  LP for Laserplot).

  Certain of these may also be used by programs such LITES2 for hardcopy plotting.
  Currently  only  PostScript, CalComp 5800, HPGL2, and Versatek drivers have been
  certified for use with LITES2.

  See the PLOTTING Workstation Guide chapter for the  appropriate  plotter  for  a
  full description of capabilities and restrictions.



  4  [3m[1mPSEXPORT[0m

  A utility program called PSEXPORT is provided, which  converts  PostScript  data
  produced  by  FPP  or  LITES2  via  the  PLOTTING PostScript driver, into a form
  suitable for import into other systems.  The two formats supported are:

        *  Adobe Illustrator 88 format (AI88).  This is used by DTP  systems  such
           as  Adobe  Illustrator  or  Aldus Freehand.  The format produced is the
           AI88 subset described in the Adobe Illustrator Document  Format  manual
           of May 1991.

        *  Encapsulated PostScript (EPS).  This is used by word processing systems
           as  a  description of a figure for inclusion in a document.  The format
           produced is version 3, as described in the  Appendix  H  of  the  Adobe
           PostScript Language Reference Manual Second Edition 1990.

  OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2, or  OpenVMS  AXP  version  1.5  (or  higher  version,
  assuming  continued  upwards  compatibility  by  DEC)  concurrently  with  other
  interactive and batch processes.

  DEC windowing software is required  for  the  VAXstation  displays,  either  VAX

  The "VMS DECwindows Developers Kit for Motif" is not adequate.

  Laser-Scan's LITES2 interactive digitising and editing software running  on  the

  VTRAK automated digitising is recommended for volume input of documents.

  The MAPPING package, and the IMP Map processing  utility  package  are  software
  prerequisites for LITES2, VTRAK, PLOTTING, and any other LAMPS software.

  It is recommended that the reader becomes familiar with  the  LAMPS  Environment
