  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The main component of the LITES2  package  is  the  LITES2  cartographic  editor
  program.   LITES2  is  an interactive graphic and geographic display and editing
  program and as such forms a basic component of Laser-Scan's  LAMPS  mapping  and
  GIS  systems.   It  has  been designed to be particularly suitable for work with
  cartographic (map) type data which normally comprises lines, areas, symbols  and
  text but it can also be used on other types of data made up of similar features.
  It is possible also to display and edit raster images, either as a  backdrop  to
  the vector data, or alone.

  Other components of the package are the UILMENUS and  UISMENUS  programs,  which
  allow  the  user  to  create  and  customise hierarchical screen menu systems on
  windowed display screens.  These are primarily intended for use with the  LITES2
  program, but may be used for other purposes.

  The LITES2 package runs on DEC VAX and Alpha AXP series computers and will drive
  a variety of graphics peripherals via its internal ISO standard GKS interface.

  Input vector map data is taken from Laser-Scan  IFF  files.   These  are  binary
  files  holding  feature, coordinate, and attribute information in a compact form
  for efficient access.  Coordinates are held in 32 bits (64 bits/coordinate pair)
  with  at  least  7  significant  decimal  digits.  The magnitude of a coordinate
  cannot be smaller than O.29x10E-38 nor greater than 1.7x10E+38.  There are least
  40  million  addressable  values  for  each coordinate.  Each file has an origin
  offset held as double  precision  (64-bit)  values,  and  associated  projection
  information, allowing accurate coverage over the whole world.

  The basic element of graphical data operated  on  is  the  feature.   The  areal
  extent  of  features can be defined by the user; it can comprise the most simple
  of units - a link between two junctions - or it can extend  to  more  complexity
  such  as a whole building complex.  Features can be grouped together into layers
  which are typically used to separate background from  foreground,  or  data  for
  different  colour  separations.  Edit operations can therefore be carried out on
  features, parts of features or groups of features.

  Each feature is uniquely identified by  a  feature  serial  number,  and  has  a
  feature  code as its primary attribute.  It may also have an arbitrary number of
  other numeric (integer, or real), date, time, character,  or  textual  Ancillary
  Codes  (ACs).   The coordinate points within the feature, may also have optional
  attributes.



  2  [3m[1mFEATURE[0m [3m[1mATTRIBUTES[0m

  Numeric feature codes are in the range 0 to  32767  and  are  used  to  identify
  different  kinds  of  features;  examples  in a cartographic application include
  pavement, house, parish boundary, spot height.   Each  feature  code  implies  a
  certain  graphical representation.  The correspondence between feature codes and
  feature representation is made by looking up  the  feature  code  in  a  Feature
  Representation  Table  (FRT)  to  determine  the  graphical  type, colour, size,
  symbology etc (see the FRT User's Guide and the FRTLIB Reference Manual for  the
  design of feature coding schemes described above).


  LITES2 Package Software Product Specification                             Page 3


  Facilities are available for definition of arbitrary  groups  of  feature  codes
  each  with  a  unique  name  to  allow easy selection of subsets of the data for
  display, editing or output.  For example, all types  of  roads  may  be  classed
  together in a group called "Roads" so that a given operation can be performed on
  all roads even though different types such as motorways, A-class roads etc.  may
  be coded differently.

  Features may have an arbitrary number of other numeric (integer, or real), date,
  time,  character, or textual Ancillary Codes (ACs).  These are commonly used for
  such items as "date of last edit", or "pipe diameter", or "feature height".  The
  content,  format,  and description of ACs is defined in the FRT using a flexible
  "Ancillary Code Definition" (ACD) mechanism.

  As well as X and Y  coordinates,  features  may  have  a  number  of  additional
  per-point  attributes  (up to 18 per point at present).  These are defined using
  the ACD mechanism as for the  per-feature  ACs.   These  attributes  may  be  of
  numeric (integer, or real), date, time, or character data types.

  The validity of certain editing operations is dependent on the graphical type of
  the feature which is being operated on (line, symbol, text etc).

  The editor supports 12 graphical types which are implied by  the  feature  code.
  The  graphical  types  catered  for  and  their  relationship  with  the various
  attributes are:-

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       | symbol/   | Line   |       |        |        |        |

  The following facilities are included in the LITES2 software.  Certain of  these
  are  licensed  as  options,  and  these  are  marked below as [OPTION].  Further
  details of facilities can be found in the LITES2  USERS  GUIDE  and  the  LITES2
  REFERENCE  MANUAL.   The  facilities  described  below  are subject to continual
  development and are likely to change at short notice.



           4.1  [3m[1mData[0m [3m[1mFormat[0m


        *  Accept Laser-Scan's internal feature format (IFF) data  as  input  from
           disk (refer to the IFF User's Guide for details).

        *  Output edited IFF  data  to  disk.   (Note  software  is  available  to
           transfer other commonly used data formats to and from IFF).

        *  Load and display multiple maps from  separate  IFF  files  (up  to  100
           files).   LITES2 has support for `continuous mapping' where the area of
           interest is divided horizontally  into  `tiles',  and  vertically  into
           `strata',  allowing  automatic  loading  of  relevant datasets around a
           required point.

        *  Display and edit data in a different projection from that in which  the
           data  is  stored  in  the IFF data.  A projection can be chosen for the
           LITES2 display space and multiple files in  perhaps  several  different
           projections,   or   even   in  geographical  (latitude  and  longitude)
           coordinates, can all be displayed together on the selected projection.

           See the Software Product Specification for the IMP package for  details
           of the supported projections.

        *  Load   feature   representation   information   from    FRT    (Feature
           Representation  Table)  files.   Load symbol and text shape information
           from SRI (Symbol Representation IFF) and TRI (Text Representation  IFF)
           files.   See the Software Product Specification for the MAPPING package
           for more details.

        *  [OPTION] Accept Laser-Scan's raster formats (DTI, LSI or LSR)  data  as
           input  from  disk for display (refer to the SPS for MATRIX or LSRRASTER
           packages for details).  This can be be  a  scanned  raster  graphic,  a
           remotely  sensed  (satellite)  image,  or  a generated model, such as a
           terrain altitude, slope, aspect, or intervisibility model.

        *  [OPTION] Allow LITES2 to operate in a "3  dimensional  mode"  where  it
           treats  Z as a third coordinate rather than as an attribute of a point.
           In this mode Z values are interpolated and generated in the same way as
           X   and   Y   values.    Principally   for   use  in  conjunction  with
           photogrammetric input devices.

        *  Allow LITES2 to access attributes  of  features  held  in  an  external
           relational  database.   The  fundamental  facilities  to  do  this  are
           provided by LITES2 when used  in  combination  with  Laser-Scan's  XGIS
           toolkit.  See the product specifications for the HORIZON and METROPOLIS
           GIS products for more information.

        *  Read English-like LITES2 commands from one or more keyboards,  allowing
           command abbreviation.

        *  Use of a user-defined  command  menu  which  may  be  attached  to  the
           digitising  table,  a  separate menu table, or displayed on the screen,
           for input of commonly used commands (provided menu hardware available).

        *  Use of choice devices such as mouse buttons or  function  buttons,  for
           input  of  commonly used commands, where appropriate supported hardware
           available.

        *  Read commands from  command  files,  with  facilities  for  interaction
           between command file sequences.

        *  Accept commands from multiple auxiliary input  streams,  which  may  be
           serial  line  devices  such as terminals, voice recognition systems, or
           may be from other processes via virtual mailbox devices.  A common  use
           of  the  mailbox  facility  is  to  accept  commands from a menu-driven
           graphic user interface  such  as  the  UISMENUS  or  UILMENUS  programs
           provided with the LITES2 package.

        *  Define and execute "Macro" commands.  Macros are created as a series of
           commonly  used  basic  commands  which can be grouped together under an
           arbitrary name.  The sequence of commands  can  then  be  performed  by
           simply  calling  the  macro  name;  very  complex  editing tasks can be
           achieved easily in this way.

        *  Allow conditional execution of macros,  depending  on  the  results  of
           tests.

        *  Allow passing of parameters or `arguments' to macros.

        *  Provide  statement  labels  and  jump  commands  to   allow   iterative
           execution.

        *  Provide lexical functions to  carry  out  string  operations,  such  as
           padding, trimming, substring extraction.

        *  Allow definition and  manipulation  of  integer,  real,  and  character
           variables,  complete  with  operators  and functions, to make the macro
           language into a complete, easy to use programming language.

        *  Allow examination of many  "system  variables"  containing  information
           about  the  LITES2  command  environment  and about attributes of found
           features.

        *  Use of a Feature Code menu to select primary attributes of features  to
           be constructed or modified (provided menu hardware available).

        *  Provide reading and writing of ASCII files using LITES2 commands.

        *  A locking mechanism that prevents simultaneous editing of the same  IFF
           file by more than one operator.

        *  Display features with graphical attributes obtained by looking  up  the
           feature  code  in  a  user-specified Feature Representation Table.  The
           graphical attributes can be defined easily by the user to meet any  map
           specification,  including  multiple  prioritised representations, which
           allows full  cartographic  representation,  and  support  for  features
           passing `under' or `over' others.

        *  Magnify sections of the map onto the screen  for  clarity  or  accuracy
           reasons.   Editing  can  continue  on the magnified section and further
           magnifications may be made upon this section itself, up to the  natural
           limits  of  the display.  Panning and zooming can be achieved easily in
           this way.

        *  Draw refresh pictures on the screen  to  clarify  the  current  editing
           operation.

        *  Allow labelling of whole features or  the  individual  data  points  of
           features  with  their attributes.  On suitable hardware, the background
           for these labels can be "blanked out" in a user specified colour.  This
           can  be  used  to increase readability by deleting the background or to
           highlight the text.

        *  On suitable hardware, allow the bit planes of the display to be divided
           into independent overlays.

        *  On suitable hardware, allow additional windows on the screen into which
           graphics and text can be drawn with LITES2 commands.

        *  [OPTION]  Allow  the  display  of  "Raster  Image"  backdrop   pictures
           (assuming  suitable  graphics hardware available), in Laser-Scan's DTI,
           LSI, or LSR formats.  This can  be  be  a  scanned  raster  graphic,  a
           remotely  sensed  (satellite)  image,  or  a generated model, such as a
           terrain altitude, slope, aspect, or intervisibility model.  The  vector
           foreground picture can be distorted to fit if necessary.

           Legends to explain the meaning of the  colours  used  in  these  raster
           images can be generated automatically.

        *  [OPTION] Allow  the  display  of  stored  "Raster  Image"  pictures  as
           associated  images  in  ancillary  display  windows  (assuming suitable
           graphics hardware available).  Links can be made to such picture  files
           from attributes of features in the main map display, allowing a user to
           point to a feature and cause a picture to be shown  of  the  geographic
           object.

        *  [OPTION] Allow the generation of perspective views from raster  images,
           with  map data overlaid, and their display in ancillary display windows
           (assuming suitable graphics hardware available).

        *  [OPTION] Allow the  production  of  hardcopy  plots  on  a  variety  of
           supported  plotting  devices  (assuming  suitable  hardware available).
           This option is only available  with  the  version  of  LITES2  for  the
           DECwindows/Motif  windowing system.  For full functionality in plotting
           of combined raster and vector data, a colour electrostatic  plotter  is

           needed.   See  the  PLOTTING  package  for more information on hardcopy
           options.  Further  support  for  hardcopy  plotting  using  the  LITES2
           facilities  is  provided by Laser-Scan's XGIS toolkit.  See the product
           specifications for the HORIZON and METROPOLIS  GIS  products  for  more
           information.

        *  [OPTION] If plotting to PostScript  hardcopy  is  available,  then  the
           output  can  be  processed  to  produce  files suitable for import into
           DeskTop Publishing (DTP) systems such as Adobe  Illustrator.   See  the
           SPS for PLOTTING for more details.

        *  Position cursor accurately on existing features, or at the intersection
           of existing features.

        *  Create new features.

        *  Allow map graphics to be set up  on  the  digitising  table,  to  allow
           accurate   digitising   of  new  features  (provided  digitising  table
           available).

        *  Allow stream digitising from digitising table and other selected  input
           devices.

        *  [OPTION] Allow digitising of 3 dimensional data from a  photogrammetric
           plotter (at present KERN DSR)

        *  Find and identify existing features within the map  data  for  editing.
           Find  operations  are fast because sectoring information is built up as
           the map file is read in, and then kept in memory.

        *  Delete features.

        *  Recover features deleted in error.

        *  Copy existing features.

        *  Shift (reposition or drag) existing features.

        *  Remove/insert/replace sections of line features.

        *  Split a line feature into two or three parts.

        *  Extend the ends of line features.

        *  Form closed loops.

        *  Join two line features of the same feature code, optionally merging the
           features.

        *  Join multiple line features of the same feature code together into  one
           feature.

        *  Examine and change certain basic attributes of  features,  for  example
           feature code, feature serial number or layer.

        *  Add, examine, change or delete further attributes of features  held  as
           Ancillary Codes (ACs).  Ancillary Codes provide facilities for multiple
           coding of single features with numeric (integer, or real), date,  time,
           character, or textual attributes.

        *  Use of constraining facilities when constructing lines.  Lines  may  be
           forced  to be horizontal, vertical, parallel, perpendicular, radial (to
           circle arcs) or be constrained to lie on existing line features.  It is
           also possible to provide explicit coordinates or lengths.

        *  Generate new line features offset from existing ones.

        *  Force open and closed line string features to be square.

        *  Call a user written routine, optionally passing it  a  single  feature.
           The  routine may interrogate and/or modify the feature and pass it back
           to LITES2.  The routine may also return a LITES2 command to be obeyed.

        *  Create invisible lines.  e.g. for gaps  in  contours,  or  doorways  in
           buildings.

        *  Generate  line  features  as  circles,   arcs   or   regular   polygons
           automatically.

        *  Interpolate curved sections during construction.  This facility  allows
           the  interpolated points to be inserted in the feature rather than just
           being generated for display.
           Curves may use either Akima's or McConalogue's interpolation method.

        *  Filter existing features to remove extra points, or to add more  points
           by curve interpolation.

        *  Apply a two-point transform to features to relocate,  orient,  magnify,
           reduce, or stretch them.

        *  Add,  examine,  change  or  delete  additional   per-point   attributes
           containing numeric (integer, or real), date, time, or character data.

        *  Allow coordinates to be specified in latitude and longitude,  when  the
           map data itself is in a well defined projection.

        *  [OPTION] Automated edge-match across a nominated line using either  the
           JOIN  or  TIE  commands,  creating  a  guidance  command  file to allow
           interactive completion in cases where automatic matching failed due  to
           e.g.  missing  element  or  mismatched  feature  codes.   Features in a
           read-only map are treated  as  correct  -  any  editable  features  are
           matched on to them.

        *  Edit words in text features, by substituting a new string for  part  of
           the existing one, adding text or replacing the text entirely.

        *  Text can be positioned with its supplied locating point in any of  nine
           positions around the text string.

        *  Rotate text and symbol features.

        *  Align text and symbol features  with  another  feature.   The  size  of
           scaled symbols can also be determined by this operation.

        *  On suitable hardware, the background for texts can be "blanked out"  in
           a  user  specified colour.  This can be used to increase readability by
           deleting the background or to highlight the text.

        *  [OPTION] Allow the definition and manipulation  of  "composite  texts",
           which  contain  multiple  text  entities  with possibly different size,
           colour, font, position and angle attributes.  This allows  handling  of
           paragraphed text and curved text.

           version   of   LITES2   for  DECwindows/Motif  displays,  and  only  if
           workstation  provides  Display  PostScript  (DPS)  support).    Support
           includes  reading  of  AFM  (Adobe Font Metrics) files for pair kerning
           information, to give cartographic quality texts.  Composite  characters
           are also supported through definitions in the AFM file.

  OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2, or  OpenVMS  AXP  Version  1.5  (or  higher  version,
  assuming  continued  upwards  compatibility  by  DEC)  concurrently  with  other
  interactive and batch processes.

  DEC windowing software is required for the VAXstation  or  DECstation  displays,
  either  VAX  Workstation  Software  layered  product  (VWS)  or DECwindows Motif
  layered product (the latter is required for X-terminals).  The  "VMS  DECwindows
  Developers Kit for Motif" is not adequate.

  The MAPPING package is a LITES2 software prerequisite.  As part of this  package
  Laser-Scan  provide the necessary interface libraries for data files (IFF files)
  and data representation information (FRT files).

  The MATRIX package is a LITES2 software prerequisite if the Raster Image  option
  is  required.  This provides interface libraries and utilities to manipulate the
  image files.

  The LSRRASTER package is a LITES2 software  prerequisite  if  the  Raster  Image
  option is required and LSR files are to be manipulated.  This provides interface
  libraries to manipulate the image files.

  The PLOTTING package is a LITES2 software prerequisite if the hardcopy  plotting
  option is required.

  LITES2 would normally be used in conjunction with the IMP map processing package
  and  the  FPP  plotting  program  which forms the main component of the PLOTTING
  package.

  Laser-Scan's VTRAK automated digitising package is recommended for volume  input
  of documents.
