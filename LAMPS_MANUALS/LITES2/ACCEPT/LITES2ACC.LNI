  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan  LITES2
  cartographic  editor.   It  assumes  that  the  user  is  familiar  with digital
  Cartography, and with operation of the LITES2 editor on DEC VAX computers.   See
  the  "LITES2  Software Product Specification (SPS)" for a precise description of
  LITES2.  See the "LITES2 User Guide", and  the  "LITES2  Reference  Manual"  for
  further information on LITES2.

  References to drawing on hardware devices, and input from digitiser  tables  are
  dependent on the workstation configuration at the particular customer site.

  The relevant data files for the acceptance tests are listed in  Appendix  A  and
  are supplied by Laser-Scan on installation of the system.

  Any customer specific features of LITES2 to be tested are listed in Appendix  B.
  These tests should be performed at the appropriate time as described.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserve the right  to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.

  2.1  [1mEnvironment[0m

  Set up logical name LSL$LITES2INI to point to the file of LITES2  initialisation
  commands   provided   for   acceptance   testing.   This  file  is  supplied  as
  "LSL$LITES2CMD:filename.LCM".  (For filename see appendix A)

  Set up logical name LSL$IF:  to point to the directory containing the acceptance
  test IFF file filename.IFF.  (For filename see appendix A)



  2.2  [1mInvoking[0m [1mthe[0m [1meditor[0m

  Invoke the editor by giving the DCL command  "LITES2".   Note  that  the  editor
  loads and announce itself as :-
  LITES2 ([version]) V[n] of [hh:mm:ss dd-mmm-yy]",
  where [version] is the name of the hardware specific version of LITES2 in  user,
  [n]  is  the  version  number,  and [hh:mm:ss dd-mmm-yy] is the time and date of
  linking of this release.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Note the messages showing opening of initialisation command file (as set up with
  logical  name LSL$LITES2INI above), and completion of reading it.  Other command
  file(s) may be automatically read at this  point  depending  on  the  particular
  hardware configuration.

  Select a set of FRT, SRI, and TRI files by giving the command "FRT filename" and
  note  the  message indicating reading of the FRT file.  The return to the LITES2

  Ensure that graphics output is selected for  the  screen(s)  by  giving  command
  "ENABLE  GRAPHICS",  "ENABLE  PRIMARY",  or  "ENABLE  SECONDARY"  (depending  on
  hardware configuration)

  Select an IFF file to be edited by giving command "IFF filename", and  note  the
  messages  indicating  successful  reading  of  IFF,  SRI,  and  TRI files.  (For

  Before the map is drawn, you may be prompted to setup any or all of a menu,  map
  graphic  and  tracking  area  on  the  digitising table (if available).  Use the

  As the read-in  progresses,  note  that  the  map  is  drawn  correctly  on  the
  screen(s),  checking  it  against  the supplied map graphic checkplot.  The fine
  detail will be subject to the limitations of the graphics screen resolution.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  When read-in is finished, note that drawing is complete on  the  screen(s),  and
  that  the  message  about  "Input  complete" is given.  A second message "Now in
  READY state" may also follow.  Alternatively the program prompt  may  change  to
  "READY>".   This  and  other  similar minor differences depend on the particular
  installation configuration options chosen.
