  1  [3mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the extra facilities  available  under  licence  in  the
  versions  of  LITES2  for  DEC  VAXstation  displays  (images  LITES2UIS.EXE and
  LITES2MOTIF.EXE), when  used  in  conjunction  with  a  KERN  DSR  or  LEICA  SD
  photogrammetric  plotter.   It  is  to  be  read  as  a supplement to the LITES2
  Reference Manual, the LITES2 VAXstation  (UIS)  Workstation  Guide,  the  LITES2
  X-Windows (MOTIF) Workstation Guide, and the LITES2 User's Guide.

  In order to use a KERN  DSR  or  a  LEICA  SD  with  LITES2,  the  logical  name
  LSL$LITES2_KERN_ROUTINES  must  be  set  up to point to an appropriate shareable
  image (supplied by Laser-Scan).  The name of this image  will  depend  on  which
  instrument  is  to  be  used,  and  whether it is fitted with the optional image
  superimposition system.

  Before use of LITES2, the instrument must be switched on  and  loaded  with  the
  model intended for use.  The DSR also required its plate processor program (e.g.
  KPH$DSR1B:PROC2.SAV) to be loaded.  It is expected that this will be done  using
  KERN  or  LEICA  software.  The default directory must be set to that containing
  the orientation files for the model -  those  files  relevant  to  LITES2  being
  ABSOR.DAT,  ABSOR.MEA, INNER.MEA, and RELATI.MEA.  For a KERN DSR, certain other
  files must also  be  present  in  their  appropriate  directories  -  these  are
  KPH$WS:KERNIO.DAT,   and  (if  a  KRISS  is  being  used)  KPH$WS:KRISS.DEF  and
  KPH$MAPS200:KRISS.LO.

  The IFF file(s) being used should have a coordinate range  appropriate  for  the
  model loaded into the instrument.  The instrument works in absolute coordinates,
  so the origin offset in the IFF file(s) should be set appropriately.

  The instrument is activated using the command ENABLE SD.  GRAPHICS must also  be
  enabled.   This  command  will  cause  the  instrument to be initialised and the
  floating mark driven to the current LITES2 cursor position.  If given in INITIAL
  state, then the instrument will be initialised when the map(s) are read in.  The
  instrument may be enabled/disabled at any time.  A VAXstation display window may
  optionally be used (ENABLE PRIMARY).

  While the instrument is enabled, the floating mark will be  continuously  driven
  to  the  LITES2  cursor  position.  If the LITES2 cursor does not have a known Z
  coordinate, then the floating mark will be driven  to  the  X  and  Y  position,
  retaining its existing Z coordinate.  The instrument will not move if the LITES2
  cursor position is outside its range of movement.  It is  advisable  to  disable
  the  instrument  if performing a sequence of non-interactive edits, so as not to
  waste time driving the instrument to the LITES2 cursor position.   The  floating
  mark  is  not  automatically  constrained  if  a  LITES2 cursor constraint is in
  operation - a button  which  transmits  a  position  must  be  pressed  for  the
  constraint to be applied.

  On the KERN DSR, pressing the pedals, the  outer  two  buttons  on  the  tracing
  stand, or the buttons on the keypad will transmit the coordinate of the floating


  LITES2 - KERN DSR and LEICA SD Workstation Guide                          Page 3


  mark to LITES2, though the PRIORITY POSITION command may be used to modify  this
  behaviour.   The buttons may be programmed as a PUCK on device 6 with 20 buttons
  - the first 16 on the keypad, and the other 4 for press and release of left  and
  right pedals/tracing stand buttons.

  The layout of the buttons is as follows:

         Keypad
   -------------------
  |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 |
  |-------------------|          left pedal/button   press 17
  |  5 |  6 |  7 | 12 |                            release 18
  |-------------------|
  |  2 |  3 |  4 | 13 |         right pedal/button   press 19
  |-------------------|                            release 20
  |  1 | 16 | 15 | 14 |
   -------------------


  On the LEICA SD, pressing the pedals, the outer top two and lower right  buttons
  on  the tracing stand, the outer buttons on the trackerball, or some of the keys
  on the PC keyboard will transmit the coordinate of the floating mark to  LITES2,
  though  the PRIORITY POSITION command may be used to modify this behaviour.  The
  buttons and keys may be programmed as a PUCK on device 6 with 256 buttons -  the
  first 6 for press and release of the three pedals/tracing stand buttons, and the
  rest for the keys on the PC keyboard (possibly  modified  by  holding  down  the
  SHIFT, ALT, or CTRL keys while pressing the key).

  The layout of the buttons is as follows:
                       
                      top left pedal/button   press  4
                                            release  3
                       
                     top right pedal/button   press  2
                                            release  1

                   lower right pedal/button   press  6
                                            release  5
                       

  To use PC keys for LITES2 macros, either the P1 + P2, or P2 only option must  be
  selected  in  the LEICA menu on the PC screen.  Some of the keys are always used
  to operate the LEICA menu on the PC screen and cannot be used for LITES2 macros.
  The  correspondence  of  PC  keys  with  macro  numbers  is  best  determined by
  experiment (do ENABLE ECHO, press  them,  and  observe  which  macro  number  is
  echoed).  For keys which have an associated ASCII code, the macro number is just
  the ASCII code (e.g. 'A' is 65, 'a' is 97, 'CTRL/D' is 4 the  same  as  pressing
  the  top left button).  The other keys, and the ALT/key combinations usually use
  numbers 128 and above.



  4  [3mUse[0m [3mof[0m [3msuperimposition[0m

  The superimposition display is activated using the command ENABLE SI.   GRAPHICS
  and  SD  must  also  be  enabled.   This  command will cause the superimposition
  display to be initialised.  If given in INITIAL state, then the display will  be


  LITES2 - KERN DSR and LEICA SD Workstation Guide                          Page 4


  initialised  when  the map(s) are read in, and the map(s) will be drawn onto it.
  The picture  will  only  appear  after  the  read  in  is  complete.   Once  the
  superimposition    display   has   been   initialised,   then   any   subsequent
  ENABLE/DISABLE/TOGGLE SI commands will just switch the display on and off.  Note
  that  any  editing performed while the display is disabled will not be reflected
  in the picture until a redraw is performed.  The KRISS is a  monochrome  device.
  The  COLORISS  has 7 colours plus black.  For any operations which use a colour,
  the colour displayed will be the remainder after dividing the colour  number  by
  8,  except  that 0 is black, and anything else divisible by 8 uses 7.  It may be
  possible to change the actual colours of colour numbers 1-7 using directives  in
  the DAT_SI.CFG file on the PC.



  4.1  [3mManual[0m [3mregistration[0m

  On the KERN DSR with KRISS superimposition, if it is necessary for any reason to
  manually  bring  the  KRISS  image  into  registration with the plates, then the
  ENABLE KRISS REGISTRATION command may be used.  The user is prompted to move the
  plates  until  registration  is  acheived,  and  then  press the right button to
  accept, or the left button to leave the registration unchanged.  Once  set,  the
  registration  will  be maintained for the duration of the LITES2 session.  If it
  is required to remove the effect of any manual registration, the command  ENABLE
  KRISS REGISTRATION 0 may be used.

  This command does nothing on the LEICA SD with COLORISS - a similar alignment of
  the picture is performed instead using the PC menu and keyboard.



  4.2  [3mRedrawing[0m

  Any commands causing the LITES2 picture a  be  redrawn  (DRAW,WINDOW,ZOOM)  will
  clear  the  superimposition display and reload the picture into it.  Since it is
  loaded with the entire picture initially, this is not in general useful,  unless
  selections have changed, or it is desired to just load part of the picture.  The
  superimposition display may be disabled during a redraw if it is desired just to
  redraw the picture on the VAXstation screen.



  4.3  [3mHighlighting[0m

  Found features, new constructions etc.  are highlighted on  the  superimposition
  by  flashing  them.  The display is limited to flashing up to 40 data points, so
  it is advisable to use a command such as REFRESH VERTICES  5  (for  example)  to
  limit  the  number of points that LITES2 will attempt to highlight.  Rubber band
  lines are not drawn on the display because they  would  be  distracting  to  the
  operator viewing the floating mark.



  4.4  [3mScreen[0m [3mmenu[0m

  A screen menu may be displayed on the superimposition display.  In the  case  of
  the  KRISS,  it  must  be  fitted  with an additional overlay plane, and for the
  COLORISS, the 'menu' directive must appear in the DAT_SI.CFG  file  on  the  PC.


  LITES2 - KERN DSR and LEICA SD Workstation Guide                          Page 5


  The  menu  is  created  exactly  as  on the VAXstation.  For the purposes of the
  arguments to DESCRIBE SCREENMENU specifying the size of the menu, the display is
  assumed  to  have  30 pixels to the cm (the entire screen is 1024 pixels).  If a
  VAXstation is also in use, the same menu will be drawn on  its  screen.   It  is
  possible to get a different size or shape of menu on the two screens by giving a
  new DESCRIBE SCREENMENU command, then  DISABLE  SI,  redrawing  the  menu  using
  DISABLE/ENABLE SCREENMENU, and finally ENABLE SI again.

  The superimposition menu is activated by giving an additional ENABLE  SCREENMENU
  command  when the menu is already visible.  This will cause a full screen cursor
  to appear on the KRISS, or an arror pointer on the COLORISS, which may be  moved
  using  the  tracing  stand, hand wheels, or mouse/trackerball on the instrument.
  After moving to the desired menu box, pressing any button will trigger the  menu
  command and remove the cursor.  If one of the pedals or tracing stand buttons is
  programmed to give the ENABLE SCREENMENU command, then the pedal or  button  may
  be  held  down while the cursor is moved, and the release be used to trigger the
  selection.  If the cursor is outside the screen menu, or a command is given from
  another  device,  then  the  cursor  will  disappear and no menu command will be
  obeyed.



  4.5  [3mStatus[0m [3mline[0m [3mand[0m [3mdialogue[0m [3marea[0m

  A status line  similar  to  that  on  the  terminal  may  be  displayed  on  the
  superimposition  display.   It  contains the current state, and the construction
  map, layer, feature code, and text feature code.  The command ENABLE  SI  STATUS
  is  used  to  display  the  status line.  This command has optional arguments to
  specify the position and size of the  status  area  (see  the  LITES2  help  and
  reference manual).

  In addition, a single line dialogue area is provided into which  other  messages
  may  be  written  using the ENABLE SI MESSAGE command.  The position and size of
  the dialogue area is set using the ENABLE SI DIALOG command.

  The text written into the screen menu, status line, and dialogue area  uses  the
  TRI  font  specified  by the ANNOTATION FONT command (default 1).  The height of
  the text is equal to the height of the area (or 0.8 of the height of a menu  box
  for the menu).  The status line and dialogue area are cleared before new text is
  written into them.  An additional half of the height  below  the  area  is  also
  cleared,  in  order  to erase any descenders from the letters, so care should be
  taken when positioning the menu and the areas so that they do not interfere with
  each other.

  By default, the superimposition overlay plane  (including  screen  menu,  status
  line,  and  dialogue  area)  is  displayed  in  the  left eyepiece.  With stereo
  superimposition, the ENABLE SI SIDE command may be used to switch to  the  right
  eyepiece (or both).  This command may also be used to temporarily switch off the
  overlay plane, without losing its contents.



  4.6  [3mGeneral[0m

  The image visible in  the  instrument  may  be  zoomed  locally  using  its  own
  controls.   Because  of this, LITES2 does not know the size of the picture being
  viewed, so some experimentation with TOLERANCE FIND and ANNOTATION SIZE  may  be


  LITES2 - KERN DSR and LEICA SD Workstation Guide                          Page 6


  required to find appropriate values.  The screen menu, status line, and dialogue
  area may not be visible as a result of zooming, so it is recommended that macros
  be  written  to  change their size and position appropriately for different zoom
  factors.
