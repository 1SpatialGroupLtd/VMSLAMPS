  1  [3mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the workstation dependent facilities  available  in  the
  version  of LITES2 for TEK_ARGS type displays (image LITES2TEK_ARGS.EXE).  It is
  to be read as a supplement to the LITES2 Reference Manual and the LITES2  User's
  Guide.



  2  [3mDisplay[0m

  This version of the LITES2 program drives two displays.

       1.  The PRIMARY workstation is usually a Tektronix 4014 or 4016  DVST  with
           enhanced graphics, controlled by a LSL MUART microprocessor for refresh
           generation.
           To  use  this   MUART   the   Laser-Scan   WOSP   workstation   control
           microprocessor program must previously have been loaded.

           This MUART multiplexes the Tektronix display with one or more of:

            *  DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal

            *  Optional Summagraphics BITPAD 1 with 4-button cursor.

            *  Optional ALTEK DATATAB digitising table with 16 button cursor

           onto a single serial line.

                                            NOTE

                   If the user is logged on to the terminal on  the  MUART
                   serial  line,  it will not be possible to use the SPAWN
                   command from LITES2, unless in INITIAL state.  This  is
                   a  restriction  caused  by  the manner in which DEC VMS
                   handles unsolicited terminal input.


           The primary display is made available by the ENABLE GRAPHICS and ENABLE
           PRIMARY  commands.   The  table  and  bitpad  on the serial line can be
           accessed by the ENABLE BITPAD and ENABLE TABLE commands.
           The primary display is accessed on logical name LSL$TK.  If this is not
           the  user's  login  terminal, then the line's protection must be set to
           allow access to it.

           The command WORKSTATION TYPE 1 4014 allows the use of a Tektronix  4014
           display  (or  an emulator) without a LSL MUART, as the primary display.
           In this case there is no possibility of multiplexing any other  devices
           on  the  serial  line,  and any interactive devices must be on separate
           serial lines.  More significantly, there is no support  in  LITES2  for
           refresh  on  4014  displays without a MUART.  Subsequently this mode of
           operation is intended for a "quick look" at IFF files rather than as  a
           serious editing station.

       2.  The SECONDARY workstation is a Sigmex Args 7000 colour  raster  display
           with  8  bit  planes.  Laser-Scan supply the VMS driver for this device
           (except on a MicroVAX, for which a DEC driver is used).


  LITES2 - TEK_ARGS Workstation Guide                                       Page 3


           When using the Sigmex display it is possible to use the Sigmex  tracker
           ball to control the LITES2 cursor.

           The secondary display is made available  by  the  ENABLE  GRAPHICS  and
           ENABLE SECONDARY commands.  The tracker ball is made available with the
           ENABLE BALL command.
           The display is accessed on logical name LSL$VS.  This will be  assigned
           to  e.g.   IDA0:  (or XAA0:  on a MicroVAX).  Note that LSL$VS is not a
           serial line; the keyboard and the alphanumeric planes of the  ARGS  are
           on separate serial line.


  LITES2 (LITES2TEK_ARGS) can be run on a variety of combinations of hardware;  in
  particular, it is not necessary for both workstations to be present.
  For example to run on an ARGS display alone give the commands:

          ENABLE GRAPHICS
          DISABLE PRIMARY
          ENABLE SECONDARY

  followed by commands to set up the interactive input devices.

  It is possible, but not advisable to log  in  on  the  Tektronix  keyboard,  but
  normally  a  second terminal or (less satisfactorily) the ARGS keyboard is used,
  in order to avoid having alphanumerics and graphics on the same screen.

  As neither of the displays have local memory, all drawing is done from the  host
  computer.   If  the  first  operation after read in is to zoom or window into an
  area smaller than the whole map, time may be saved during read in by suppressing
  the primary and/or secondary displays.

        *  PRIMARY
           On the primary display the MUART controls the LITES2  cursor,  and  all
           highlighting  of  found features etc.. This is achieved by drawing part
           of the feature in "write through" mode.  As the display  is  a  storage
           tube,  it  is  not  possible  to  delete features individually and when
           features are deleted they can be "scrubbed" by drawing over them with a
           zig-zag line.  This feature can be disabled (DISABLE SCRUB) if desired.
           Only features capable of being RECOVERed are scrubbed.
           The cursor may be small or large, blinking  or  steady  (DISABLE/ENABLE
           BIG and ENABLE/DISABLE BLINK).

           If the primary display is not using the MUART, then there is no refresh
           capability, so the alpha cursor (usually a square block) is used as the
           LITES2 cursor.

        *  SECONDARY
           On the secondary display there are 16 colours available (0 - 15,  where
           0  is  the  background  colour  and  1  -  15  are foreground colours).
           Features drawn in these foreground colours  are  refreshed  by  drawing
           into  the  refresh  plane in their corresponding refresh colour.  These
           refresh colours are numbered 16 - 31, and are generally arranged to  be
           the  same  colour  as  the  foreground,  but drawn flashing with black.
           Transient parts of the refresh picture (i.e.  rubber  band  lines)  are
           drawn in colour 32, and other parts are drawn in colour 16.
           The colours used for the picture are  defined  using  a  text  file  on
           logical name LSL$IDSY02.  See Appendix for the format and an example of

           Colours may  be  changed  subsequently  using  the  WORKSTATION  COLOUR
           command  which  sets  the  colour  which  will be used for a particular
           colour index.  This command has the format:-

                    WORKSTATION COLOUR  index red green blue

           eg       WORKSTATION COLOUR 1 0.0 0.5 0.7

           Colour index 0 is the background colour, while 1 up to a maximum of  15
           are  foreground  colours.   When  these  are  changed the corresponding
           refresh colour is also set to its flashing equivalent.  The red, green,
           and  blue  values  should  be  in  the range 0.0 to 1.0 and control the
           fraction of the  primary  colours  in  the  mixture.   Negative  colour
           indices  may  be used to set the colour of (eg) highlighted features in
           certain implementations.
           Colour index -1 sets the colour used for the transient parts of refresh
           Colour index -2 sets the colour used for other  parts  of  the  refresh
           picture (e.g. the current construction)

           The cursor on the secondary display is fixed as a  full  screen  cross;
           neither ENABLE BLINK nor DISABLE BIG have any effect on this display.

           Display overlays (created  by  the  WORKSTATION  OVERLAY  command)  are
           supported  on  the  ARGS  display.   4  planes are available for use as
           overlays, though provision to use up to all 8 planes may be provided at
           some stage.




  3  [3mHardware[0m [3mdependant[0m [3mcommands[0m

  Display overlays (OVERLAY command) are currently supported in  this  version  of
  LITES2 on the ARGS (secondary) display as is raster backdrop (IMAGE command).

  Neither multiple  displays  (DISPLAY  command)  nor  perspective  viewing  (VIEW
  command) are supported in this version of LITES2.

  The only FOLLOW subcommand that is available is FOLLOW TABLE, and then only when
  the table is connected by a seperate serial line (see below).



  4  [3mInteractive[0m [3mdevices[0m

  In addition to the  login  keyboard,  this  version  of  LITES2  is  capable  of
  interpreting  commands  from  the  Tektronix  keyboard (if this is different), a
  digitising table, a bitpad attached to the MUART, and a tracker ball attached to
  the Sigma Args.



  4.1  [3mDigitising[0m [3mTable[0m

  If MONITOR is enabled, in addition to TABLE, then the digitising table input  is


  LITES2 - TEK_ARGS Workstation Guide                                       Page 5


  interpreted  either  using  the  Table  Monitor  system, or by reading the table
  directly.  The former allows the table to be set in stream mode,  giving  smooth
  cursor  tracking.   If  MONITOR  is  not  enabled,  then  it is assumed that the
  digitising table is connected via a Laser-Scan MUART controller.

  To use the Table Monitor, a table monitor process must be started, using program
  STARTMON.    If   the   'named  monitor'  option  is  used,  then  logical  name
  LSL$MONITOR_TABLE must point to the serial line.  In addition, if the  table  is
  anything  other than a standard ALTEK, then logical table LSL$TABMON_ROUTINE (or
  LSL$TABMON_ROUTINE_<terminal> for  named  monitor)  must  point  to  a  suitable
  decoding  shareable  image.   This  logical  name must be available to the table
  monitor process, and so should be in the group or system logical name table.  If
  stream  mode is used, to allow smooth tracking using the lowest numbered button,
  then the lowest acceptable stream rate above 4 points per second should be used.
  If  set  too  high,  then  the table monitor will use large quantities of system
  resources, if too low, then buttons other than the 'tracking button' will repeat
  if held down.

  If logical name LSL$MONITOR_TABLE is set up, but LITES2 determines that no table
  monitor  process  exists,  the  table  will be accessed directly.  This does not
  allow stream mode or smooth tracking.



  4.2  [3mBitpad[0m

  If a MUART bitpad is available, then the command  ENABLE  BITPAD  may  be  used.
  When the bitpad is used the cursor may be moved around by moving the bitpad puck
  while button 1 is held down.  The other buttons on the puck  may  be  programmed
  using a PUCK command.  The bitpad is device 2.

  If a menu is used on the bitpad, then attention should be drawn to the  PRIORITY
  PUCK command.  The lowest numbered button is always used for cursor tracking, so
  for the 4 button puck, 2 other buttons may be given priority so that their  puck
  function  is obeyed even if they are pressed over the menu.  At least one button
  must not be given priority, otherwise it will be impossible to access the menu.



  4.3  [3mTracker[0m [3mball[0m [3mand[0m [3mbuttons[0m

  If the secondary workstation has been enabled, and there  is  a  SIGMEX  tracker
  ball  and  function  button  box  available, then the command ENABLE BALL may be
  used; this allows the user to move  the  cursor  about  the  picture  using  the
  tracker  ball,  and  to input commands from the function buttons.  Note that the
  function buttons must first have been defined as a PUCK on device 4.

                                        NOTE

          Unlike other ENABLE commands that set  up  interactive  devices,
          ENABLE  BALL  can  be given at any stage of the editing process;
          not only in INITIAL STATE.

  If the WORKSTATION TYPE 1 4014 command has been given, then TEKTRONIX GIN  input
  can be initialised using the ENABLE BITPAD command.
  To use the GIN input, hit the "return" key, with no input;  the  GIN  cursor  (a
  full  screen  cursor)  will  appear,  and  this  can  be  moved  about using the
  appropriate tracking device.  When the appropriate GIN trigger is  pressed,  the
  GIN cursor will disappear, and the LITES2 cursor will move to its position.

  In this case it is not possible to program the input device buttons, nor to  set
  up a menu on a bitpad (if that is the method of GIN input)
