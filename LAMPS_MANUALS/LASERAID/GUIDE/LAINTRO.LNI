       This introductory guide is designed to train new operators  the  method  of
  digitising  map data with the Laser-Scan Lasertrak semi-automatic digitiser.  It
  assumes the user to be a novice  operator  with  some  cartographic  skills  and
  explains  basic  system operation in step-by-step procedures.  Most descriptions
  are limited to those essential for basic system operation.  A  full  description
  of  Lasertrak  features  and  commands  can  be found in the "Laseraid Reference
  Manual".



  2  [3mINTRODUCTION[0m

       The Laser-Scan Lasertrak is a semi-automated line-following  digitiser  for
  the  mass  conversion  of  line  drawings  into  digital  form.  It performs the
  conversion under the guidance of an operator who directs the system to each line
  for digitising and who intervenes with appropriate feature coding and assistance
  when required.   Actual  line  digitising  is  performed  automatically  and  is
  achieved with minimum operator intervention in most cases.

       The Lasertrak system is based on the  same  hardware  configuration  as  is
  being  used in Laser-Scan's High Resolution Display device (HRD-1).  Readers are
  referred to the HRD technical manuals for details of the hardware  configuration
  and software interface.

       The source documents for digitising on Lasertrak are film  negatives  which
  are  photographic reductions of the original source drawings.  The film negative
  is of standard A6 microfiche  size  (148mm  x  105mm).   This  source  image  is
  inserted  into  the optics unit of the Lasertrak on the film negative holder and
  thence the image for digitising is back-projected on to the large format display
  screen  for  interpretation by the operator.  Though all scanning is carried out
  on the fiche-size  negatives,  the  operator  can  observe  all  digitising  and
  software decisions on the enlarged projection of the display screen.

       The digital data generated by the Lasertrak  are  placed  directly  into  a
  linear  (vector)  form  as  though  they had originated from a manual digitising
  table.  All digital lines (including curves) are represented  as  straight  line
  segments between two digitised coordinates.  Clearly, lines of extreme curvature
  have considerably more coordinates than straight lines:  two end-points are used
  to demarcate and fix the latter case.

       The system of coordinates that is generated by the Lasertrak is selected by
  the  operator  during  the machine set-up stage.  The target coordinates of four
  known control points are provided to the system  which  then  ensures  that  all
  subsequent digitising is performed in relation to the same coordinate space.

       The representation of line features is also defined by the operator who  is
  able  to  direct the laser cursor along appropriate routes during digitising and
  determine the feature start and end locations, its attribute code and so on.

       The name given to the  controlling  software  which  drives  the  Lasertrak
  during  digitising  is  LASERAID.  This is the program which runs on the Digital
  VAX and MicroVax series of computers  and  which  converse  with  the  Lasertrak
  hardware  to  produce  the  automatic line-following capabilities of the system.
  This manual  describes  the  nature  of  the  Laseraid  program  and  the  basic
  facilities it provides for the operator during digitising.  There are three main


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                           Page 5


  methods of line following that can be  used  with  Laseraid  and  these  include
  normal  line-following  (both solid, continuous lines or dashed lines), extended
  line-following with junction recognition capability and  finally  edge-following
  mode to digitise, for example, the outer periphery of colour mask sources.

       The five diagrams which follow show the components of the Lasertrak system.
  Diagram  A  shows  the  whole of Lasertrak with pointers to the locations of key
  control panels which operators should be aware of.  These panels are  referenced
  by  the  letters B-E, which corresponds to the titles used for the four close-up
  diagrams which follow diagram A.

       A summary of the five component diagrams is given below.


        A - The Lasertrak system components and control panels
        B - Main control panel
        C - Engineer's panel
        D - Operator's panel
        E - Optics unit and film carrier



       A convention has been used in this document so that each control switch  on
  each  panel  is  labelled uniquely.  This reference system is used throughout in
  the text descriptions which follow.  Thus, the reference ([1mC[0m23) used  within  the
  text  refers  to  diagram  C, control switch number 23 - in this case, it is the
  photo-chromic clamp switch.

       To digitise a map accurately the source document must be on a stable  based
  transparent  or translucent film.  Source documents on paper are equally able to
  be digitised but operators should be aware of accuracy limitations.

       Before photographing, it must be decided to what reduction factor the  film
  negative  will  be  made  for  the map; this depends on the size of the map, the
  widths of the line-work, the strength in density of the lines and the complexity
  of  the  detail on the map.  The Lasertrak projects the source negative at a 10X
  enlargement on the photochromic screen, so if  photographed  at  less  than  10X
  reduction  factor  the  map will be larger on screen than the original.  This is
  recommended to aid the Lasertrak operator  and  also  as  a  starting  point  on
  deciding the reduction factor necessary.



  4.2  [3mConsiderations[0m [3mOf[0m [3mLine[0m [3mQuality[0m

       The ideal line for Lasertrak is one which is crisp and black with  a  clear
  background.   However, within certain limitations, the Lasertrak can also handle
  lower quality source data and operators will quickly  appreciate  by  experience
  its capabilities.

       The diagram below may help:  it gives some example enlargements of  a  line
  showing various possible densities


















  4.3  [3mLinewidth[0m [3mSpecifications[0m

       The minimum linewidth required for digitising is 0.03mm (0.0012 in.) on the
  reduced  negative,  the  maximum  is  0.3mm (0.012 in), and the optimum is about
  0.04mm on the source negative.

       The film negative should be 105mm wide, 148mm long.  The digitising area is


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 13


  placed centrally as shown in the diagram below.
















       The  exposure  should  have  an  optical  density  of  approximately   0D1.
  Laser-Scan recommends Kodak ON4 film.

       The digitising region on the map must be reduced to fit  the  area  on  the
  negatives  as  shown above.  Some examples follow which show the size of the map
  and the reduction factor necessary.

       If the map is too big to be reduced within x10 reduction factor  or  if  it
  can  not  meet  the  linewidth  requirement, then it needs to be photographed in
  sections so that more than one film negative is produced  for  each  map.   This
  also  applies  if  the  map  is  too complex and needs a low reduction factor to
  define the lines clearly on the negative.  If there is a gap between  two  lines
  to be digitised of at least 0.4mm on the screen then it will be possible for the
  machine to follow all lines.  Some examples below show some  typical  Laser-Scan
  experiences.

  4.5.1  [3mControl[0m [3mPoints[0m -

       Each full map (or each sub-division if it is necessary to digitise a map in
  portions)  must  have  four  clear control points.  These must have at least the
  same line qualities as the lines which comprise the map data.  It  is  sometimes
  an advantage to draw the control points outside the edge of the data to help the
  Lasertrak to locate them but is not crucial.
















       There follows some examples which, show the required  location  of  control
  points for maps which are to be digitised in portions.


















  4.5.2  [3mPhotography[0m [3mReference[0m [3mMarks[0m -

       It is an advantage to always mark on the map an upward pointing arrow prior
  to  photography.   Clearly this should not obscure data to be digitised and aids
  operators in ensuring correct film  orientation  when  it  is  placed  into  the
  Lasertrak.   In  general, the arrow should always be made to point so that it is
  aligned along the shortest map axis to enable the effective use of  the  maximum
  reduction factor possible.

       Also marked on the map should be a reference name and a small opaque  block

       Always, when photographing a new batch of negatives, a square grid is  also
  photographed  to  enable  Lasertrak calibration for this batch.  The grid should
  have a pitch of 2cm or 4cm squares (1 or 2 inches).  The grid should  also  have
  an  arrow  and  an  opaque  block  as  previously  explained  in pre-photography
  enhancements  (section  4.5.2).   Use  of  this  calibration  grid  negative  is
  essential  and  details  of machine calibration are given in section 9.5.  It is
  also essential that the calibration grid is photographed  in  exactly  the  same
  position  and orientation as the map data photography.  It is futile to take map
  data photography in one orientation and take a  photograph  of  the  calibration
  grid  in  a  totally  different  orientation;  this  results  in  total  loss of
  registration when measuring the distortions inherent in the camera lens.

       First of all position the map on the photographic bed  so  that  the  North
  arrow  is  pointing  upwards  and the map text is forward reading.  Flip the map
  over so that the text becomes reverse reading and  then  rotate  it  through  90
  degrees  so  that the upward arrow in now pointing to the right.  Notice that in
  both the start position and the final position the lower left control remains as
  the same negative control point.

       The quickest way to achieve correct orientation is to move the bottom right
  hand corner of the map to the top left.  This procedure is copied for the grids.
  N.B.  It is recommended to position the digitising area of the map as  centrally
  as possible.

       We have now reached the  stage  where  we  have  marked  up  the  maps  and
  positioned  them  onto  the  photographic bed.  The camera should then itself be
  moved to the required settings to give  the  reduction  factor  which  has  been
  decided.   It  is  [3mCRUCIAL[0m  that  the  camera  is  [3mNOT[0m  moved  again  until  the
  photographic session (or batch) is complete.  The photographic exposures of each
  map in the batch and the standard grid can now be made.

       Laser-Scan always takes at least three different exposures of each map  and
  grid  thereby giving the Lasertrak operator a choice of exposures from which the
  best can be selected.  Before doing a large batch it is  a  good  idea  to  take
  several  test  exposures  first  to  try  to  determine the best setting for the
  Lasertrak.  Once the best exposure has been decided the full batch can be made.

       Use side and back lighting on the camera for the best results.

       We do not recommend using paper maps for accuracy reasons, though  in  some
  cases  it  can  not  be  avoided.   The only difference in using paper is in the
  positioning on the photographic bed:  all other procedures should  be  following
  exactly as before.

       When positioning paper on the photographic bed rotate the  map  through  90
  degrees without turning it over e.g.
















       The grid should be positioned exactly the same as was used  for  the  paper
  described above.  Only use side lights on the camera for paper maps.

       The instructions which follow explain the procedures necessary to  start-up
  the  Lasertrak  hardware;  they assume that the system is currently switched off
  with no power being supplied to either the  projection  system  or  the  lasers.
  Confirmation  that  the system is in this off state is provided by the following
  symptoms:


  Main control panel([1mA[0m5):

      (a)  Master power-lock key in off, vertical position ([1mB[0m9)

      (b)  Green confirmation on/off light extinguished ([1mB[0m10)

      (c)  Orange photochromic display  ([1mA[0m2)  extinguished:   note  other  machine
           states can produce similar symptoms - see details on diazo plotting and
           main shutter switch under section 5.1.

      (d)  Water cooling unit and water supply should also be switched off.


       The procedure to power-up Lasertrak from cold involves following  a  series
  of steps in sequence as are described below.

      (a)  Switch on water supply for the laser cooling system

      (b)  Turn clockwise to horizontal the master  power-lock  key  on  Lasertrak
           main panel ([1mB[0m9)

      (c)  Depress green master on/off button to power-up  machine:   confirmation
           is given by green illumination of this button ([1mB[0m10).

      (d)  Confirm that machine status is on-line by adjusting  the  'M/C  STATUS'
           switch to its on-line position ([1mB[0m11).


       The Lasertrak is now in a powered-up state confirmed by the illumination of
  the   green   power-on   light   ([1mB[0m10).   Under  normal  circumstances,  further
  confirmation of this switched-on state will be  the  appearance  of  the  orange
  colour to the photochromic display screen; this will start to appear after about
  thirty seconds and will reach full brightness within five minutes.

       Lasertrak digitises its line work from 105mm source negatives  as  produced
  at the photography stage (see section 4).  These documents should be placed with
  correct orientation into the negative carrier ([1mE[0m32) for insertion to the  optics
  unit  of  the  Lasertrak.  The negative loading procedure is described in detail
  below.



      (a)  Check that the correct negative is available and select that  with  the
           best contrast of dark and light if several negatives are available.

      (b)  Set the photo-chromic clamp switch on Lasertrak's  engineers  panel  to
           open (PC clamp switch to upward position) ([1mC[0m23).

      (c)  Open the door of the optics unit by  rotating  the  key  anti-clockwise
           (clockwise on Fastraks) and pulling open the door ([1mA[0m3).

      (d)  Unclamp the negative carrier by moving the zone plate clamp to the left
           (E34).

      (e)  Withdraw the negative carrier from the optics unit by  sliding  it  out
           through   the  door.   ENSURE  THAT  THE  CARRIER  DOES  NOT  FOUL  THE
           PHOTOCHROMIC  FILM  DURING  THIS  OPERATION.   Careful  withdrawal  can
           obviate this problem.

      (f)  Remove existing negative from the holder if present.

      (g)  Check that the film holder is clean  and  free  from  dust  and  greasy
           finger prints.

      (h)  Hold the new source negative so that it is the  correct  way  up  (with
           text  reading  correctly).  Rotate it so that the negative is still the
           correct way up but with the text  reversed.   Laser-Scan  suggest  that
           user's  include  an arrow pointing upwards on all Lasertrak photography
           to provide easy reference of negative orientation (see Section 4.5.2).

      (i)  Place the negative on to the negative carrier and  slip  it  under  the
           spring  loaded  edges.   Take  care  not  to  mark the glass with dirty
           fingers.


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 20


      (j)  Replace the negative carrier complete with negative in the optics unit,
           ensuring  that  the  glass  side of the carrier is pointing towards the
           rear of the Lasertrak (i.e.  towards the orange  projection  bulb)  and
           the negative side is positioned adjacent to the photochromic film.

      (k)  Re-engage the zone plate clamp by sliding the lever  to  the  right  to
           fasten the negative carrier in place.  ([1mE[0m32).

      (l)  Close the door of the optics unit and lock it  by  pushing  firmly  and
           rotating the key clockwise (anti-clockwise on Fastraks) ([1mA[0m3).

      (m)  Re-position the photochromic clamp switch on  the  engineers  panel  to
           closed (PC clamp switch to downward position) ([1mC[0m23).


       The negative is now in position and operators can begin to invoke  software
  procedures  necessary  to  digitise  linework  from  it.  Note that the negative
  should be projected clearly on to the Lasertrak display screen with all  control
  points  and  drawing  extremes  visible.  If the image is not completely visible
  then readjust the position of the negative in the  carrier  until  the  complete
  image can be seen on the display screen.

       The Lasertrak system connects to  a  standard  Digital  Equipment  VAX  and
  MicroVax series of computers running a version of the standard VMS (or MicroVMS)
  operating system.  Before any digitising session can commence, the operator must
  first  log on to the VMS system at the Lasertrak close-up terminal.  Readers are
  referred to the collection of manuals on VMS produced by Digital  Equipment  for
  the detailed command structure and facilities.

       Basic login is achieved by prompting the  attention  of  the  computer  and
  supplying  a  valid  user's  code  and password.  Prompting the attention of the
  computer  is  achieved  by  hitting  the  <return>  key  slowly  several  times.
  Successful connection is confirmed by the command.


                                     USERNAME:

       The operator replies with a valid user  code  (hitting  return  to  signify
  completion of typing).  On the command


                                     PASSWORD:


  the operator types in the valid security code (which is  not  displayed  on  the
  screen) and successful completion will be confirmed with a report of the version
  of VMS currently installed and the VMS prompt symbol:


                                         $

       The dollar symbol '$' is the standard VMS prompt and signifies to the  user
  that the computer is at DCL command level (This can be considered the stage when
  the operating system can accept commands in the Digital Control  Language  known
  as  'DCL').   At  this  stage,  any  legal DCL command or appropriate Laser-Scan
  command can be entered as required.

  7.2.1  [3mBasic[0m [3mUse[0m -

       A basic  digitising  session  on  Lasertrak  first  involves  the  operator
  directing  VMS  to  the appropriate file directory into which will be placed the
  digitised vector coordinates.  All files of digitising have by default the  file
  extension  '.IFF'  to  their names.  IFF stands for Internal Feature File and is
  Laser-Scan file structure  generated  by  the  Lasertrak  and  other  Laser-Scan
  mapping  systems.  Specifying the appropriate target directory in which to place
  the IFF file is achieved with the Laser-Scan command SI ('set  IFF  directory').
  This command is given in response to the VMS ($) prompt and may take the form


                                 SI file directory
                          e.g. SI DRA2:[BUREAU.COASTLINE]


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 22


       The command is not mandatory but is advisable for effective  file  handling
  on  VMS.  Failure to include the 'SI' command prior to digitising will result in
  the IFF files being generated in a default directory with logical name LSL$IF:.

       Users should also  note  a  complementary  Laser-Scan  command  'SD'  which
  directs  VMS  to  the  user's default directory on which can be run standard VMS
  commands.  Typical use of the command may take the form


                                 SD file directory
                          e.g. SD DRA2:[BUREAU.COASTLINE].

       Before users can invoke the Lasertrak  digitising  software,  it  is  first
  necessary  to initialise the scanning hardware.  This is achieved by issuing two
  Laser-Scan commands in reponse to the VMS prompt.  The first command  takes  the
  form:


                     [1mSETHRD[0m  (which can be abbreviated to SETH)


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 23


       This initialises the large screen display and re-sets various parameters in
  the  system.  Note that this command will also return the device to photochromic
  mode if  it  is  currently  in  diazo  mode.   Confirmation  of  the  successful
  completion  of  this  operation  is  achieved  with the appearance of the orange
  display screen and all function  buttons  extinguished.   Operators  should  not
  confuse  or  mistype  SETHRD  (abbreviated  to  SETH) as 'SET H' since this is a
  standard VMS/DCL command 'SET HOST' which performs  rather  different  functions
  not  discussed  here.   Note  also  that the SETHRD command (even in its correct
  form) is unable to complete successfully if the Lasertrak  is  off-line  to  the
  computer.   In  such  an event, the following warning message will persist until
  the device is switched on-line.


       'FASTRAK OFF-LINE - PLEASE SWITCH ON-LINE'

       The Lasertrak is switched on-line by raising (or rotating) the 'M/C STATUS'
  switch ([1mB[0m11) on the main control panel to the on-line position from the downward
  off-line position.

       The second initialising command for Lasertrak digitising takes the form:


                                      [1mCOL[0m [1mRED[0m

       This invokes the red laser for refresh mode in Lasertrak.  Failure  to  use
  'COL  RED'  may  result  in an inappropriate initialisation of the Lasertrak for
  digitising.  The default option (i.e.  no use of 'COL RED') is to use  the  blue
  refresh laser rather than red.  Generally it is advisable to use the red refresh
  laser while digitising.  Both the SETHRD and COL RED commands are  mandatory  at
  least  once  during a digitising session, although often a standard command file
  is provided to do this when the user logs in.

       Laseraid is the name of the controlling  software  used  by  the  Lasertrak
  hardware for digitising.  Its operation requires the following information to be
  available before the session commences:



      (a)  Is the session starting a new map or is it adding to a  file  that  has
           already started on a previous session?

      (b)  What is the name of the file into which  the  digitised  line  work  is
           going to be placed?

      (c)  What is the name of the Lasertrak parameter file for this job  and  has

       The command string necessary to invoke Laseraid is given in response to the
  VMS prompt.  It consists of the Laseraid startup command and two parameters; all
  of which are mandatory with options to include  additional  keywords  for  other
  facilities.   The  command and two parameters (plus optional keywords) are typed
  on a single line and terminated by carriage return:  they are separated  by  one

                          -   Specifies that digitising has already been started
                              in a previous session and the current session will
                              be adding to the work created previously.



  Parameter 2:
                is the file name into which the digitised output from Lasertrak is


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 25


                to be placed.  It must follow parameter 2 above.  The file name is
                given either with or without a three character VMS file extension.
                File  names  given  without  an  extension are assumed to have the
                suffix '.IFF'.  File names given with an extension  preserve  this
                extension in the output file name.


                     e.g.     FRED                 producing FRED.IFF
                              BERT.IFF             producing BERT.IFF
                              TONY.DIG             producing TONY.DIG


                If the keyword 'OLD' was supplied for parameter 1, it is essential
                that  the  file  name  given  in parameter 2 already exists in the
                current IFF target directory.


  NON MANDATORY COMMANDS:


  Parameter filename specifier

                By default, Laseraid will call up LNK.LAJ as  the  parameter  file
                which  Laseraid  will use to control its performance in digitising
                for the current map.  The parameter  file  (sometimes  called  the
                'patch'  file)  will  often  change according to the nature of the
                digitising production to be  undertaken.   Therefore  a  different
                'patch' file may need to be assigned.  Basic operators need not be
                totally conversant with the parameter file and merely need to know
                its name and status of calibration for the current batch of source
                photography.


                The names of parameter files follow normal VMS conventions .  File
                extension  comprises  of  up to three characters and is by default
                .LAJ .  It is recommended that the default  naming  convention  is
                adhered  to for easy reference, although it is possible to specify
                alternative naming conventions.


                Note that all parameter files for Laseraid  are  expected  by  the
                software to be found in the directory with the logical name:

                                             LSL$LK:


                In order to specify a  'patch'  file  in  the  command  line,  the
                following keyword must be entered before the patch filename.

  Contour elevation specifier


  [1mHTD   HTI[0m


                The commands 'HTD' or 'HTI'  (optionally  followed  by  a  numeric
                argument)  may  be  specified  to instruct Laseraid of the desired
                method of coding for heighting  (or  elevation)  data  in  contour
                digitising.   The mnemonic 'HTI' forces coding to be restricted to
                integer coding only and the codes  placed  in  IFF  as  a  type  2
                Ancillary  Code  (for  integer  contours).   Typical  examples  of
                integer coding includes 3003, -36, 27, 295.

                     The mnemonic 'HTD' forces coding to use  the  decimal  option
                for  the  coding  of  elevations; these will be placed in IFF as a
                type 3 Ancillary Code (for real contours).  Users are referred  to
                the  descriptions  of  the IFF structure which is given in the IFF
                user's guide.  Particular reference should  be  made  to  IFF  ACs
                (ancillary coding).

                     The optional numeric  value  which  follows  'HTI'  or  'HTD'
                initialises  the  elevation  datum  to  that  value.  Increment or
                decrement of this elevation datum is achieved by functions buttons
                whilst digitising (see section 10.3.1 para k).

                     The default method of coding elevations without  the  use  of
                'HTD'  or  'HTI'  is to use the feature serial number entry in the
                IFF file (the NF number - see IFF reference manual).  More  detail
                of  using  Laseraid  in  either  normal  'feature' mode or special
                'height' mode is given in sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2

       There now follows several examples of  the  command  strings  necessary  to
  invoke Laseraid.

  Laseraid divides naturally into three stages.


  STAGE 1


                The first stage is where various necessary machine parameters  and
                system  calibrations are set-up.  It includes the measurement of a
                standard grid and  the  control  points,  and  input  of  operator
                identification  details,  feature coding schemes to be used and so
                on.  See section 9


  STAGE 2


                This is the stage in which the feature (an edge,line or symbol) to
                be  digitised  is  selected and any extra details such as its code
                and hierarchical level (layer) is supplied.  See section 10


  STAGE 3


                This is the actual scanning process:  here, measurements which are
                determined by Lasertrak produce digitised coordinates to represent
                linear features in a numeric, vector form.  See Section  10.3  and
                10.4

                The results generated during stage three can be  either  accepted,
                or  rejected  if errors have been made.  In any event, the program
                will return to stage two for the selection and coding of the  next
                feature.    A   typical  digitising  session  will  then  comprise
                alternating between  stages  two  and  three  until  the  work  is
                complete  when  the  'end-of-session'  command  'EOS'  is given to
                terminate the Laseraid program and return the operator to VMS main
                mode.

       Once Laseraid has been invoked successfully (as  described  in  Section  8)
  there  are  four confirmation messages.  The first gives the version of laseraid
  which is implemented, the second confirms the designated parameter (or  'patch')
  file,  the  third  confirms  the  destination  IFF file, and the fourth confirms
  successful initialisation.  For example, the following command string

                          [1mLAJ  IFF  FRED  WITH  PATCH.116[0m

  might produce

       Laseraid [LAJ] of 11:28:36   01-Jun-1986
       LSL$LK:PATCH.116;0
       LSL$IF:FRED.IFF
       Initialisation completed

  line 1 gives the current version of Laseraid being run
  lines 2 and 3 confirm the parameter file and target output file being  used  and
  the  statement  'Initialisation completed' is the final response to confirm that
  Laseraid has started correctly and is awaiting a command from the operator.

       Commands are supplied by the operator  to  the  program  via  the  function
  buttons  (FBs)  and  the  close-up screen keyboard.  In general, the most common
  commands at any time are available on the function buttons, whilst  less  common
  commands  (and  those  requiring numbers or text as arguments) are given via the
  close-up screen keyboard.  All commands available on the function buttons at any
  time  are  equally  available  via  the  keyboard  and  are given as their three
  character mnemonic names.  Typing the command "?" at the keyboard  at  any  time
  when  a  command  is expected will print out all the commands available (both on
  the function buttons and the close-up keyboard).  Typing  "??"  will  provide  a
  summary  of  all  the  Laseraid  commands  available in the current mode, whilst
  "? command" will give an explanation of that command.

       Laseraid does not give operators any prompt character  (as  does  VMS,  for
  example,  with its dollar sign).  However, the function buttons have the ability
  to light-up and extinguish to show both program status and the  availability  of
  options at any one time.

       A function button numbering system  ([1mD[0m30)  is  used  throughout  Laser-Scan
  documentation and this is explained below

       In  general,  only  those  function  buttons  which  have  relevance  in  a
  particular  stage  of the Laseraid program are illuminated.  The meaning of some
  buttons do change in different modes of the program, though  some  preserve  the
  same  meaning  throughout;  FB16  is an example of this latter case as it always
  means ABAndon, which is the failure exit, returning the operator to the previous
  level  and undoing as much as possible as it goes.  FB4 is usually ACCept, which
  is the successful completion.  Other buttons are used for commands  specific  to
  that  program  level.   The extra commands are positioned so that the pattern of
  function button lights is easily recognisable for  each  level,  and  this  will
  become relevant in subsequent sections of this manual.

       Commands at the keyboard are recognised by their first three letters, hence
  ABA  is  sufficient  for the ABANDON command.  Those commands requiring either a
  numeric or a text argument should have the complete details typed  on  the  same
  line.   A  full  summary of Laseraid commands is given in the Laseraid Reference
  Manual:  they are listed also in Appendix A of this manual.

       Once  Laseraid  has  been   invoked   successfully   (and   the   statement
  'Initialisation  completed' is given on the close-up screen), the program enters
  the main mode level.  This is  the  basic  level  of  Laseraid  from  which  all
  subsequent  modes  are  entered to perform specific tasks.  More details on Main
  Mode level are given in section 10.3; confirmation of Main Mode Level  is  given
  by the pattern of function button lights as shown below:

                     ----- ----- ----- -----



       The first  procedure  advisable  once  Laseraid  has  been  started  is  to
  determine  and  confirm  that  the  scanning  hardware is reading the source map
  correctly.  To perform this tuning, the operator should enter 'check mode' which
  is achieved by typing the three character mnemonic

                                 [1mCHK      [0m<return>

  on the close-up screen keyboard whilst in main mode.

       The result is to place control into Laseraid check mode which is  confirmed
  by the function button pattern of lights:

       The major other commands available in check mode from the close-up keyboard
  are  detailed  in  the  Lasertrak Reference Manual.  Under normal circumstances,
  there are only a few additional commands with which basic  operators  should  be
  familiar; these are listed below:

       Other commands may be manipulated to tune the Lasertrak  on  each  occasion
  that a new series of maps is to be digitised.  This detailed tuning need only be
  carried out once for a map series and it is advisable that this be performed  by
  a competent system manager.

       Details on Lasertrak tuning are given in the Lasertrak Reference Manual.



  9.4.1  [3mProcedures[0m [3mIn[0m [3mCHK[0m [3mMode[0m -

       In most cases, the abridged summary of commands  shown  above  (in  section
  9.4)  are all that basic operators need to be aware of when they wish to start a
  digitising session.  A detailed description  of  the  procedures  necessary  for
  machine tuning follows with a brief, repeat summary of all the actions necessary
  at the end.

      (a)  The operator should scan the document to be digitised visually as it is
           being  displayed on the photochromic display and select one or a series
           of line portions which are considered to be representative of the whole
           map.   He should then show to Laseraid his choice of line; this portion
           of line need be no longer than about 0.25 - 0.4 inches in length.   The
           STArt  command  (FB1) is used to show laseraid where his choice of line
           (or vector) begins.  The operator should steer the laser  cursor  cross
           with  the  trackerball to the start of the line portion and depress FB1
           to issue a STArt command to Laseraid.  The effect that this  will  have
           is to anchor a start point on the test line.

      (b)  The operator then shows Laseraid where his test line portion should end
           -  remember  to  keep  its  length to about 0.3 inches.  To do this, he
           moves the laser cursor gently along the test line  to  a  new  position
           0.25 - 0.4 inches away from the anchor point defined in (a) above.

      (c)  Stages (a) and (b) above have now defined the start and end position of
           a  short  vector  to be used to tune certain parameters which Lasertrak
           needs to be able to follow lines automatically.  Now this test  portion
           has  been  defined it need not be re-defined unless the operator wishes
           to repeat the exercise on other test portions.  There are  three  basic
           parameters  which should be tuned with this test portion of line; these
           are the Phase (PHA), the threshold (THR) and the  focus  (FOC).   These
           procedures are explained in stages (d) to (f) below.

      (d)  The focus is the first parameter that  should  be  tuned  under  normal
           circumstances,  [3mbut[0m  [3mthis[0m  [3mcan[0m  [3monly[0m  [3mbe[0m [3machieved[0m [3msuccessfully[0m [3mby[0m [3mfirst[0m

                To set a high threshold, the operator depresses  FB9  to  issue  a
           THReshold  command  to  Laseraid.  This command causes the Lasertrak to
           scan across the test line and produce a graph and  cross-hairs  on  the
           close-up screen.  Typical examples could be as shown below


           Examples


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 35


                The graphs serve to show the operator a visual  representation  of
           what  the  Lasertrak has seen as it scans [3macross[0m the test line from one
           edge to the other.  Thus, diagram (i) is a good scan - the plateau peak
           represents a clear white line with well defined edges.  Diagram (ii) is
           equally acceptable since a plateau  is  evident;  the  uncharacteristic
           peak  to  the  left  is probably due to some noise also detected by the
           scanner or fluctuations in the black areas of  the  negative.   Diagram
           (iii) is rather more alarming; there is no clear plateau which suggests
           that the line being scanned has a poor contrast quality or  is  on  the
           limits of minimum line-width for line-following.  Operators are advised
           that line-following performance may be degraded  with  such  lines  and
           that  care  should be taken.  Other remedies could be to try a negative
           of better image contrast or to use a smaller reduction  factor  in  the
           photography and to perform the digitising in halves (see section 4).

                A high threshold setting as required by the Focus  calibration  is
           assigned  by  positioning  the close-up screen cursor with the keyboard
           cursor control keys to the far right edge of the threshold  graphs  and
           hitting the space-bar.


           Examples:  high threshold settings
















      (e)  The setting of the Focus is now possible and is achieved by  depressing
           FB13  to issue 'FOC' to Laseraid.  This causes Lasertrak to re-scan the
           test line portion and generate a Focus graph on  the  close-up  screen.
           If  the operator has not pressed FB4 (to issue a 'TXZ' - clear close-up
           screen command) before starting this stage then the Focus graph will be
           superimposed  on  the  threshold  graph  from stage d above.  The Focus
           graph always has a much lower peak than does the threshold graph and  a
           correct  Focus  setting  is  achieved  by  steering the close-up screen
           cursors to the Focus peak and hitting the  space-bar.   To  distinguish
           between  threshold  and  focus in the example below, the focus graph is
           shown as a dashed line.  It is advisable  to  perform  focus  tests  as
           described  above  in  two  directions  of  test  line.   Horizontal and
           vertical test lines should be used to reduce the  chances  of  a  badly
           astigmatic spot.

      (f)  The threshold parameter  should  now  be  set  correctly  and  this  is
           achieved  by repeating stage (d) above, though positioning the close-up
           screen cursor to about the centre of the threshold plateau peak.  It is
           also advisable to clear the close-up screen first by depressing FB4.


           Example
           Correct threshold













                NOTE:  threshold determines how much  detail  the  Lasertrak  will
           see.   Setting  the  close-up  screen  cursor  more  to the left of the
           plateau makes it see more (good for faint lines).  Settings  nearer  to
           the  right  makes  it  see  less  and hence is useful in very cluttered
           areas.  This threshold can always be modified slightly as digitising is
           taking place to ensure good machine set-up and best digitising quality.

      (g)  It is at this stage  where  operators  can  experiment  with  different
           portions  of  representative  test  lines  to  obtain  a  good  average
           threshold reading.  It is possible to repeat stages (a), (b) and (f) on
           different  line  portions.  It is generally not necessary to repeat the
           focus procedures as defined in stages (d) and (e).

      (h)  Setting the PHAse corrections in both axes  (horizontal  and  vertical)
           follows  next.  Operators should repeat the procedure detailed below on
           two test lines - one that is vertical and one that is horizontal (or as
           near  as  possible).   The  test  lines  should  be clear, straight and
           continuous (i.e.  not broken).  First choose the test line  and  define
           its  start  and  end  with  FB1 (see stage (a) and (b) above).  Second,
           clear the close-up screen with FB4.  Third, press  the  PHAse  function
           button,  FB5.   Since  Lasertrak  can  scan lines both horizontally and
           vertically, it is important that these scans  are  produced  in  phase;


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 37


           this phase is different for different frequencies and different widths.
           Phase measurement is performed by Lasertrak automatically in most cases
           and  is  confirmed on the close-up screen as a near-straight line graph
           crossing a horizontal line.  There will  be  a  series  of  these  near
           straight-line graphs for each of the line types that Lasertrak knows to
           expect from details held in its  parameter  file.   The  correct  phase
           setting  is  achieved  where the line-graphs cross the horizontal line.
           In most cases, Laseraid can determine this for itself.


           Example
           Phase Correction













                This procedure is repeated for both vertical and  horizontal  test
           lines

      (i)  The final parameters which can be set easily in this  cycle  of  events
           are the Red/Blue offsets and counts ratios; this procedure involves the
           use of commands WHL (FB3) and OCR (FB2).   These  measurements  do  not
           involve  the  scanning  of  white  lines  on the source negative but of
           artificial white lines of known characteristics which are drawn by  the
           Lasertrak  on  a  light area of the photochromic film.  It was for this
           reason that a black opaque area was suggested to  be  included  on  the
           film master at the photography stage (see section 4.5.2).  First, it is
           important to select a different line type for white  line  drawing  and
           this is achieved by typing at the close-up screen keyboard the command


                                [1mTYP 1[0m      <carriage return>

                Next, show the Lasertrak where you wish the artificial white  line
           to  be  drawn.   Use  the STArt command (FB1) and mark a line vector of
           half an inch length (as explained in stage (a) above) on a  clear  area
           of  the  photochromic display.  The test line being constructed must be
           either horizontal or vertical - you will repeat the exercise  for  both
           in any case.

                Next depress FB3 (the WHL (white line) command) and notice that  a
           white  line  with  dark  background  is constructed on the photochromic
           display.  Repeated use of the WHL command is suggested to ensure a very
           clear  white  line  with  dark background.  If for any reason the white
           line is not seen to be drawn, it means that Lasertrak's blue  laser  is
           not operative; seek further help in such situations.

                The actual measurements of offsets and counts ratios  can  now  be
           performed  by  depressing FB2 to invoke the OCR command.  The Lasertrak
           is seen to scan repeatedly the white line and display on  the  close-up
           screen  a  graphic representation of the offsets and counts ratios that
           it sees.  The graphs produced - commonly known as the 'goal-posts'  are
           shown below:


           Example:
           Offset and Counts Ratios













                A good measurement is confirmed by a near-straight diagonal  line.
           Repeated  measurement  by  depressing  OCR  (FB2) again can improve the
           result.  Usual reasons for failure -  i.e.   diagonals  which  are  not
           straight  - are caused by poor quality white-lines (repeat WHL) or poor
           threshold settings (repeat threshold measurement).  It  is  recommended
           that OCR is performed at least twice.

                Repeat WHL and OCR for both horizontal and vertical white lines.

      (j)  This concludes the routine set-up procedures which are carried  out  in
           check  mode,  though  there  are  many  other  procedures  involved  in
           Lasertrak tuning  which  are  detailed  in  the  User's  Guide.   Basic
           operators should not concern themselves with these.

      (k)  The four remaining function buttons in check mode which have  not  been
           discussed  provide  either  confidence  checks  or  aids to the machine
           tuning operations.  They are summarised below:

          (i)  QUL (FB14) and QUW (FB15) give  quantitative  measurements  of  the
               quality  of  digitising.   QUL measures the quality of the observed
               line  position  with  respect  to  time  and  QUW  measures   width
               variations  with  respect  to  positions across the scan.  They are
               used on any orientation of straight lines.

         (ii)  CLO (FB12) provides close-up images on the close-up screen  of  the
               source  data seen by a single scan of the Lasertrak in any selected
               location which is defined by the laser cursor.  This is by far  the
               most  useful  tool  which  the  operator  has to confirm successful
               tuning.  It should always be used after set-up to  check  for  good
               scans and clean line connections at junctions.

        (iii)  CUR  (FB8)  provides  an  interactive  procedure  to  aligning  the
               position  of  the laser cursor by means of the magnified images and
               cursor displayed on the close-up  screen.   Its  use  is  described

  9.5.1  [3mOverview[0m -

       The coordinate system used internally by the Lasertrak (which in most cases
  is  transparent  to  its  users) is somewhat different to the coordinate systems
  used in mapping.  Moreover, there are distortions in the Lasertrak's measurement
  system  -  due in part to non-linearities in the machine's optics and in part to
  photographic distortions introduced into  the  source  fiche  negatives  by  the
  various  enlargement  and  reduction  processes  which  have  been  carried  out
  beforehand.  For all of these reasons it is  ESSENTIAL  that  the  Lasertrak  is
  calibrated  each  time  a  new [3mbatch[0m of source photography is to be digitised or
  after major hardware repair.

       In essence, system calibration involves the generation of a  set  of  cubic
  coefficients  which  are  held  in  the  relevant  Laseraid  parameter  files to
  compensate for all of the distortions cited above.  It follows, therefore,  that
  there  will  be different parameter files for each batch of photography [3mAND[0m also
  for each different Lasertrak machine.  Further, re-calibrations of all parameter
  files  which  are  pertinent to a particular machine should be carried out after
  any maintenance work has been performed on the machine's optics system.

       The actual calibration procedure (i.e.  the generation of the set of  cubic
  coefficients)  is  achieved  by instructing Laseraid to measure the positions of
  the intersecting lines of a [3mstandard[0m [3mgrid[0m.  Source negatives of this  grid  will
  have  been  made at the same time that the relevant batch of map photography was
  being carried out (see section 4.6).  A more reliable set of  coefficients  will
  be  generated  if  many  grid  intersections  are  measured.  The minimum number
  allowed is  sixteen,  though  Laser-Scan  suggests  at  least  twenty  five  for
  production  work.   Indeed,  the  calibration  sections of the software will not
  allow too few (or inappropriate) points to be  measured,  reporting  "BAD  POINT
  DISTRIBUTION"  if  attempts  are  made.   The following sub-section describes in
  detail the procedures that should be performed for machine calibration.



  9.5.2  [3mLasertrak[0m [3mCalibration[0m [3mProcedure[0m -

      (a)  A good contrast source negative of the standard grid  relevant  to  the
           current batch of photography is inserted into the Lasertrak system (see
           section 6).

      (b)  After Lasertrak has been tuned in check  mode  (see  section  9.4)  and
           whilst  Laseraid  is in main mode, the calibration procedure is invoked
           with the three-letter mnemonic

                                             [1mCAL[0m

                This is the abbreviation for CALibrate and  is  entered  from  the
           close-up screen keyboard followed by carriage return.

      (c)  Confirmation that Laseraid  is  in  CALibrate  mode  is  given  by  the
           function button lights as shown below

                Also appearing in the top right-hand corner  of  the  photochromic
           display  screen  is  a  red  cursor  cross  with  the  adjacent message
           "upper-right".  At this stage, Laseraid is requesting the extremes  and
           pitch  of  the  grid  to  be  measured.   Note  that  at  least sixteen
           intersections should be measured and their locations should  cover  the
           extremes of digitising area on the photochromic display screen in order
           to give a reliable set of cubic-coefficients.  There are  two  commands
           (both  available  on  the  function  buttons)  at  this  stage  in  the
           calibration procedure.  The usual command ABAndon is available on  FB16
           and this abandons calibrate mode and returns command to main mode.  The
           second command is OK or 'accept' which is available on FB4.

                The UPPER-RIGHT extreme of the  calibration  grid  is  defined  by
           directing  the  laser cursor cross with the trackerball to the required
           grid intersection.  This position is confirmed by then  depressing  FB4
           to enter it and proceed to the next stage.

      (d)  Calibrate mode then seeks to determine the lower-left  extreme  of  the
           calibration  grid.   The  red laser cursor-cross is seen to move to the
           lower-left area of the photochromic display and the prompt "lower-left"
           appears  adjacent  to  it.   The location of this lower-left extreme is
           then selected with the trackerball and confirmed with FB4 "OK".

      (e)  It is then necessary to show the calibrate mode the x and y grid  pitch
           or  'steps'  to  be  used.  The laser cursor should be directed via the
           trackerball to the required x increment (x direction is  considered  to
           be  along a horizontal line, y is along a vertical line).  Confirmation
           is given with FB4 "OK".

      (f)  The y-pitch or step is supplied in a similar  way  to  x  in  step  (e)
           above.

      (g)  Once the details of the calibration grid  have  been  supplied  as  per
           steps  (c) - (f) above, it is then possible to perform the intersection
           measures.  In fact,  the  Lasertrak  will  have  already  attempted  to
           measure  the  first lower-left intersection and confirmation of success
           will have been given with a bleep from the close-up terminal and  entry

           into  the second phase of the calibration procedure.  This second phase
           involves the measurement of each grid intersection and a report of each
           success  or failure.  Confirmation of entry into phase two of calibrate
           mode is given by a new pattern of lights on  the  function  buttons  as
           shown below:  each of the commands available have importance.

           The following commands are available on the function buttons

                FB2   -   AUT   -   automatic re-scan
                FB4   -   OK    -   accept measure
                FB8   -   MAN   -   request manual measure
                FB12  -   SKI   -   skip or ignore a poor measure
                FB13  -   CON   -   request automatic, continuous 
                                    calibration
                FB16  -   NO    -   quit the calibration and return 
                                    to main mode

                Note above that FB13 has importance here, since although it has no
           illumination,   it  is  accommodating  a  command  "CON".   It  has  no
           illumination as yet, because it is a flip-flop command; it is an option
           that  can  be either requested or ignored - the default in this case is
           for it to be ignored.  See step (l) below for details of its use.

      (h)  The procedure now is to measure each of the assigned grid intersections
           in  turn - the Lasertrak knows where each of these are by virtue of the
           grid details supplied to it in steps (c) - (f) above.  The  measurement
           procedure  is performed automatically; it is the job of the operator to
           confirm success of  a  measure  with  the  "OK"  command  (FB4).   This
           acceptance  enables  the  Lasertrak to proceed to the next intersection
           for measurement.  As each measurement is carried out, its acceptance is
           confirmed  by a small cross shown on the close-up screen which overlays
           exactly the measured point.  Each grid intersection is measured in this
           way  until the complete grid (as defined initially by the operator) has
           been examined.  There are a number of other provisions  and  facilities
           in  the  calibration measurement procedure of which operators should be
           aware - these are described in steps (i) - (l) below.

           descriptions  of  calibration  given  thus  far  have  assumed that the
           Lasertrak is able to detect and measure  each  grid  intersection  with
           total  success.   However,  there are occasions when some intersections
           cannot be detected correctly - possibly because of a low contrast or  a
           poor source negative or conflict with linework.  On such occasions, the
           Lasertrak will report its failure by issuing on the close-up screen the
           command


                                   "Manual measure please"


           At this point, there are a number of options open to the operator.   On
           pressing  FB2  to issue a "AUT" command, the Lasertrak is instructed to
           attempt a re-scan on the suspect point.  This can be  repeated  several
           times,  though  continued  failure may mean performing a manual measure
           (see j below) or skipping it altogether (see k below).

           intersection have failed as outlined in step (i) above, it is necessary
           to  request  operator  intervention  to measure a point manually.  This
           request is made with FB8 at which time the  command  'MAN'  is  issued.
           Manual  measure  involves  the Lasertrak scanning the grid intersection
           and displaying at very enlarged scale on the close-up screen the  lines
           as  seen  by  the  scan.  The cross hair cursors are also displayed and
           these can be pointed to the intersection centre by means of the  cursor
           control  keys  and  sent to Laseraid by hitting the space-bar.  In this
           way the grid intersection is measured and Lasertrak will pass on to the
           next intersection as normal.

           that  neither an automatic measure by Lasertrak nor a manual measure by
           the operator has produced reliable results (perhaps because of  a  poor
           source  image)  it  is  possible  to  skip  and  ignore  the  offending
           intersection.  This is achieved by depressing FB12 to SKIp rather  than
           depressing  FB4  to accept or FB8 to request manual measure.  Operators
           are advised not to ignore too many intersections  (especially  locally)
           and  certainly to be aware of the minimum acceptable number of measures
           for calculating the cubic-coefficients (see section 9.5.1).

           circumstances, this option is very useful and can speed the calibration
           exercise  considerably.   The  default  option  is  for CON not to run;
           operators may select it by depressing FB13 (which will be confirmed  by
           the   illumination   of  FB13).   Continuous  measurement  enables  the
           Lasertrak to proceed automatically from grid point-to-grid  point  with
           no  pause,  providing  that  each  intersection is seen clearly without
           confusion or error.  This  means  that  operators  no  longer  have  to
           confirm  acceptance of a measurement between points.  In the event that
           a bad measure is encountered, the Lasertrak will  halt  the  continuous
           option and request "Manual Measure please".  At this point the operator
           can either attempt a re-scan (AUT),  manual  measure  (MAN)  or  ignore
           (SKI)  as  desired.   Re-activation  of  the  CONtinuous option is then
           achieved by further depressing FB13.

           of  the  calibration  grid  has  been measured and accepted, the system
           automatically  reports  the  quality  of  calibration  exercise.    The
           following  details  are displayed on the close-up screen:  confirmation
           of the number of points which have been measured  and  accepted  and  a
           statement  of  the  residuals  obtained  between measured and corrected
           point locations.  The summary of the residuals are given in a  form  as
           shown in the example below.

                The  above  diagram  reports  the  quality  of  the   measurements
           performed (in units known to Laser-Scan as HRD counts).  Users need not
           be too familiar with those units, though it  should  be  realised  that
           residuals  of  greater  than  15 HRD counts are too large and should be
           re-measured.  In fact, 1 HRD-count represents approximately 1 micron on
           the  negative.  The matrix of numbers on the close-up screen represents
           (by measured intersection location) the residuals in  the  x  direction
           (upper)  and  y direction (lower).  Thus in the example cited above the
           reading of x=23, y=13 in row 2, column 2 ought to be re-measured.  This
           is  attempted  by  either  auto  re-scan (FB2) or manual measure (FB8).
           Note that row 3 column 2 is a grid intersection without  any  readings,
           as that intersection was skipped.

                The acceptance or rejection of a set of readings  is  achieved  by
           either   depressing   FB4   ("OK"  command)  or  FB16  ("NO"  command).
           Acceptance enables Laseraid to generate the new cubic coefficients  and
           return  the  user  to  main  mode.  Rejection enables users to re-scan,
           manual measure or skip intersections as described before.

       1.  Ensure that standard calibration grid negatives for  current  batch  of
           photography  is  in Lasertrak and that appropriate machine set-up 'CHK'
           mode has been performed.

       2.  Enter CALibrate mode from main mode with command CAL.

       3.  Using trackerball and laser cursor fix the extreme NE grid intersection
           with FB4 "OK".

       4.  Using trackerball and laser cursor fix the extreme SW grid intersection
           with FB4 "OK".

       5.  Using trackerball and laser  cursor  define  the  x-step  increment  by
           positioning  the laser cursor on the next required grid intersection to
           the East of the SW corner.  Confirm its position with FB4 "OK".

       6.  Using trackerball and laser  cursor  define  the  y-step  increment  by
           positioning  the laser cursor on the next required grid intersection to
           the north of the SW corner.  Confirm its position with FB4 "OK".

       7.  Depress the CONtinuous command flip/flop button (FB13) and  accept  the
           measure of the SW corner intersection.

       8.  Observe the  automatic  continuous  measures  of  each  nominated  grid
           intersection.  Intervene with help (AUTo rescans (FB2), MANual measures
           (FB8) or SKIp points (FB12)) as necessary, when requested.

       9.  Observe quality of total measures and  refine  any  which  are  outside
           tolerance  (greater  than 15 units) with AUTo re-scans (FB2) and MANual
           measures (FB8).

      10.  Accept total measures with ACCept (FB4).

       In order to digitise with an appropriate scaling and coordinate system,  it
  is necessary for operators to measure the positions of the control points on the
  Lasertrak  and  supply  details  of  their  known  Cartesian  coordinates.   The
  positions  of  the  control points need not be square in relation to each other,
  but they should be located as near to the edges of the map extremes as  possible
  -  certainly  no  more than 10 per cent of the sheets total length away from the
  edge.  The control points should also be clear with a high line-contrast; it may
  have  been  necessary  to enhance the clarity of the map control points prior to
  the photography stage (see section 4.5.1).



  9.6.2  [3mMeasure[0m [3mProcedure[0m [3m-[0m [3mControl[0m [3mPoints[0m [3m(CP)[0m -

       Once the map negative is mounted  correctly  on  its  film  holder  in  the
  Lasertrak,  it  is  possible  to  measure  the  control  points  and  assign the
  coordinate system.  The individual steps  below  describe  the  sequence  of  CP
  measurement.

      (a)  Control point measurement is performed by issuing the command

                                  [1mCP[0m      <carriage return>

           on the close-up screen's keyboard whilst in main mode.

      (b)  The action of step (a) places Laseraid in control point measuring  mode
           and  the  laser  cursor  will move automatically to the vicinity of the
           first control point to be  measured.   By  convention,  all  Laser-Scan
           systems  and  software  adopt  the  following sequence (or ordering) of
           control points:  NW,SW,SE,NE.  Thus, the laser cursor in  Measure  mode
           will  first attempt to scan and measure the NW control point.  If it is
           successful it will display the default coordinates to be  used  on  the
           close-up   screen   and   seek   confirmation  of  acceptance.   If  it
           unsuccessful in finding the control point, the message


                                    "Can't find fiducial"


           is displayed with an audible "bleep".

      (c)  In failure situations when attempting to scan control point  locations,
           operators should reposition the laser cursor on the appropriate control
           point and attempt either an AUTo re-scan  (FB2)  or  a  MANual  measure
           (FB8).   The  function button options available this time are described
           below

                FB2   -   AUT   -   automatic re-scan control point
                FB4   -   OK    -   accept measurement
                FB8   -   MAN   -   perform manual measure
                FB16  -   NO    -   reject point and abandon Measure mode



      (d)  Once a successful control measurement has been achieved  (confirmed  by
           accurate  superimposition of the red laser cross on the source negative
           cross) it is then necessary to accept it.

                This is achieved with (FB4) "OK".  As  an  alternative,  rejection
           would be to perform a re-scan with AUT (FB2) or a manual measure (FB8).
           Pressing "NO" (FB16) does not reject a single point;  it  quit  Measure
           mode  completely  and  returns  command  to  main  mode.  Note all four
           control points must have  been  measured  and  accepted  before  it  is
           possible to digitise line work.

      (e)  At this same time, it is possible (and may be necessary) to  issue  new
           control  point  coordinates.   These  are  assigned by typing-in on the
           close-up screen keyboard the new values for x and  y  (separated  by  a
           space)  immediately  prior to control point acceptance with (FB4) "OK".
           The default values which are assumed by the system  if  no  others  are
           supplied,  are those which were used during the last run of the current
           Lasertrak parameter (or patch) file.

      (f)  There are some important considerations of  control  point  assignments
           and these are discussed in section 9.6.4).

      (g)  The remaining control points (SW,SE,NE) are  measured  in  exactly  the
           same way.  On each occasion, the laser cursor will look in the vicinity
           of the relevant control point in an attempt to find  and  measure  each
           one.

      (h)  Once all four control points  have  been  measured  and  accepted,  the
           close-up  screen  displays  their  details  (including  new  coordinate
           values, if supplied) and operators have a final chance to  accept  "OK"
           (FB4)  or  reject  "NO" (FB16) them.  Acceptance passes on to the final

           fiducial error stage (see step i) and rejection quits Measure mode  and
           returns directly to main mode.

      (i)  [3mFiducial[0m [3mOptics[0m [3mCheck[0m.  The final stage of the control point  procedure
           is the assignment of an appropriate threshold value for an optics check
           which gives confidence of accurate digitising.  This  is  an  automatic
           fiducial  check  performed  at intervals automatically by the system to
           test for such unlikely events as optics drift.  The check is  performed
           by  re-measuring  the  position  of  a  nominated control point after a
           specified number of features have  been  digitised.   If  the  measured
           displacement  is  greater  than the nominated tolerance, it will report
           the fact to the operator who will have to re-measure the control points
           again  as  described  in  this section (9.6.2).  The initial set -up of
           this fiducial check is made at this stage in the  procedure.   Laseraid
           requests  responses  to  be  given  via  the  close-up  terminal to the
           following three questions:


           "WHICH CORNER AS FIDUCIAL (1-4)?"

                     - operators should choose a clear, distinct control  for  the
                     fiducial  check;  the number supplied represents the standard
                     Laser-Scan ordering

                         -1   =   Select an additional control point
                          1   =   NW
                          2   =   SW
                          3   =   SE
                          4   =   NE
                          0   =   do not run fiducial check at all.

                     [3mNote[0m [3m:[0m  If -1 is selected on subsequent  remeasuring  of  the
                     control  points,  then  the  values  entered for the fiducial
                     checks from the previous measurements will be reassigned.  In
                     order  to  redefine  the  additional  control  point  for the
                     fiducial check it is necessary to issue the following command
                     whilst in main mode:

                                                [1mCHF[0m [1m0[0m [1m0[0m

                     - The operator will  then  be  able  to  select  a  different
                     control point for the fiducial check.


           "EVERY HOW MANY FEATURES?"

                     - Laseraid expects a nominated number of features to  dictate
                     the  frequency  of  the  fiducial check - Laser-scan suggests
                     every 5 features.  Thus the fiducial check would be performed
                     automatically each time five features have been digitised.


           "MAX PERMITTED ERROR?"

                     - this is the allowable distance error of  measured  position
                     in  microns  (1/ 1000th of mm) - Laser-Scan suggests every 15
                     microns

       Appropriate responses to each of these questions will give the confirmation
  message, for example


  "FID 3 EVERY 5 FEATURES WITH ERROR LIMIT OF 15 MICRONS"


  on the close-up screen and control then passes automatically to  main-mode.   In
  the event that the fiducial error limit is reported to have been exceeded whilst
  digitising, it is necessary for the operator to quit digitising temporarily  and
  re-enter  Measure  mode for control point remeasurement.  If continuous drift is
  reported by the system during a digitising session,  it  is  advisable  to  seek
  advise from the Laser-Scan Service Department.

       1.  The Lasertrak assumes that all source documents are to be digitised  in
           a   rectangular  Cartesian  coordinate  grid  system.   All  distances,
           therefore, are linear and a square map space is assumed.   All  control
           point entries are placed in Layer 0.

       2.  All  data  files  generated  by  Laseraid   digitising   software   are
           unprocessed  initially.   This  means  that although details of control
           coordinates have been supplied at machine set-up  time,  all  generated
           digitising  is  held  in  a special Lasertrak "calibration space" until
           such time as the file is run through  a  post-processing  stage  (after
           digitising  is  completed) - see section 11.  Therefore, it is possible
           to alter the values of the control points before the file is  processed
           into  the  specified  map  coordinates.  The post-processing program is
           called LAPROCESS.  (see section 11)


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 51


       3.  Operators should be aware of the  limits  of  coordinate  precision  in
           Laser-Scan's  IFF data files.  Sufficient storage is reserved in IFF to
           enable a single ordinate to be held with full precision by  up  to  six
           figures.   This  means  that  coordinates of a greater length will lose
           accuracy.  For these reasons, it is recommended that operators digitise
           into  a coordinate system which falls within these precision limits.  A
           good solution is to digitise locally into a millimetre or inches system
           relative  to  a maps South West corner.  Full eight or nine figure grid
           references are not acceptable and in such cases operators  are  advised
           to  relate  grid  values  to  some local offset datum which reduces the
           values of the coordinates over the map being digitised.


       In general, Laseraid will report problems with control point distributions,
  although  care  should  be taken in the assignment of control point values.  The
  message

                     "Bad corner points or cubic coefficients"

  for example, suggests that the combination of  measured  control  locations  and
  supplied  coordinates do not give a valid, square digitising space and operators
  are advised to re-check the control  locations,  their  measured  position,  the
  supplied  coordinates  and  in extreme cases also the previously run CALibration
  procedure.

  9.7  [3mOperator[0m [3mIdentification[0m

       There  are  facilities  within  the  IFF  structure  to  hold  single  line
  descriptions  of  text  which can be used by operators to identify files of data
  uniquely.  These single lines of text are held within the NS entry of IFF  files
  (see  the  IFF  user's  guide  for  details).   The maximum number of characters
  comprising the line of text is restricted to seventy-two.

       By default, the NS entry is stored with details of the date, time, username
  and  Lasertrak machine number.  It is recommended that these default entries are
  used for everyday operation.  However the  operator  may  override  the  default
  entry by issuing the following command

                                   [1mOP[0m   or   [1mIDE[0m

  Either command is entered via the close-up screen keyboard  whilst  in  Laseraid
  main mode followed by the rest of the line giving the required text details.

  10.1  [3mIntroduction[0m


  At this point, the initialisation for the Lasertrak digitising process will have
  been  completed.   Therefore,  stage one (as described in section 9.1) will have
  been completed.

  To reiterate:

       1.  Stage one is the  initialisation  or  set-up  stage  as  described  and
           performed  in  section  9.   Stages  two  and  three concern the actual
           line-following (or edge-following) digitising procedures.

       2.  Stage two is considered to be the feature selection stage in which  the
           operator chooses those lines which require to be digitised.  This could
           mean working sequentially across a map sheet - selecting every line  on
           the source document until each has been completed - or it could involve
           just choosing  a  smaller,  sub-set  of  lines  defined  by  the  job's
           specification.

       3.  Stage three is considered to be the  actual  automatic  line  following
           process,  including  any  assistance  and  intervention as deemed to be
           necessary by the operator or  when  requested  by  the  software.   Map
           digitising  is  achieved  by  alternating  between stages two and three
           repeatedly until the job is completed.


       Operators need to be aware of two modes of operation which Laseraid  adopts
  during line digitising:

       1.  [3mMAIN[0m [3mMODE[0m is  the  base  software  level  always  adopted  by  Laseraid
           initially

       2.  [3mHELP[0m [3mMODE[0m is used when operator assistance is being given.  There are a
           number  of  other  sub-modes  which  have a lesser usage, and these are
           described as necessary in the following descriptions.


  Laseraid is capable of following three main varieties of linear feature:

       1.  LINES.  This is the principal type of line following and is  the  chief
           concern  of  this  introductory  document.Lines may include many styles
           such as pecks, curves, thickness variations and so on.

           Laseraid is designed specifically to follow transparent linework  on  a
           black  negative  background.   However,  it  is  possible  to work with
           inverse polarity in  order  to  track  along  the  darkened  centre  of
           parallel  white  lines.   The adjustment of the necessary parameters to
           achieve inverse  polarity  is  described  in  detail  in  the  Laseraid
           Reference Manual.

       2.  AREAS.  In this mode, Laseraid is capable of  following  the  edges  of
           solid  fills.   This  is done by detecting the difference between white
           and black on the negative, rather than detecting the white line on  the
           black background which is performed for normal line following.

       3.  JUNCTIONS.  The philosophy of digitising with junctions  is  to  follow
           lines  and,  if desired, to recognise, display and accept automatically
           the location of each junction  before  continuing  scanning  along  the
           line.   Once  a  junction  has  been  recognised  and  registered,  its
           coordinate position is held within a  rapid  access  list  by  the  VAX
           computer;  this  is  known  as the 'junction list'.  In this way, it is
           easy for operators to return to any junction, that has had one or  more
           arms  digitised, merely by depressing a function button.  Further lines
           to be digitised  which  are  entrant  to  that  junction  can  then  be
           followed.    The   result  is  unique  junction  creation  and  quicker
           throughput for polygon and urban map digitising.  Junctions  remain  in
           this  special  junction  list  throughout the time that there are still
           entrant lines to be digitised.  Once all lines entering a junction have
           been digitised, its entry is removed from the junction list.

                JUNCTION SCANS.  i.e.  the procedures which the Lasertrak performs
           when  it  thinks it has found a junction - are generated automatically.
           By default, the system will know whether or  not  to  expect  junctions
           along a line by virtue of the line-type and scan parameters held in the
           system parameter file.  However, junction recognition expectancy can be
           overruled  and  turned  on  or off interactively by means of a function
           button.  Furthermore, in the event that  the  Lasertrak  is  unable  to
           recognise  a  junction  automatically,  there  are  facilities by which
           junction locations can be defined interactively (i.e.  manually) either
           by  means of the laser cursor position or the close-up screen facility.
           Typical evidence that a junction  has  not  been  spotted  successfully
           could  include the inability to display junction arms before continuing
           automatically or when the laser does stop at a junction with tram-lines
           being  displayed  for guidance.  Unless the paint-out facility has been
           suppressed, it will paint-out all lines entrant to a  junction  at  the
           time  when  the digitised feature is accepted.  There are extensions to
           paint-out so that short segments of line always  remain  at  junctions.
           This provides a tool to confirm to operators the position of junctions.

                It is also possible to set up  the  parameter  file  to  recognise
           junctions  and  wait  for  the  operator  to accept the junction before
           continuation of line following.  Details of this use of 'JNC'  for  the
           adjustment  of  the  scan  parameters  to  alter the nature of junction
           recognition, can be found in the Laseraid Reference Manual.

       Before the Lasertrak can begin to digitise any lines  at  the  start  of  a
  digitising  session,  it  is  first  necessary  to select a layer within the IFF
  structure is to be used to place the data.   Details  of  the  hierarchical  (or
  layer)  structure  of  IFF  are given in the IFF Reference Manual.  Confirmation
  that the layer has yet to be selected (when Laseraid has just been  started)  is
  shown by the question mark (?) which appears on the photochromic screen adjacent
  to the laser cursor-cross.  Layer assignment is achieved via the close-up screen
  keyboard  with the command LAY which is followed by a numeric argument to define
  the layer number to be used.  The current maximum number of layers  possible  is
  64, though the naming convention can be any number between 1 and 32767.


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 55


       Typical layer assignment might be achieved by the example below

                            [1mLAY[0m [1m5[0m      <carriage return>

  This will report the confirmation message

                           "Layer 5 created and selected"

  The above message confirms that layer 5 did not exist before  and  that  it  has
  therefore  been  created  and  selected.   If  it already exists (perhaps from a
  previous digitising session) the message would be restricted to:

                                 "Layer 5 selected"

       Further  confirmation  of  successful  layer  selection  is  given  on  the
  photochromic  screen display:  the previous question mark (?) appearing adjacent
  to the  laser  cursor  cross  will  have  changed  to  a  number.   This  number
  corresponds  to  the  current  feature  serial  number of the next feature to be
  digitised (unless the options 'HTD' or 'HTI'  were  specified  on  the  Laseraid
  command  line  to  show  contour elevations instead of serial numbers):  this is
  using Laseraid in height mode - see section 10.2.2



  10.2.1  [3mLaseraid[0m [3mIn[0m [3mNormal[0m [3mFeature[0m [3mMode[0m -

       In the simplest case, the number being shown adjacent to the  laser  cursor
  will  be  1,  showing  that the file being created is new with no other features
  included at present.  Operators are able to change  the  value  of  this  serial
  number  at  will,  by entering the new value required via the close-up keyboard.
  No Laseraid command needs to prefix this number  (though  the  command  'NF'  is
  optional,  if  desired).   As  an  example,  on typing in the value '226' on the
  close-up keyboard (followed by carriage return) it will be seen that value '226'
  appears  adjacent  to  the  laser  cursor  on the photochromic screen.  The next
  feature to be digitised will have serial number 226 and this will be held in the
  IFF entry 'NF' - new feature - see IFF User's Guide.

       By  default,  Laseraid  will  increment  the  base  serial  number  by  one
  automatically  on  each occasion that a feature has been digitised and accepted.
  There are two commands possible to change this incrementing operation.  Both are
  entered  from  the  close-up  keyboard  and both need to be given with a numeric
  argument.

       The two commands are:

  [1mANF n[0m   (set automatic increment of feature number to n)

  [1mMNF n[0m    (set manual increment of feature number to n)

  Use of the commands is easy and logical:  the command

                                       ANF 10

  makes each serial number  be  increment  automatically  by  ten  each  time  the
  previous  feature  is  digitised  and  accepted.   The  use  of  MNF is slightly
  different - it is used in conjunction with two other commands which are provided
  on  two  function  buttons  in Laseraid main-mode.  These two commands are 'INC'


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 56


  (increment - FB15) and 'DEC' (decrement - FB14).  This combination  of  commands
  enables  operators to have total flexibility in assigning feature serial numbers
  manually.  Its operation is described below.  MNF performs in a similar  way  to
  ANF  except that the increment/decrement value (which is defined by the argument
  to the command) is applied manually when operators depress FB14 (DEC)  and  FB15
  (INC).  It is [3messential[0m that operators de-activate the ANF facility if they wish
  to use the MNF option; this is achieved with the command

                                       ANF 0



  10.2.2  [3mLaseraid[0m [3mIn[0m [3mSpecial[0m [3mHeight[0m [3mMode[0m -

       In the case when  Laseraid  is  to  be  used  in  height  mode  (i.e.   the
  parameters  'HTD'  or 'HTI' are included in the Laseraid invoking command line -
  see section 8.2), it is necessary to include  different  commands  to  establish
  elevation (or height) increments and decrements.

       The commands AHT and MHT are analogous to ANF  and  MNF  respectively  (see
  10.2.1).  By setting MHT, it means that DECrement and INCrement on FB14 and FB15
  operate on the coding of elevation data.  ANF still has relevance  and  provides
  mechanisms  to  increment feature serial numbers automatically.  MNF has no real
  effect when using Laseraid in height mode when, no doubt,  MHT  will  have  been
  set.

       This is the software level from which most other  modes  are  selected  and
  entered.   It  is  also  the mode from which Laseraid can be terminated with the
  command EOS (end-of-session).  The  selection  of  features  for  digitising  is
  carried out in main mode.

       Successful entry into Laseraid main mode is confirmed  with  the  following
  pattern of function button lights.

  There are many commands  available  in  Laseraid  main  mode  with  which  basic
  operators  need  not  be  concerned.  Reference to the complete list of commands
  should be made in the Lasertrak Reference Manual.  To serve as an  introduction,
  only  a small sub-set of the most important commands (with which users should be
  aware) are described in this manual.  As usual,  there  are  commands  available
  both  via  the  function  buttons  and from the close-up keyboard; commands most
  widely used are held on the function buttons.

       The first eight function buttons are  used  to  initiate  actions  such  as
  feature select or re-paint.  The next five buttons are used as flip-flops to set
  options such as reverse next feature, and the last three buttons provide control
  functions.

       The function buttons generally have the following meanings,  although  each
  of  the  six feature start buttons (FB1,2,3,5,6,7) can be programmed to refer to
  any line type along with its associated line following mode and its feature  (or
  attribute) code

                        and position laser cursor to the screen centre.


  The meaning and usage of each of the above main mode commands are  explained  in
  detail below.

      (a)  [3mSTR,[0m [3mCUR,[0m [3mRAN,[0m [3mORT[0m [3m-[0m [3mregister[0m [3mline-type[0m

                The meaning of each of the above four commands is  to  register  a
           Line's  type  and  descriptive code prior to digitising for each of the
           following  lines:   Straight,  Curved,  Random  Curved  and  Orthogonal
           respectively.

                The purpose of line-type registration is,  in  fact,  to  aid  the
           feature   selection  stage  of  digitising  (stage  2  in  Laser-Scan's
           philosophy to digitising mentioned in sections 9.1, 10.1 above).   This
           selection  operation  involves  directing  the  laser  cursor  with the
           trackerball to a  position  near  to  the  start  of  the  line  to  be
           digitised.   Once  the operator is happy with the cursor's position, he
           can register it with any of the commands  STR  (FB1),  CUR  (FB2),  RAN
           (FB3)  or  ORT  (FB5).  By this action, he has done a number of things.
           Firstly  he  has  instructed  Laseraid  that   it   can   prepare   for
           line-following  (at  which time it will move into HELP MODE immediately
           to seek assistance - see section 10.4).  Secondly, he has  supplied  an
           attribute  code  for  the  line  which is next in line to be digitised.
           Thirdly, he has warned Laseraid what sort  of  line  characteristic  to
           expect  so  that it can gain an idea of the best line-following methods
           to use from look-up tables in its current  parameter  file.   This  may
           include  line  following,  line following with junction recognition and
           area or edge following.

                In practice, these commands need not be restricted  to  straights,
           curves,  randomly  curves  and  orthogonals.   They really refer to the
           lists of line-following parameters which  best  suit  the  line  to  be
           digitised.   For  example, Laseraid can be tuned so that it will follow
           the black centre line of a double  cased  road  -  thereby  running  in
           inverse  mode.   These  parameters  are  held in the parameter file and
           operators are advised to seek advice locally to best  understand  which
           function  buttons  to  use  for  each  line-type on their own Lasertrak
           installation.

      (b)  [3mREP[0m [3m(FB4)[0m [3m-[0m [3mre-paint[0m [3mout[0m

                The Lasertrak is able to paint-out each line from the photochromic
           display  screen,  once the line has been digitised and accepted.  For a
           number of reasons, the operator  may  wish  to  paint-out  these  lines
           again.   A typical reason might be paint-out fade which re-occurs about
           every  thirty  minutes  as  the  photochromic  film  image  begins   to
           disappear.   Other reasons could be re-paint-out after the selection of
           a clean  frame  of  photochromic  film  or  before  continuation  of  a
           digitising session which was first started on a previous occasion.  The
           command 'REP' on FB4 in main mode forces  Laseraid  to  paint-out  once
           again all lines digitised in the IFF file to-date.

                Use of REP for repaint has its limitations because  it  can  be  a
           fairly  lengthy process when a large digitised file is being processed.
           Operators can always abandon a re-paint  easily  with  'ABA'  on  FB16.


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 60


           'REP'  performs  the  re-paint  in reverse order, thus the latest lines
           digitised are painted out first.  This reverse paint out further  slows
           its  operation.   The advantage of 'REP' is that it can be invoked by a
           function button.  An alternative option is forward paint-out  (the  FOR
           keyboard  command), which is performed more quickly - particularly when
           operators use it in conjunction with the WIN keyboard command to define
           a  window  within  which  re-paint out is to be performed (see item (m)
           below).

                The digitising of  point  features  is  different  in  concept  to
           line-following.  Such features are fixed with the command 'POI' on FB6.
           Operators direct the laser cursor-cross to the vicinity of the point to
           be  digitised  and register its type with FB6 to issue a POInt digitise
           command.  There are two types of point feature capture:

           1.  Restricted to cross symbols:'X' and '+' and 'O's

           2.  Square features - one or more square features such as buildings are
               captured  in  a  single scan and output to the IFF file as one or a
               number of oriented symbols.

           Use of FB6 moves Laseraid into a special sub-mode  for  point  features
           which  is  confirmed  with  a  new pattern of function button lights as
           shown below

                Though the Lasertrak is a line-following scanner,  it  is  equally
           able  to scan small features and register their positions automatically
           without line-following, providing that  they  are  sufficiently  small,
           closed, isolated features.  A general guide to feature size possible is
           all objects of approx maximum size of 1 cm (0.4 inches) square  on  the
           photochromic display screen.

                Small feature digitising is performed  in  the  following  manner.
           First the operator directs the laser cursor with trackerball to a close
           vicinity of the small feature to be digitised.  Its type is  registered
           by  depressing  FB7  to issue a 'SMF' command.  At this point, Laseraid
           moves into small feature mode and the following pattern of lights  will
           illuminate on the function buttons:

                The main Function Buttons for small feature capture in line mode

                                    feature code assigned to FB 7
                FB7   -   SMF   -   repeat SMall Feature scan
                FB12  -   END   -   accept highlighted small feature 
                                    scan
                FB16  -   ABA   -   ABAndon and return to main mode


           Laseraid attempts to scan the small, closed feature automatically.   If
           the  scan and digitising is successful the close-up screen "bleeps" and
           the object is seen to glow in red refresh on the  photochromic  screen.
           The operator is then free to use the above commands to accept or reject
           the digitising.

                In the event that the  small  feature  scan  is  unsuccessful,  no
           audible   "bleep"   is   heard   and  the  extreme  dimensions  of  the
           small-feature scan are shown as a red-refresh box on  the  photochromic
           screen.    Operators  can  attempt  a  re-scan  repeatedly  by  further
           depressing FB7 to issue another SMF command.  At  the  same  time,  the
           trackerball  can be used to re-position the scan box more appropriately
           over the small feature on the photochromic display screen.  As an  aid,
           it  is  suggested  that  small  features  be positioned as close to the
           lower-left extremes of the scan box as possible to ensure a  successful
           measure.   If  repeated scans are unsuccessful, then the feature can be
           digitised with normal line following using FB4

                If the line type of the small feature  to  be  captured  has  been
           set-up  in the parameter file to use edge following then the pattern of
           function button lights will be as follows:

                The operation of this facility is dependent on the line type to be
           used  for digitising.  If simple line following is to be performed then
           GNF will refer to a preset guidance file.  Preguidance is considered to
           be advanced usage of Laseraid and is not discussed in this introductory
           document.

                The  principal  use  of  the  'GNF'  facility  is  when   junction
           recognition  is  enabled.  It only becomes relevant to digitising after
           one or a series of junctions have already  been  recognised  and  their
           positions  are  fixed.   Repeated  use  of  the 'GNF' command (Get Next
           Feature) on FB8 in main mode aids  and  speeds  the  feature  selection
           stage for digitising.  Each time a junction is recognised, its location
           and other details such  as  the  number  of  entrant  links  and  their
           direction  are  entered  into  a  special junction list in the computer
           memory.  This entry remains throughout the time that  there  are  still
           links  to  be digitised which are entrant to that junction.  The action
           of repeated use of 'GNF' (FB8) is to count continually  and  cyclically
           through the current junction list and position the laser cursor exactly
           over each junction in turn.  In most cases, subsequent single scans  by
           selecting  the  desired line-type are able to present to the operator a
           reasonable guess of the likely line from which to  leave  the  junction
           position with line-following.

                Readers are also referred to the keyboard main mode command  'ZIJ'
           which  clears  the  junction  list,  thereby  resetting it to have zero
           items.

                Lasertrak is able to paint-out from the photochromic  display  all
           features  that have been digitised, once they have been accepted by the
           operator when in help mode.  The default option is for  this  paint-out
           facility  to be switched on.  Selection of the Paint-Out Suppress 'POS'
           facility on FB9 at any time whilst in main mode enables  the  paint-out
           facility  to be suppressed.  The result is that all subsequent lines to
           be digitised are no longer painted-out for the entire time that the POS
           option is active.  Confirmation that 'POS' is operative is given by the
           illumination of FB9;  it  is  normally  extinguished.   Once  'POS'  is
           deactivated  (turned-off),  perhaps  at  a later stage, all lines which
           formerly had their paint-out suppressed are then  all  painted  out  as
           soon as the next feature to be digitised is accepted.

                A  typical  reason  for  using  paint-out  suppress  is  to  speed
           digitising rates or to make complex areas easier to see and interpret.

                The FINd option is a very useful facility to  speed  digitising  -
           particularly  on sparse-to-medium density data or easy linework such as
           contours.  The default option is for 'FIN' to be turned-off and  it  is
           activated   whilst   in   Laseraid   main   mode  by  depressing  FB10.


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 64


           Confirmation that 'FIN' has been selected is given by the  illumination
           of FB10; it is normally extinguished.

                Under normal circumstances (when 'FIN' is not selected) digitising
           would  involve the registering of the type of line to be digitised (see
           paragraphs a,c,d above), followed automatically  with  immediate  entry
           into  help  mode  (see  section  10.4)  for  operators to give Laseraid
           further assistance such as the direction to start scanning.

                Use of the 'FIN' option provides facilities to remove much of this
           basic operator assistance - particularly if the direction to follow the
           lines is not too important.  Once 'FIN' has been selected with FB10 the
           operator need merely direct the laser to the vicinity of the line to be
           followed and register its type.  Once this  is  done,  Lasertrak  tries
           automatically  to  find the line and begin to line-follow automatically
           in a direction that it chooses; there is a tendency by default  for  it
           to  digitise  upwards  on  the  photochromic  screen  by default.  Once
           line-following has commenced, it will continue until such time  as  the
           end  of  line  is reached or operator intervention or help is required.
           In both cases, Laseraid will enter HELP mode for an  operator  decision
           to be made (see section 10.4).

                There is a particularly useful facility  when  'FIN'  is  selected
           which  eases  considerably some line digitising such as contours.  This
           facility involves the automatic connection  of  lines  that  have  been
           digitised  in two halves in opposite directions.  To use this facility,
           operators should not commence digitising  the  line  feature  by  first
           directing the laser cursor to the features start.  Instead, they should
           choose some point in the centre of the feature's course.  In this  way,
           once  the  line  type  has  been  registered  Laseraid  will  begin  to
           line-follow one half of  the  line  feature  in  a  direction  that  it
           chooses.   Once  this  half is completed, accepted and painted-out, the
           cursor will automatically find the other half of the line and  digitise
           it  too  in  the  opposite direction again after its line type has been
           established again with either STR (FB1), CUR (FB2),  RAN  (FB3).   Once
           both  halves of the feature have been digitised in opposite directions,
           the system automatically reverses the digitising of one of  the  halves
           and  connects  it  to  the  other  half  to produce a simple, connected
           digitised line as though it had been digitised in  one  direction  from
           start  to  finish  in the first place.  The overriding benefit of using
           this technique for digitising is that the line-following is assured  of
           scanning  right  to the end of lines; which is not necessarily the case
           when relying on the operator to position the cursor  manually  at  line
           ends.

                De-selection of 'FIN' is achieved by depressing again FB10  whilst
           in  main  mode  and  confirmation  is given by the extinguishing of the
           function button light.

                The action of depressing FB11 is to issue the 'SQR' command  which
           will 'flag' or mark every feature that is digitised subsequently in the
           IFF file for squaring by post-hoc processing  software  (see  LAPROCESS
           User's  Guide).  Features are not squared immediately by Laseraid, they
           are merely flagged to be squared later.  The selection of 'SQR' on FB11
           is  confirmed  by  the  illumination  of  FB11.   It  is de-selected by

           depressing FB11 again whilst in main mode, at which time  the  button's
           illumination  is  seen to extinguish.  All features which are digitised

                The 'REV' option is selected via FB12 whilst in main mode  and  is
           confirmed by the illumination of FB12.  Its action is to force the next
           feature only which is to be digitised to be reversed  if  necessary  to
           ensure  that  its  coordinates  run  clockwise.  It is only operable on
           closed loop features and then only if they are digitised anticlockwise.
           Its  action is to ensure that all closed loop features are digitised in
           the same direction.  'REV' is only operable for the  feature  which  is
           digitised  immediately  after the option has been selected.  As soon as
           this feature has been captured and accepted the option  is  de-selected
           automatically.   'REV'  can  be selected repeatedly by re-pressing FB12
           before each feature is digitised if there are a number of  lines  which
           require  to  be  reversed.   Once  selected,  the  'REV'  option can be
           cancelled with 'ABA' (FB16) prior to the feature being digitised.

                Under  normal  circumstances,  the   Lasertrak   is   continuously
           searching  for closed features.  As soon as it reaches a location along
           a line being digitised which equals the start position  of  that  line,
           Lasertrak  will  halt  and report in help mode that the end of a closed
           loop feature has been reached.  This facility can  be  turned-off  with
           the  'OPE'  command  (FB13) in main mode.  Confirmation is given by the
           illumination of  FB13  and  the  option  remains  active  until  it  is
           de-selected by again depressing FB13.

                Care is necessary in its use.  Attempts to digitise a loop feature
           with  'OPE'  selected as operative will mean that the Lasertrak will no
           longer know the location of the features  end-point  and  it  will,  in
           fact,  cycle  repeatedly  until  such  a  time  as  the  operator halts
           line-following manually.

                The 'INC' and 'DEC' commands are  used  in  conjunction  with  the
           keyboard commands 'MNF' and 'MHT' and their function depends on whether
           Laseraid is running in feature mode (see  10.2.1)  or  elevation  -  or
           height - mode (see 10.2.2).

                On depressing either 'DEC' (FB14) or 'INC' (FB15)  (repeatedly  if
           desired)  whilst  in  main mode the action is to decrement or increment
           the coding (feature serial number or feature  elevation  code)  by  the
           interval  defined  by  the keyboard commands MNF or MHT.  In Laseraid's
           normal (or feature) mode, 'MNF' is used  and  DEC/INC  operate  on  the
           feature serial numbers (NF entries in IFF).  In Laseraid elevation mode
           (which is established by the keywords 'HTD' or 'HTI'  on  the  invoking
           command  line  - see section 8.2), 'MHT' is used and DEC/INC operate on
           the feature elevation coding (AC entries in IFF).

                As usual, 'ABA' is the panic, error exit command available at  all
           times  on  FB16.   Its  effect  is  to  cancel any previous operations:
           repeated use also centres the laser cursor on the photochromic  display
           screen.


       This completes the commands available from function buttons  in  main-mode.

                Paragraph  (b)  in  section  (10.3)  describes   the   nature   of
           re-paint-out  in  Lasertrak.  By its nature, total paint-out of a large
           map image can be a lengthy process and hence in many  instances  it  is
           appropriate  to  re-paint-out  only  those  lines  which  fall  with  a
           localised rectangular space.  This  is  possible  with  the  main  mode
           keyboard command 'WIN'.

                The use of 'WIN' is achieved by typing it as a prefix to the 'FOR'
           (forward  paint-out)  or  'REP'  (re-paint-out)  command  (see  item b,
           above).  The commands are typed on the same line and  separated  by  at
           least  one  space.   Up to seven layers may be selected at any one time
           for paint out.  By issuing the following command:

                           WIN   FOR n1 - n6     <carriage return>

           Laseraid will enter 'window paint-out' mode which is confirmed  by  the
           function button pattern of lights as detailed below.

                FB16  -   'ABA'   -   abandon window re-paintout mode 

           The operator should then define the limit of the re-paint window;  this
           is  done  with  the  laser cursor and the trackerball.  First the lower
           left limits (South West corner) of the required window is visited  with
           the  laser  cursor.   Then, careful movement towards the upper-right of
           window (North East corner) is performed with the window being displayed
           with  the  red laser in refresh on the photochromic screen.  Successful
           confirmation and acceptance of the window definition is  achieved  with
           FB4  to  issue  the 'OK' command.  The Lasertrak will then re-paint out
           all lines which have been digitised within the defined window.  The two
           alternatives to the use of 'OK' (FB4) could have been (FB1) to redefine
           the window's location again and cancelling the previous  definition  or
           'ABA'  (FB16)  to  abandon window repaint altogether and return to main
           mode.

                It is suggested that most edit operations on digitised  files  are
           best   performed  on  bona-fide  editing  work  stations  such  as  the
           Laser-Scan LITES  system.   However,  some  simple  operations  can  be
           performed  on  existing  digitised  lines within Laseraid, though these
           operations can be slow and are restricted either to total  deletion  or
           to  re-paint-out.   These  two  functions  are  defined  by appropriate
           function buttons as described below.

                Entry into Laseraid's simple editing mode  is  achieved  from  the
           close-up screen keyboard with the command

           Before depressing <carriage return> the operator will have pointed  the
           laser  cursor  to  the  vicinity  of  the desired feature for edit.  If
           Laseraid is unable to find the requested feature (and the search  could

           detection is successful, the feature found will be refreshed in red  on
           the photochromic display and LOCATE mode will be entered - confirmed by
           the function button pattern of lights as shown below:

                The action of the keyboard command  'TIM'  is  to  detail  on  the
           close-up screen a summary of the system timings to-date.  The following
           break-down is used when summarising system times:
                - INITIALISING       -     time spent invoking 
                                           Laseraid and reading
                                           in the system parameter 
                                           (or patch) files
                - MAIN MODE          -     time spent obeying main 
                                           mode commands
                - HELP MODE          -     time spent obeying help 
                                           mode commands
                - FOLLOWING          -     time spent in automatic 
                                           line-following
                - POINT MODE         -     time spent digitising 
                                           point features
                - PAINTING OUT       -     time spent on paint-out
                - CALIBRATION        -     time spent on CP and 
                                           CHK mode
                - IDLE TIME          -     time spent idle awaiting 
                                           operator decision
                - GRAND TOTAL        -     sum total of all above

           Using the command 'ZTI' will artificially reset all timers to zero  and
           the  clock  will  commence  counting  from this point on.  All items of
           timing are zeroed by ZTI except the TOTAL item which remains unchanged.
           Initially,  ZTI  is run automatically on each occasion that Laseraid is
           invoked.

                The action of the keyboard command 'ZIJ' is to clear  all  entries
           in  the  current junction list.  This will cause 'GNF' (FB8) to have no
           effect and this situation will continue throughout the  time  that  the
           junction  list  is  empty.   The junction list will begin to re-fill as
           more junctions are recognised from subsequent digitising.  All junction
           entries  which  are  removed from the list by 'ZIJ' cannot be recreated
           during the current digitising session.  It is possible to reconstruct a
           list  by terminating Laseraid with 'EOS' and re-starting it again; this
           action provides a junction list in the form that it appeared  prior  to
           the original 'ZIJ' being issued.

                The action of this command is to move the photochromic film on  to

           The command is entered from the close-up  keyboard  and  can  take  two
           forms, viz

                The first option is to scroll by  the  default  number  of  frames
           (which is one frame only).  The second option is to scroll by a defined
           number of frames supplied in the argument r.  It should be pointed  out
           that  once  the photochromic film has been moved to a new frame (either
           by PCF or by  the  Main  control  panel  switch)  it  is  necessary  to
           remeasure  the  control points in Measure mode to re-register the paint
           out data with the digitised map data.

                Whilst digitising both in line following or edge following  modes,
           features  can  be  abandoned before they have been accepted in the help
           mode by the command 'ABA' (FB16).  Once accepted, though, each  feature
           is  stored in the IFF file and can only be cancelled either by [3mpost-hoc[0m
           editing, by the LOCate option (see item n  above)  or  by  the  command
           'CAN'.   The  'CAN' command is issued in Laseraid main mode and deletes
           the immediate previous line to be digitised and accepted.  It  is  only
           operable  if  no  attempt has been made to commence digitising the next

                Para (a) in this section has  described  the  association  between
           line-type  and  feature  coding  and six function buttons in main mode.
           These feature codes  and  line  types  are  set  appropriately  by  the
           operator  and  this  information  is  stored  in  the  system's current
           parameter file for use in future digitising sessions.   Paragraphs  (w)
           and  (x)  below explain how the feature codes and line types associated
           with the function buttons can be modified.


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 72


                The keyboard command 'PFB' enables the operator to determine  what
           the  current settings for line types and feature codes are with respect
           to the six line type buttons:   FB1,  FB2,  FB3,  FB5,  FB6,  FB7.   On
           issuing  the  command 'PFB' from the close-up keyboard a summary report
           of the current settings is displayed on the close-up screen.  A typical
           example is shown below:

                             FC:        1     2     3     -
                                        5     6    30     -

                             TYPE:      5     3     4     -
                                        2     2     1     -


                This report can be interpreted in  the  following  way.   'FC'  is
           Laser-Scan's  IFF  entry  for  interpolation  or  feature  code.  Thus,
           currently FB1 has  feature  code  1,  FB7  has  feature  code  30  etc.
           Similarly,  line type 5 (in Laseraid's current parameter file - see the
           Lasertrak Reference Manual) is associated with FB1, and line type 2  is
           associated  with FB5, FB6.  Confirmation of changes is equally possible
           with 'PFB'.

                Readers are referred initially to para (v) above.  The FCF command
           enables  operators to modify the feature codes associated with the line
           type function buttons FB1, FB2, FB3, FB5, FB6,  FB7.   The  command  is
           typed  whilst  in  main  mode  from the close-up keyboard and takes two
           numeric arguments (separated by spaces).  The first argument, n, refers
           to the function button number to be changed; it can only take either of
           the values 1,2,3,5,6,7.  The second  argument,  m,  refers  to  the  FC
           (feature  code)  to  be  set and should be an integer in the range 0 to
           32767.

                Readers are referred initially to the  previous  paragraphs.   The
           TYF  command enables operators to modify the line types associated with
           line type function buttons.  Line types are defined within the  current
           Laseraid  parameter  (or  patch)  files  and  exist  as a collection of
           special scan parameter settings within a table of values.  Each  column
           in the table (known as the "type-tables ") refers to a type of line and
           these are limited to seven columns and hence  seven  line  types.   The
           Lasertrak  Reference  Manual  gives more details on line types and scan
           parameter tuning.  TYF if typed whilst in main mode from  the  close-up
           screen  keyboard and takes two numeric arguments (separated by spaces).
           The first argument, n, refers to  the  function  button  number  to  be
           changed; it can only take either of the values 1,2,3,5,6,7.  The second
           argument, m, refers to the line  type  corresponding  to  the  relevant
           column   in  the  type  tables;  it  takes  the  value  1-6  inclusive.
           Confirmation of the change is possible with 'PFB' - see above.

  10.4  [3mHELP[0m [3mMODE[0m

       This section describes the nature of help mode.  This is the software level
  which  is  always  available  for  operator  assistance  and intervention whilst
  automatic line-following is taking place.  It is also the level  which  Laseraid
  will enter when it stops itself to request the help of the operator.  Thus, help
  mode provides stage 3 of the Lasertrak digitising cycle  (as  was  described  in
  section 10.1); it is here where lines are digitised, verified and accepted.

       Confirmation that  Laseraid  has  entered  help  mode  is  given  with  the
  following pattern of function button lights.

                     ----- ----- ----- -----



       Help mode is entered initially before auto-line following begins but  after
  line-type  selection  has been made for each line to be digitised (see 10.3.1a).
  Once the operator has selected his desired line to be digitised  and  registered
  its type from main mode, the system enters help mode immediately to seek further
  assistance for the automatic line following.  This situation  assumes  that  the
  main  mode command option 'FIN' is not operative at the time (see section 10.3.1
  para (g)).  Help mode is also entered after a line following pause due either to
  operator or software intervention.

       The commands available in help mode, as usual are given  by  both  function
  buttons  and  the  close-up  keyboard:   the most widely used being available on
  function buttons with the remainder available from the close-up keyboard.   Help
  mode commands are described below.

                This facility  is  used  in  association  with  the  laser  cursor

           direction determined by  the  tramlines.   If  the  tramlines  are  not
           present  on  the  screen,  then  ONE  command  will produce them on the
           screen.  Once a single scan has been performed,  line-following  pauses
           once again in help mode and displays in red refresh on the photochromic
           screen the portion of the line detected.

                The use of the ONE command on all  occasions  is  very  useful  in
           confirming  to the operator that line-following would perform correctly
           if it were allowed to proceed automatically.  It provides the  operator
           with 'peace-of-mind'.

                Depressing FB4 in help mode issues the 'GO' command; this  is  the
           Laseraid  instruction  to commence automatic line-following and attempt
           to digitise the current feature easily and efficiently.  Automatic line
           following  is seen on the photochromic screen as a sequential series of
           single scans (with no pause in between each).  The scans should be seen
           to track along the current line being digitised with little or no delay
           in progression along the line.

                Whilst automatic line-following is  taking  place,  operators  are
           advised to monitor its progress visually and intervene on the following
           occasion.

          (i)  when the software pauses line-following automatically because it is
               confused:  typical actions might be


                    -  'GO'    (FB4)    try line-following again
                    -  'ONE'   (FB3)    try single-scan to "generate" 
                                        tram-lines and hence gives 
                                        direction assistance
                    -  'NXT'   (FB8)    show and select alternate 
                                        routes available
                    -  'HOP'   (FB11)   jump over confused area


         (ii)  when the software pauses  because  the  end  of  feature  has  been
               reached

                    -  'END'   (FB12)   accept feature and return 
                                        to main mode

        (iii)  when line-following is seen to make a mistake

                    -  'BB'    (FB15)   pause line-following. A 
                                        second press of FB15 enters 
                                        Laseraid into a rolling 
                                        mode where the tracker ball 
                                        can be used to 'wind back'
                                        to the problem area in order 
                                        to re-scan. A full explanation
                                        of 'rolling mode' is in para h

                The NeXT command on FB8 is useful in particularly complex areas of
           maps  to  be digitised where there are several alternate paths or lines
           to follow in close proximity.  The action of 'NXT' is to display to the
           operator  (as short portions of line in red refresh on the photochromic
           screen) all path options available  for  line-following  at  the  laser
           cursor's  current  position.   Repeated  pressing of 'NXT' (FB8) cycles
           repeatedly through the path options.  Once the desired path is selected
           operators can attempt further line-following with either 'ONE' (FB3) or
           'GO' (FB4).

                When junction recognition is operative the command 'NXT' (FB8) has
           an  enhanced  use  since  it is able to select and display to operators
           (with red refresh on the photochromic screen) all  directions  detected
           which  enter  and  exit the current junction position.  This provides a
           fast and flexible method to direct the line-following through a network
           of  lines;  in  most  cases, it obviates the use of the trackerball and
           tramlines and is particularly useful  when  used  in  conjunction  with
           'GNF' (FB8) in main mode.  The proviso for the use of 'NXT' in this way
           is that junctions must first have been scanned  and  recognised  before
           'NXT'  becomes operative.  Further, it is of no use when a junction has
           been fixed manually with 'MAJ' .   In  such  situations,  there  is  no
           information  in  the junction list of the directions of entrant lines -
           NXT needs this information and it can only be achieved when a  junction
           has been scanned and recognised automatically.

                If the operator wishes to stop the automatic scanning at the  next
           junction in order to change the direction of the scan using 'NXT', then
           FB15 is depressed once the junction has  been  accepted.   The  default
           wait  between  junction  acceptance  and  continuation  is  set  at 0.2
           seconds.

                Continuous depressing of 'NXT' in help mode at junction  positions
           cycles  repeatedly  through  all the entrant/exit lines which have been
           detected.  Once the appropriate exit has been chosen, the 'GO'  command
           on FB4 will restart auto line-following.

                The 'MP' command on FB10 provides the operator  with  a  means  to
           force a digitised point to be fixed at specific, defined locations.  It
           is useful, for example, to include  digitised  points  manually  across
           connections over large gaps in a digitised source line.  Operators need
           merely position the laser cursor over the desired  point  location  and
           depress  FB10  to  issue the 'MP' command.  Points may be registered by
           subsequent pressing of FB10.  Master points  are  equally  able  to  be
           created  manually  on  the  close-up  screen  with the keyboard command
           'CLO'.  The operator should direct the laser cursor to vicinity of  the
           desired point location and type on the keyboard:

                                 [1mCLO[0m      <carriage return>

                The action is for the close-up screen to show a  greatly  enlarged
           impression  of  the  source  document from which an accurate fix can be
           made with the close-up screen's cursor.  Readers are referred  to  para
           (k) in this section for details of CLOse-up digitising of points.  Once

           the laser cursor is positioned accurately, use of FB10 will create  the
           Master Point in that location.

                Several Master Points may be created using the close-up screen  by
           typing at the keyboard the command:

                                 MAN      <carriage return>

                This action again produces a close-up view on the close-up screen,
           but  this time each press of the space bar creates a Master Point, from
           the close-up keyboard as the cursor's location on the close-up  screen.

                                              E

           [3mlinework[0m

                The HOP command on FB11 is used on occasions where it is  required
           to  ignore certain areas of the source document.  Typical regions to be
           ignored could be unrequired symbols (such as  markers  along  a  line's
           course  or  elevation  details on contours) or they could comprise poor
           portions  of  line  work  which  the  scanner  is  unable   to   detect
           successfully    by   automatic   line-following.    In   either   event
           line-following will have been paused (perhaps by operator  intervention
           FB15  or  by  software request for help) and the system will be in help
           mode.

                The 'HOP' command is invoked by depressing FB11 and the tram lines
           are  seen  on  the  photochromic  display.   The trackerball is used to
           re-position the laser cursor  (in  this  case  the  tramlines)  to  the
           desired new location from which automatic line-following can recommence
           and this can be re-started with either 'ONE' (FB3) or 'GO' (FB4).   The
           former  option is desirable initially to confirm that the Lasertrak has
           re-detected  the  correct  line  before  automatic  line-following   is
           released with 'GO' (FB4).

                Once the end of a feature has been reached - it could  be  because
           there  is  no more line to follow, or because a loop feature has closed
           or due to an operator pause instruction - it is necessary to accept the
           feature before it is stored in the output IFF file and the next feature
           can be started.

                At this stage, the  operator  can  either  accept  or  reject  the
           feature:   he  will  have monitored line-following progress and will be
           able to see the current buffer of digitised coordinates in red  refresh
           on the photochromic display.  The feature is rejected with 'ABA' (FB16)
           - see (i) below.  The feature is accepted with 'END' (FB12).   As  soon
           as  the 'END' command is issued the feature is stored in the output IFF
           file and it is painted out from the photochromic display (if the  Paint
           Out  Suppress  'POS'  option  is  not  operative from main mode (FB9)).
           Control immediately returns to  Laseraid  main  mode  and  the  feature
           serial numbers (and elevation ancillary codes, if relevant) are updated

           if the ANF (and AHT) commands are set appropriately (see section 10.2.1
           and 10.2.2).

                Once a feature has been accepted with 'END', it can no  longer  be
           rejected  easily  and such operations are best left to [3mpost-hoc[0m editing
           processes.  Users are referred to  the  main-mode  command  'CAN'  (via
           keyboard  only)  in  which  the  latest feature accepted can be deleted
           immediately - though this is only possible if no attempt has been  made
           to start digitising the next feature (see section 10.3.2).

                During operator intervention phases of Lasertrak  digitising,  the
           cursor   takes   on  two  states  of  appearance  or  "movements"  from
           trackerball.  One state  is  the  movement  of  the  cursor's  physical
           position;  this  is  possible  when  it  is  a  'cross' and can also be
           possible (for example with the 'HOP' command - see item (e) above) when
           it  is the 'tram-lines' symbol.  The second state is only possible with
           the tram-lines cursor and this is the facility  where  the  trackerball
           can  be  used  to  rotate  the  cursor's  angle  with its base position
           anchored in a fixed screen location.

                The 'MOV' command available on FB14 in  help  mode  instructs  the
           laser cursor to flip cyclically between each state of operation - angle
           and position.  The facility is useful when operators wish to pass  over
           poor  line  work  or  chain  on  to other lines.  It is very similar in
           concept to the 'HOP' command but does not fix master points  on  either
           side of the gaps being jumped.  If the 'MOVE' command was to be used in
           a similar way to 'HOP' it would be necessary to include  master  points
           where appropriate with the command 'MP' on FB10.

                FB15 has two important functions during  the  digitising  process.
           Firstly,  it  provides  the  operator with an option to pause automatic
           line-following which will have been started originally with the command
           'GO'  on  FB4.  This line-following interrupt stops auto-digitising and
           the red laser displays in  refresh  on  the  photochromic  display  the
           current  'buffer'  of  digitised  coordinates.   The  operator can then
           re-start auto-digitising again with 'GO' (FB4) or he can intervene with
           other  options  such  as 'HOP' (FB11), 'ONE' (FB3), 'END' (FB12), 'ABA'
           (FB16).  Secondly, he can backtrack along the line digitised  thus  far
           to possible sources of error.

                The rolling mode can be obtained  by  pressing  BB  (FB15)  for  a
           second  time.   This  will enable the tracker ball and redefine FB15 to
           become BAC which will enable  the  operator  to  delete  master  points
           individually  with each consequent press of FB15.  The tracker ball can
           also be used to back track along the digitised line -  deleting  master
           points on the way.

                Simultaneously, when rolling mode is  entered  (by  pressing  FB15
           twice)  function  button  8  (FB8)  is  also  redefined as LJN - Locate
           previous JunctioN.  This is only relevant if the operator is digitising
           using a line type which has enabled junction recognition.  Once rolling


  INTRODUCTORY GUIDE TO DIGITISING WITH LASERTRAK                          Page 79


           mode  has  been  entered,  the  operator  is  able  to  roll  back  the
           trackerball  to  the  previous junction.  Depressing 'LJN' (FB8) within
           the tolerance of the search scan redefines FB8  to  become  'NXT'  thus
           enabling the operator to chose a different arm to scan along.  FB4 will
           restart the line following.

                The 'ABA' command on FB16 is the usual panic option in help  mode.
           It  is  only operable when auto-line following is paused and its effect
           is to cancel all digitised achieved to-date on the current feature  and
           return  to main mode.  Thus it provides a reject option for a digitised
           line (as opposed to accept with 'END' (FB12)).   Rejection  of  a  line
           feature  or abandoning help mode for some other reason in this way does
           not increment feature serial numbers (or elevation codes  if  relevant)
           and  tram-line cursors are returned to the 'cross' symbol in main mode.
           'ABA' will not work whilst line-following is active; it must  first  be
           paused with 'BB' on FB15.

       This facility is included  in  this  introductory  guide  under  help  mode
  commands  for  convenience, though strictly speaking it is a [3mmacro[0m rather than a
  [3mcommand[0m.  The concept of Laseraid macros is not  discussed  in  detail  in  this
  document.  Briefly a macro is a user-defined sequence of Laseraid basic commands
  held under an assumed macro name.  On supplying an  instruction  to  invoke  the
  macro  -  which  is  achieved  by  supplying  its assumed name - the sequence of
  commands are run in turn automatically.

       The macro 'B' is an example of such a sequence of  commands;  to  a  novice
  operator,  there  need be no distinctions made between commands and macros.  The
  function of the macro 'B' for all versions of Laseraid help mode is  to  display
  on  the  close-up  screen  the  vector  representation of the previous buffer of
  digitised line-work.  The position of fixed master points is also shown  on  the
  display as crosses.  The facility is useful for operator's to confirm successful
  digitising before a  feature  is  accepted  with  'END'  (FB12).   'B'  is  only
  available from the close-up keyboard and line-following must have been paused by

  either operator or software intervention.

       This facility is particularly useful when wishing to register  the  cursors
  location  very  accurately - perhaps to digitise Master Points (MP-FB10).  Under
  normal circumstances, the positioning of the laser cursor is only as good as can
  be determined by the operator's visual inspection of the photochromic screen and
  his movement of the trackerball.  The keyboard command 'CLO' provides a means of
  more  accurate  cursor  positioning.   Operator's  first  direct  the laser with
  trackerball to the vicinity of the required position.  The command 'CLO' is then
  issued  from  the  close-up  keyboard  which instructs the Lasertrak to scan the
  vicinity of cursor position and show a facsimile of what has been  seen  on  the
  close-up  screen.   Accurate  cursor  positioning  is  then possible by means of
  adjusting the  close-up  cursor  to  the  required  location  and  pressing  the
  space-bar.   This  action  moves the laser cursor to the correct position on the
  photochromic screen.

       Several Master Points may be created using the close-up terminal by  typing
  the  command  'MAN'  at  the  keyboard.   Laseraid  must  be  in  help  mode and
  line-following should be paused.  The action  of  the  command  MANual  draws  a
  close-up  facsimile on the close-up screen.  The close-up cursor can then assign
  accurately the required Master Point locations and each time the  space  bar  is
  depressed,  a  Master  Point is created.  The command 'E' from the keyboard ends
  the sequence.  The combination of inserting  manual  master  points  and  manual
  junctions is described in the following section.

       There may be instances when operators require to force a  junction  feature
  in  locations  where laseraid cannot define one for itself automatically.  Usual
  reasons are from the effects of poor-quality line-work, short gaps  or  dirt  at
  the junction position or inappropriate Lasertrak tuning.

       Manual definition of a junction can be performed in two ways at present and
  though both involve the use of several commands, it is the command

                                       [1mMAJ[0m [1mn[0m

  which is fundamental to the junction creation process.  MAJ takes  one  argument
  which  is  numeric  and  this represents the number of lines (or arms) which are
  entrant to the junction being created.  A 'T' junction, for example,  has  three
  entrant lines and hence it is created with the command

                                       [1mMAJ[0m [1m3[0m

  'MAJ' can only be entered from the close-up  keyboard  and  line-following  must
  have been paused with the system in help mode.

       There are two ways in which manual junctions can be created - one  involves
  the  use  of  the  laser cursor on the photochromic screen and the second is for
  very accurate positioning involving the close-up screen.   Both  procedures  are
  described in steps below.

          (i)  Position the laser  cursor  over  the  required  location  for  the
               junction   point  position  as  accurately  as  possible  with  the
               trackerball,

         (ii)  enter master point mode by pressing FB10.  Create a master point at
               that location by issuing a 'MP' command on FB10.

        (iii)  convert the master point from (ii) above into a junction  point  of
               known number of entrant lines by typing at the close-up keyboard

               where n is the determined number of entrant lines.

         (iv)  a junction point at the cursor's location will  have  been  created
               and an entry made in the junction list.

          (i)  If an automatic scan is unsuccessful, then it may be  necessary  to
               generate a manual junction.

         (ii)  ask for a close-up facsimile of the vicinity of the laser cursor to
               be drawn on the close-up screen.  This is achieved by typing at the
               close-up keyboard

                                   [1mMAN[0m      <carriage return>

               The result is a  close-up  facsimile  and  the  appearance  of  the
               close-up screen cursor.

        (iii)  using the 'joy  stick'  on  the  close-up  terminal,  position  the
               close-up  cursor  over the exact position where the manual junction
               is required.

         (iv)  using the keyboard space bar, the junction can be placed  and  then
               the  letter 'E' to end the junction point.  Since only one point is
               to be fixed, it can be typed immediately.   The  alternative  could
               have  been  to  create  several  points  - these would be done by a
               combination of the close-up cursor and the keyboard space bar.  The
               sequence  of  points  created,  though, should always be terminated
               with 'E'.

          (v)  convert the Master Point that has been created into a junction with
               the keyboard command

               where n represents a numeric  argument  to  define  the  determined
               number of entrant lines

         (vi)  the junction has now been created and it will have an entry in  the
               junction list.

                In both methods for manual junction creation, there are  a  number
           of conditions and disadvantages, viz:

                -   'NXT' (FB8) has no effect because manual junctions 
                   have no details on the direction of entrant lines.

                -   once all lines entrant to the manual junction have 
                   been digitised, it will not be deleted from the 
                   junction list.  It remains there forever, or until 
                   the total list is cleared with 'ZIJ'.

                -   digitising of lines which exit the manual junction 
                   is achieved by 'ONE' (FB3) to determine direction 
                   with the tram-lines and 'GO' (FB4) to commence 
                   auto-line-following.

                -   when a manual junction is encountered by Laseraid,
                   the message 'Manual junction' appears on the close-up
                   screen and tramlines will be produced. The direction
                   of line following can be chosen with the tracker ball
                   and line following resumed with FB4

       The LAPROCESS post-processing program is a utility supplied  by  Laser-Scan
  which  must be applied to all data digitised using Laseraid before that data can
  be edited, plotted or otherwise manipulated.  It is invoked by the command:

                     [1mLAPROCESS[0m input-filename  output-filename

  in response to the VMS prompt.  The program has several powerful functions :

       1.  Transformation of the coordinate  data  into  the  target  'map'  space
           specified in the control point setup stage.  (Section 9.6)

       2.  Unification of two part features created using the FIND option  set  in
           main mode (Section 10.3)

       3.  Ordering of closed features if they were tagged with the reverse option
           (Section 10.3)


  To run this utility, operators must  first  ensure  that  the  target  IFF  file
  directory has been established by the command 'SI' (see section 7.2).


       The full specification of LAPROCESS can be  found  in  the  LAPROCESS  User
  Guide.

  12  [3mSYSTEM[0m [3mHARDWARE[0m [3mPOWER-DOWN[0m [3mPROCEDURES[0m

       The instructions which follow explain the procedures  necessary  to  power-
  down  the  Lasertrak hardware; they assume that the system is currently switched
  on with power being supplied to the projection system, the lasers and the  water
  cooling  unit.  It is recommended that at most the Lasertrak only be switched on
  and off once  per  day.   It  is  not  necessary  (indeed  not  recommended)  to
  power-down  the hardware each time it is not required for use.  Lasertrak should
  only be powered-down at the end of a day's session.

       The procedure to power-down Lasertrak involves following a series of  steps
  in sequence as are described below.

      (a)  Switch the Lasertrak to disable off-line  by  positioning  the  machine
           STATUS switch on the main control panel ([1mB[0m11) to the disable position.

      (b)  Depress  green  master  on/off  button  to  power-down   the   machine:
           confirmation is given by the extinguishing of this power light ([1mB[0m10).

      (c)  Turn anti-clockwise to  vertical  the  master  power-lock  key  on  the
           Lasertrak main panel ([1mB[0m9).

      (d)  Switch off water supply for the laser cooling system.


       The Lasertrak is now powered-down confirmed by  the  extinguishing  of  all
  lights  and the darkness of the photochromic screen ([1mA[0m2).  The Lasertrak can now
  be left in this state with confidence until it is required again, at which  time
  the hardware should be powered-up in the normal way (see section 5).
