  1  [3mGeneral[0m [3mDescription[0m

  LASERAID is the interactive data capture program for  the  Laser-Scan  LASERTRAK
  automatic  digitiser.   Features  are  selected  and  digitised from a graphical
  source, typically a map or drawing.  LASERAID produces a digital  representation
  of  the  source  in  a  file  containing the description and coordinates of each
  feature.

  LASERAID digitises points, lines and areas  quickly  and  accurately  using  the
  LASERTRAK  scanning  hardware.   It  will also identify and capture junctions in
  linework automatically, creating 'link-node' structured output files.

  Features  are  selected  and  coded  either  by  the  operator,  or  by  digital
  pre-guidance  data.   All  digitising operations are under operator control, and
  the progress and results of data capture are continuously  displayed  to  ensure
  correctness and completeness of the output data.



  2  [3mInput[0m

  The input to LASERAID is a 100mm * 70mm monochrome photographic  negative  (dark
  background)  usually at a reduction of about 1:5.  Line widths should be no less
  than  30  microns  on  the  negative.   Junctions  which  are  to  be   measured
  automatically must be formed with solid linework.

  Digital pre-guidance data is provided in an IFF file (see below).



  3  [3mOutput[0m [3mData[0m

  LASERAID produces a Laser-Scan Internal Feature Format (IFF) file on disc.   IFF
  is  Laser-Scan's  standard  format  for  cartographic  data storage, and is used
  extensively by other Laser-Scan software products.  It  is  capable  of  holding
  large  quantities  of  data efficiently, and the only limits on feature size and
  number of features are those imposed by the maximum file size (30 megabytes) and
  by  the capacity of processing programs.  Externally, IFF files are standard DEC
  Files-11 structure and hence can be written to magnetic  tape  for  transfer  or
  storage using standard DEC utilities.



  4  [3mOperation[0m

  LASERAID is run at a LASERTRAK automatic digitiser.  A large (1000mm.  x  700mm)
  screen  displays  the  source  graphic  and the digitising operations.  A colour
  graphics terminal provides high magnification views of  the  scanned  data,  and
  displays status and confirmatory messages.

  The operator controls the data capture primarily  using  the  tracker  ball  and
  function  buttons  of  the LASERTRAK.  Additional commands are entered using the
  keyboard of the graphics terminal.

  5.1  [3mDigitising[0m [3mcapabilities[0m

  LASERAID will digitise:

        -  line features, including broken lines, by  following.   The  centreline
           coordinates are recorded.

        -  junctions  in  solid  linework,  while  following   the   lines.    The
           intersection  point  and  the  arms  are  recorded.   The incoming line
           features record the presence of  the  junction,  thereby  completing  a
           link-node structure.

        -  area features, by following their edges.  The outline is recorded.

        -  point features depicted as  dots,  small  circles,  crosses  or  filled
           squares.   The  centre  point  (and  an  orientation  for  squares)  is
           recorded.

        -  control points, fiducials and  grids.   The  coordinates  are  used  as
           registration information.

  Features less than about 1mm square on the negative can be captured in a  single
  scan, unless they contain junctions.

  LASERAID also provides mechanisms for  the  operator  to  interpret  missing  or
  corrupt  graphics by manual construction of features, using the LASERTRAK screen
  or the graphics terminal to input coordinate data.



  5.2  [3mFeature[0m [3mselection[0m

  Features are selected for digitising by:

        -  manual cursor pointing.  The operator selects the  features  using  the
           LASERTRAK screen.

        -  use  of  digital  pre-guidance  data.   An  IFF  file  containing   the
           coordinates  of  a point on each feature and information about the type
           of feature may be created either on a LASERTRAK or a  digitising  table
           and used to reduce the amount of operator action during digitisation.

        -  automatic digitising of unmeasured junction arms.   If  a  pre-guidance
           file  is  not  used, the junction list may be used to select unmeasured
           linework.

  In the first two cases,  an  automatic  'search-and-capture'  procedure  may  be
  invoked to reduce the positioning accuracy required.

  5.3  [3mFeature[0m [3mcoding[0m

  Each feature may be coded with the following information:

        -  a feature  number.   This  may  be  input  from  the  keyboard  for  an
           individual  feature,  or  may  be  that of the previous feature plus or
           minus a (possibly zero) step.  Each feature is also assigned an  unique
           sequence number.

        -  a primary feature code.  This code is determined by the function button
           pressed to start digitising.

        -  multiple ancillary codes.  Any further attributes may be added,  and  a
           fixed code may be added to all features if desired.

        -  height values (eg of contours).  The current value is displayed to  the
           operator,  and  may  be  incremented  or  decremented  automatically or
           manually.

  The IFF output file is divided into layers,  generally  separating  features  of
  different natures.  Any feature has an associated layer.



  5.4  [3mFeature[0m [3mcapture[0m


        -  LASERAID automatically follows lines  and  edges,  and  determines  the
           locations  of  points  and  junctions.   The operator can stop the data
           capture process and force the digitiser to take a particular path if it
           sees  ambiguous  data, thus practically eliminating the need to correct
           the data after it has been captured.  The program will stop if the  end
           of feature is encountered, or if operator guidance is required.

        -  Whenever the operator intervenes or the  program  pauses  for  operator
           intervention  the  last few centimetres of line digitised are displayed
           in red refresh superimposed on the image of the map on  the  screen  of
           the LASERTRAK.

        -  After each feature  has  been  captured  it  is  drawn  on  the  orange
           photochromic  film  sandwiched  against the negative.  This reduces its
           visibility to both  the  operator  and  the  machine.   The  'paintout'
           mechanism  enables  the  operator  to  check  on  the  accuracy  of the
           digitisation, as well as providing a  simple  and  effective  means  of
           identifying those features yet to be digitised.

        -  A feature may be abandoned at any time and incorrect  features  may  be
           selected for deletion by positioning the cursor close to them.

        -  The operator does not have to do any accurate positioning or keep track
           of features digitised.

        -  A session may be stopped at any  time,  and  then  restarted  with  the
           previously digitised features being painted out.

  5.5  [3mCapturing[0m [3mjunctions[0m


        -  On measurement of a junction,  which  may  be  at  any  position  in  a
           feature, the intersection point and the number of arms are displayed in
           refresh.   The  feature  may  be  terminated  at   the   junction,   or
           line-following  may  proceed along one of the arms.  The program offers
           an out-going arm based on a  user-specified  criterion:   either  left,
           right  or  straight  ahead,  and  will optionally resume line following
           automatically on this basis.  The operator may, however, interrupt this
           process  at  any  time  and select any arm to continue digitising.  The
           junction may be disregarded entirely if not required.

        -  A list of previously measured junctions is maintained  to  enhance  the
           speed  of the digitising procedure.  On returning to one such junction,
           the outgoing arm is selected from those known not to have been measured
           yet  (although  the  operator may override this).  If there are no such
           arms, the feature may be terminated.

        -  The junction list  may  also  be  used  for  preguidance  (see  Feature
           selection).




  5.6  [3mRegistration[0m [3mof[0m [3mdata[0m


        -  By the automatic measurement  of  4  control  points  or  a  grid,  the
           coordinates  in digitiser space can be related to those in map (target)
           space.  One of these points (or optionally a user-specified  point)  is
           selected  as a check fiducial, and is measured at intervals to maintain
           registration.

        -  Any distortions inherent in the photographic reduction process  can  be
           compensated  for  by  digitising a known grid, photographed at the same
           time as the original document.  If the document has a grid  on  it,  an
           option  is  available  to  digitise  this  grid  and compensate for any
           distortions in the document.
