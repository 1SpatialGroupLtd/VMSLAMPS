  1.1  [3mIntroduction[0m

  LASERAID is the control program for  the  Laser-Scan  line-following  digitiser,
  LASERTRAK.   It  is the first of a sequence of programs which combine to produce
  high quality digital data from a source document.   Assisted  by  the  operator,
  LASERAID will capture features on a reduced negative and output the results as a
  stream of coordinates to a file on disk.

  The resulting file structure is Laser-Scan's own IFF (Internal Feature  Format),
  which  offers  the combined benefits of compactness and efficiency.  It contains
  various kinds of data in addition to the coordinates, such as line  thicknesses,
  coding  information  and,  optionally,  a  'link-and-node' structure for holding
  networks.

  This document describes the LASERAID user interface in  terms  of  the  commands
  available to the operator; it assumes a certain familiarity with the concepts of
  digitising using LASERTRAK.  See the 'Introductory Guide to Digitising with  the
  Laser-Scan LASERTRAK' for a more detailed description of the digitising process.



  1.2  [3mOverview[0m

  When LASERAID is invoked it reads a 'patch' file containing values for  all  the
  various  digitising  'parameters'  and  'command macros' (see sections 8 and 9).
  There  is  a  pause,  after  which  the  message  'Initialisation completed'  is
  displayed.

  The subsequent use of LASERAID divides naturally into three stages.   The  first
  stage  involves the automated calibration of the LASERTRAK and definition of the
  target coordinate system for the resulting data.  This includes the  measurement
  of  a  standard  calibration  grid  and/or  a  set  of  four  'control  points'.
  Additional information such as 'wash coding' may also be entered at this stage.

  When the setup procedure is complete, stage two is entered in which a feature is
  selected to be digitised and any extra information is added.  Stage three is the
  actual feature capture process, during which operator guidance may be requested.
  When  the  feature has been accepted, or feature capture has been abandoned, the
  program returns to stage two ready for the next feature.

  Stages two and three alternate until the digitising session  is  complete.   The
  End  Of  Session  (EOS)  command  is  then  given  in stage two to exit from the
  program.  The patch file is completely remade at  the  end  of  each  digitising
  session  using the parameter settings current at that time.  This means that the
  operator's initialisation work  (parameter  tuning,  LASERTRAK  setup  etc.)  is
  greatly  reduced  if  the  next  session is on the same (or a related) map.  The
  current calibration coefficients and control point values are also stored in the
  patch file.

  Each of the above stages involves one or more program levels (or 'modes'),  each
  with  its  own  set of commands and characteristic use of the LASERTRAK function
  buttons.

  2  [3mHARDWARE[0m [3mDESCRIPTION[0m

  A standard Laser-Scan HRD-1 (High Resolution  Display)  contains  a  blue  laser
  which  is  deflected  under program control to write on photochromic film.  This
  film is normally clear, and is darkened when exposed to the  blue  laser  light.
  This  image  of black lines on white is continuously back-projected onto a large
  screen by orange light to which the film is insensitive.  The resultant image is
  black lines on orange.

  LASERTRAK has an additional red laser of low power which follows the  same  path
  as  the  blue.   A  film  negative to be digitised is placed in contact with the
  photochromic film, producing a superimposed image of the map on the screen  with
  clear  lines  on  a  black  background.  A photomultiplier positioned behind the
  photochromic film detects lines on the film by measuring the  intensity  of  the
  red  beam  after  passing  through the two films in contact.  LASERAID uses this
  information to follow a line on the film, after which the blue laser is used  to
  paint  over the clear-on-black image with a black line on the photochromic film.
  This effectively removes that line from the image on the  screen,  so  that  the
  operator  can  see  which  lines  have  already  been  digitised.  They are also
  rendered invisible to the photomultiplier.  If the painted  out  line  does  not
  overlay  the  digitised  line,  possible causes are the negative or photochromic
  film being inserted back to front (the emulsions of both films must be  next  to
  each other), or CRX/Y not set up correctly (see section 4.1.2).

  To insert the film unlock and open the door on the right hand side of the optics
  unit,  and  slide  out  the film holder, which is on the far right (black handle
  with catch at bottom), taking care it does not catch on the  photochromic  film.
  The  negative slides under the clamps on the holder.  The emulsion should always
  be 'up' (next to the photochromic film).  Normally, the original will have  been
  photographed  'upside  down',  and  the  negative  will  also have been inserted
  'upside down', so that the image is right reading on the screen.



  2.1  [3mControls[0m

  The LASERTRAK controls are positioned so that the operator can reach the tracker
  ball,  function  buttons  and keyboard while seated in front of the main screen.
  Onto the main screen are projected the images of the film negative and the  main
  cursor (a red cross which can be moved by rolling the tracker ball).

  The close-up screen is used for keyboard command reflection, any error messages,
  and  for  displaying  graphs  during  the  setup procedure.  It can also show an
  enlargement of the area around the  main  cursor,  optionally  with  a  close-up
  cursor  for fine positioning.  This cursor is a pair of cross-hairs which can be
  moved using controls on the Tektronix keyboard.  When the  cursor  is  correctly
  positioned, typing any character transmits the position to the program.

  3  [3mCOMMANDS[0m

  LASERAID is normally invoked at the LASERTRAK terminal  by  giving  the  command
  'LAJ'  followed  by one or more qualifiers as described in the next section (the
  acronym LAJ may be taken to stand for '[3mL[0mines, [3mA[0mrea-features  and  [3mJ[0munctions',  a
  description  of  the  digitising capabilities of the program).  When the message
  'Initialisation completed' is displayed, LASERAID is ready to be used.

  Commands are given to the  program  via  the  function  buttons  (FBs)  and  the
  keyboard.   In general the most common commands at any time are available on the
  function buttons, while less common commands (and  those  requiring  numbers  or
  text  as arguments) are given via the keyboard.  Each function button command is
  also available via the keyboard by typing its name (note  that  only  the  first
  three  letters  of any command are significant).  Typing '?' at the keyboard (at
  any time when a command is expected) will display the  current  function  button
  meanings  and  all  the commands available in the current LASERAID mode.  Typing
  '??' will produce a list of all the topics for which on-line help  is  available
  in that mode, and '? topic' will display the on-line help for that topic.



  3.1  [3mCommand-line[0m [3mQualifiers[0m

  The following may be specified on the command line:

       1.  The IFF Filename

           LASERAID can either create a new IFF file or add data to the end of  an
           existing  one.   The  default file specification is LSL$IF:IFF.IFF, and
           this will be used to substitute any part of the filename not  given  by
           the  user.   Note  that  if  the  filename  is numeric (e.g.  999), the
           resulting file specification will be LSL$IF:IFF.999.

           The commands are:

           IFF <file>      to create a new file
           NEW <file>
           TO <file>
           <file>          (if first command on line)

           or

           OLD <file>      to add to an existing file
           APP <file>
           UPD <file>

       2.  The 'Patch' File

           The PATCH file (sometimes also known as the LINK file) is used to  keep
           the  values  of  the digitising parameters from one session to another.
           Its  name  defaults  to  LSL$LK:LNK.LAJ,  however  normally  the   user
           specifies  the  required  file  by  means  of  the 'WITh' command (e.g.
           WIT URBAN).  The name of the file is often used to indicate the type of
           operation  for which the patch file is tuned, and if several LASERTRAKs
           are in use at a site, it is usual to append the machine number  to  the
           end  of  the filename (e.g.  URBAN114.LAJ).  It is recommended that the
           file type is not changed.

       3.  Use of the LASERTRAK

           The command 'NOD' (NO Display) will suppress the use of the  LASERTRAK.
           Note,  however,  that  very few operations can be performed under these
           circumstances.

       4.  Photochromic Film Advance

           The photochromic film may be wound on one frame by giving  the  command
           'NP'.

       5.  Height Coding Specifier

           The commands HTD or  HTI  (optionally  followed  by  a  value)  may  be
           specified   on   the  command  line  and  cause  LASERAID  to  use  the
           corresponding method for coding height information (see  section  5.4).
           By  default  it is assumed that the IFF feature numbers will be used to
           hold height values.



  Typical command lines are:

           LAJ <file> [WITH <patchfile>] [HTD <value>]

        or LAJ OLD <file> [WITH <patchfile>] [NP]



  3.1.1  [3mReading-in[0m [3mOLD[0m [3mFiles[0m -

  The OLD command-line option enables data to be added to an  existing  IFF  file.
  LASERAID  recognises  two  varieties  of  such files, which are termed 'old' and
  'very old'.

  An 'old' IFF file contains data digitised using converged LASERAID.   It  should
  be  unprocessed (i.e.  not passed through LAPROCESS).  The file is read straight
  into LASERAID, any incomplete junctions are put into the 'in-core junction list'
  and digitising may continue.  This is the normal use of the OLD command.

  A 'very old' file is one digitised using a pre-convergence version  of  LASERAID
  (old LAJ, FLF or ELA).  Note that in this case the file should already have been
  processed using LAPROCESS.  The data are not actually read into  LASERAID  until
  the  control  point  (CP)  measurement  has been performed, (see section 4.3) at
  which time  they  are  overlaid  onto  the  output  coordinate  system.   If  an
  unprocessed  'very  old'  file  is  read  into  LASERAID  the  results  will  be
  unpredictable (but wrong).

  In general, only those buttons which are valid or active  are  illuminated.   In
  the overall plan of function button commands, FB 16 is usually ABAndon, which is
  the failure exit, returning to a higher program mode  and  undoing  as  much  as
  possible  as  it  goes.   FB 4  is  usually OK or GO, which is the success exit.
  Other buttons are used  for  commands  specific  to  the  current  mode.   These
  commands  are positioned so that the pattern of function button lights is easily
  recognisable for each mode.

  Commands at the keyboard are recognised by their first three letters, hence  ABA
  is  sufficient  for  the  ABAndon command.  If a command requires any arguments,
  these must be typed on the same line.

  When the message 'Initialisation completed' is displayed, LASERAID has read  the
  patch  file  (and dealt with any OLD file specified on the command line), and is
  ready for interaction.  At this stage the program is  in  MAIN  mode,  which  is
  described in more detail in section 5.

  The first action of the operator is to set up the LASERTRAK so that it can 'see'
  the  linework  on  the  negative.   This is achieved by means of CHECK mode (see
  below).  After this a standard grid may be digitised for  calibration  purposes,
  and the four control points are measured.  Digitising may then commence.

  The digitiser threshold should be set up first, after which the phase correction
  can be performed.  There are, in fact, two phase corrections (one for each axis)
  so this must be done on both a horizontal and a vertical track.  The process  is
  repeated automatically for each of the different scan widths in the 'type table'
  (see section 8.5).  If the negative to be digitised has very fine  lines  it  is
  also  worth  adjusting the focus of the red digitising spot.  If any maintenance
  work has been performed on either the  blue  or  red  beam  optics,  it  may  be
  necessary  to recalculate the red/blue offsets and counts ratios.  The procedure
  for performing these corrections is described in the following sections.


  LASERAID - the Laser-Scan Digitiser                                       Page 8


  The general state of the machine may be checked by drawing a  few  close-ups  of
  different  areas of the negative using the CLO command, and by using the QUL and
  QUW commands.  If the LASERTRAK has just been  turned  on  it  is  advisable  to
  perform  some long 'dummy' scans in order to allow the thresholding circuitry to
  stabilise.  A stable threshold will produce crisp close-ups.



  4.1.2.1  [3mHardware[0m [3mCorrections[0m -

  These are the parameters which are concerned with the behaviour of the digitiser
  hardware.   They  include  the  digitiser discrimination threshold (TLO) and the
  phase corrections for the two axes (PHX and PHY).  They can all be set in  CHECK
  mode.

  The digitiser can work with two types of  thresholding:   manual  or  automatic.
  The  mode  is  controlled by the Threshold Switch TSW.  If this is set to 1 then
  manual threshold is selected, and 0 selects  automatic  threshold.   One  caveat
  associated with automatic threshold is that the threshold tends to drift towards
  zero if no scans are being done, and it takes  about  half  a  scan  to  correct
  itself.   Hence  the  first  scan  after  a  pause  in  digitising  may  not see
  everything.

  The correct parameter values are established by repeatedly measuring a piece  of
  track while varying the appropriate parameter.  The encounters measured are then
  analysed to provide the best value for  the  parameter.   The  procedure  is  as
  follows:

       1.  Place the cursor on a clear, straight track and press the button STArt.

       2.  Move the cursor to indicate the portion of the  line  to  be  measured.
           (this  should  be  at most one centimetre long on the screen) and press
           THR or PHA.

       3.  A graph will be drawn on the close-up screen showing the results of the
           digitisation  against  the  parameter being measured.  The parameter is
           set by choosing the value that gives the best  result,  and  indicating
           this value using the close-up cursor.




  4.1.2.2  [3mThreshold[0m [3m(TLO)[0m -

  With TSW 1 set this should produce a graph similar to the one in Figure 1.   The
  optimum threshold is the mid point of the flat part of the threshold.

  The X axis of the graph is increasing TLO, and the vertical axis is  the  number
  of  black/white  and white/black transitions seen in the scan.  If TLO is set at
  the extreme left hand side of the graph, everything is seen as white.  The spike
  (especially  pronounced if the line has 'stipple' on one or both sides) is where
  small amounts of black are beginning to appear in  the  white.   The  horizontal
  line is the region where the line is seen in its entirety, although its apparent
  thickness decreases with increasing TLO, and conversely the apparent gap between
  adjacent lines increases.  At the right hand side, the line is breaking up, with
  gaps starting to appear.

  The phase value compensates for the fact that the minimirrors usually  scan  the
  lines   in  alternating  directions.   The  phase  is  different  for  different
  frequencies and different widths.  If the phase is wrong, a  close-up  may  look
  appear as in Figure 3.

  If the scanner is running at a high frequency and large pitch,  the  minimirrors
  may  already  have reversed their direction before the 'along the axis move' has
  completed, in which case the scan is delayed until the  minimirrors  have  again
  changed direction.  This can give the appearance of perfect phase correction.

  To set the focus of the red beam, first set up a scan vector in one axis, draw a
  threshold  graph  and select a point halfway down the falling side of the curve.
  Then press FOC (FB 13) to draw the focus graph.  This should be of similar shape
  to  a threshold graph, and the maximum height should be selected.  The procedure
  should then be repeated for the other axis to check that the digitising spot  is
  not  astigmatic.   If  the  graphs  from  the  two  axis  do not overlay exactly
  (typically they will not) then  a  mean  position  should  be  selected.   After
  setting  the focus it is necessary to remeasure the threshold to reset it to the
  normal value.

  manner.   On  pressing  WHL (FB 3), a line will be drawn.  Then press OCR (FB 2)
  which will draw a graph  and  set  the  parameters  automatically.   The  graphs
  produced  should  (after two or three OCR scans) lie along the 45 degree line on
  the 'goal-post', without any large deviations or systematic effects.  This setup

  Two commands are available to give qualitative and quantitative measurements  of
  the quality of digitising.  These are QUL (FB 14) and QUW (FB 15).  QUL measures
  the quality of observed line position across  the  width  of  a  scan,  and  QUW
  measures  the  quality  of observed line width similarly.  These are used on any
  orientation of straight line, and should produce approximately horizontal traces
  on   the  close-up  screen  (the  vertical  position  of  these  traces  is  not
  significant).

  4.2  [3mStandard[0m [3mGrid[0m [3m(CALIBRATE[0m [3mMode)[0m

  Calibration provides a set of cubic coefficients  which  relate  the  coordinate
  systems  of  the  digitiser  and  the source map, correcting for any distortions
  introduced by the photographic processes involved in  producing  the  digitising
  negative,  and  for  any non-linearities in the LASERTRAK optics.  A calibration
  should be done for each BATCH of negatives (the coefficients  are  preserved  in
  the  patch  file  so it is not necessary to calibrate each individual negative),
  and after any work has been done on the optics of the digitiser.  To  perform  a
  calibration the following procedure should be followed:

  Give the command CALibrate with an argument  which  is  the  size  of  the  grid
  squares.  This size is only used to normalise the residual values, and should be
  given either in microns on the reduced negative or millimetres on the map.   You
  will then be asked to outline a grid using the LASERTRAK cursor and the function
  buttons (the extent of the grid and the X/Y increments must be specified).

  When the description of the grid is complete, it will be measured.  The  program
  attempts  to  measure  each intersection automatically.  However, if this fails,
  the operator is asked to measure it manually using the commands described in the
  next  section.   When the grid has been measured, press OK (FB 4) to perform the
  fit;  the  calibration  coefficients  are  calculated  and  the  residuals   are
  displayed.  If the residuals are very uneven, or if the RMS residuals are large,
  then reject the calibration by pressing NO (FB 16).  Otherwise accept them  with
  OK  (FB 4).   If  accepted,  the  coefficients  will  be  applied  to subsequent
  coordinate data prior to output to the IFF file and will be saved in  the  patch
  file  at  end  of  session.   If the fit is rejected then you can try again with
  better threshold and/or phase, or a better grid.

  If the switch FCT is set to 1 in HELP mode (see section 7), then the calibration
  is incorporated in the control point (CP) set up described in section 4.3.

  If a digitised dataset is found to be distorted and the problem is traced  to  a
  bad  CALibration  (e.g.   the  wrong  grid  negative  was  used), a mechanism is
  available by which a new calibration can be  substituted,  hopefully  correcting
  the  problem.   It  should be noted that the [3msame[0m [3mLASERTRAK[0m must be used both to
  digitise and correct the data.  The LASERTRAK device name and machine number are
  included  in  the operator identification text (in the IFF NS entries), assuming
  that the OPerator command was not given (see section 4.4).

  A [3mCOPY[0m of the [3mUNPROCESSED[0m distorted file should be read into converged  LASERAID
  using  the  'OLD'  command  option.  A CALibration and Control Point measurement
  should be made as usual, and then the RECover command can be  given.   When  the
  command  finishes,  LASERAID can be terminated as usual and the calibration will
  have been replaced.

  It should be noted  that  it  is  NOT  possible  to  correct  'very  old'  files
  (digitised using pre-convergence versions of LASERAID) in this way.

  4.3  [3mControl[0m [3mPoints[0m [3m(MEASURE[0m [3mMode)[0m

  The Control Points are measured by giving the command  CP  in  MAIN  mode.   The
  LASERTRAK  cursor  will  automatically move to the vicinity of the first control
  point and the appropriate prompt will be displayed on the  terminal  screen  (NW
  for  the  first  point).   The coordinates of this control point in map (target)
  space may then be entered to replace the current values, and the  cursor  should
  be  positioned  over  the  point  using  the tracker ball.  AUT (FB 2) will then
  attempt to digitise the control point automatically.  If this fails the close-up
  screen  and cross-hair cursor may be used.  The available commands are listed in
  the next section.

  When the command OK (FB 4) is given, the position is stored and the cursor moves
  to  the next control point for the process to be repeated.  Note however that it
  is not sufficient simply to move the cursor to the required position  and  press
  FB 4.   A  scan  must be performed for the position to be registered.  After all
  four control points have been processed in this way, the whole set may be either
  accepted or rejected.

  After the four control points have been measured the user is asked to specify  a
  check  fiducial.   This  intersection will be remeasured at regular intervals to
  check for LASERTRAK slip, etc.  If the specified tolerance is  exceeded  then  a
  message  is  printed  and the last feature may be deleted by typing CANcel.  The
  control points should then be redigitised before continuing.

  If the user specifies a number in the  range  1  to  4,  this  will  select  the
  corresponding control point as the fiducial.  A fiducial number of zero disables
  fiducial checking completely.

  If the user specifies fiducial '-1', the tracker ball may be used  to  select  a
  fiducial  which  is  unrelated  to  the  control  points  (it  need  only  be an
  intersection of suitable quality).  The user  rolls  the  tracker  ball  to  the
  required  intersection  and presses FB 4.  The intersection is then scanned and,
  if found successfully, it may be  accepted  using  FB 4  (otherwise  it  may  be
  re-scanned in the usual manner).

  When the fiducial has been accepted, LASERAID will ask how  often  the  fiducial
  check  should  be performed ('After how many features ?'), and for a measurement
  tolerance in microns on the negative.  Typical values for these might be every 5
  features  with an error limit of 15 microns.  The command CHF (q.v.) may be used
  to alter these values.

  It should be noted that once a check fiducial has  been  selected  (by  whatever
  means), if -1 is entered on SUBSEQUENT occasions it will cause the SAME fiducial
  and set of parameters to be used again.  The user does  not  have  to  roll  the
  tracker ball or answer any further questions (-1 is taken to mean 'same again').

  If the user subsequently wishes to select a new fiducial by means of the tracker
  ball, the existing settings must first be cleared by specifying CHF 0 0.

  If the switch FCT is set to 1, calibration and  control  point  measurement  are
  merged  into  one  operation.   The  combined procedure is to type CP, which now
  causes a calibration to be performed.  At the end, any grid intersection may  be
  selected  as  a  check  fiducial  by  positioning the cursor in its vicinity and
  pressing FB 4, after which the usual questions are asked.

  As the name suggests, MAIN mode is the outermost level of LASERAID.  It contains
  the  commands  described  in  previous  sections  for entering CHECK mode (CHK),
  CALIBRATE mode (CAL) and MEASURE mode (CP), as well as LOCATE mode  (LOC)  which
  is  described later (section 5.5).  The EOS command for terminating a session is
  also given in MAIN mode.  As will be seen, several other commands are  available
  for controlling coding, pre-guidance and paintout.

  The primary function of MAIN mode is, however, feature selection  (corresponding
  to  'stage  two' as described in section 1.2).  A feature is selected by placing
  the LASERTRAK cursor over it and pressing the appropriate 'feature start' button
  (i.e.  FB 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or 7).

  Each of the 'feature start' function buttons (FBs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7) may  have
  associated with it:

       1.  a feature code, selectable using the FCF command

       2.  an implicit 'feature type':  linear feature for buttons 1, 2, 3 and  5,
           point  feature  (section  7.2) for button 6, and small feature (section
           7.3) for button 7

       3.  an explicit 'line type', defining a set of LASERAID  parameters  to  be
           used   when  following  features  started  using  this  button.   These
           parameter values are held  in  the  'type  table'  (section  8.5),  and
           selected  via the TYF command.  Seven line types are available, and any
           of these can be assigned to any of the 'start' function buttons.  It is
           NOT the case that FB 1 must use type 1 etc.

  It should be noted that the names of FBs 1, 2, 3 and 5 (i.e.  STRaight,  CURved,
  RANdom  and  ORThogonal) do not have any enforced significance.  FB 1 can be set
  up to follow a tortuous contour as easily as FB 3.   However,  the  meanings  of
  FB 6  and  FB 7  [3mare[0m  'hard-wired';  for  example it is not possible to follow a
  contour using FB 6, or to measure a  point  feature  using  FB 1.   However,  by
  assigning  different  line  types  to  FB 7 it is possible to determine the MODe
  (i.e.  edge or line) used when capturing small features (see section 7.3).



  5.3  [3mAncillary[0m [3mCoding[0m

  IFF features may contain any number of Ancillary Code (AC) entries which can  be
  used  to hold user-specific coding information.  AC entries are characterised by
  their TYPE; some AC types have fixed definitions (see the next section) but many
  are  available  for  user-specific  applications.   In practice, AC types 0 - 99
  should be considered  to  be  reserved  by  Laser-Scan  for  current  or  future


  LASERAID - the Laser-Scan Digitiser                                      Page 18


  applications.   Each  user  will normally be allocated a set of 20 contiguous AC
  types for their own use; additional groups will be  issued  on  request.   Users
  should restrict themselves to using their own ACs, otherwise confusion may arise
  when the data are processed using general Laser-Scan utilities.

  As each users group of private ACs will contain a constant offset (e.g.  he  may
  be  allocated  the  range 200 to 219), it would be inconvenient to have to enter
  the whole AC type each time.  Hence the ACB (AC Base) command is provided.  This
  specifies  a  number (200 in our example) which will be added to the type of all
  ACs explicitly created using SAC or AC, before the entry is inserted in the  IFF
  file.  The AC base is held in the patch file and will normally be transparent to
  the user once the system is installed.  Hence each user can consider himself  to
  have his own group of ACs in the range 0 to 19.  The command is provided in case
  of exceptional circumstances where the user may wish to access a different range
  of ACs.

  AC entries may be created in several ways.  LASERAID  may  automatically  create
  height  ACs (see below), the user may specify that a particular AC should appear
  in all features until further notice (this is termed  the  Standing  AC  and  is
  created  using  the  SAC  command),  or explicit AC entries may be added to each
  feature using the AC command.

  The Standing AC (SAC) command may only be given in MAIN mode (before  a  feature
  is begun).  The format of the command is:

            SAC type value [text]

  This AC is inserted in all subsequent features  until  altered  by  another  SAC
  command or explicitly disabled by SAC 0.  It is also preserved in the patch file
  between sessions.  Note that SAC 0 0 is a valid setting and produces:

            AC 'AC base' 0

  In the AC and SAC commands, the AC 'value' is examined for a decimal  point  and
  is stored as a real number if one is found.


  For example, the commands:

            ACB 1000

            SAC 1 50

            <start new feature>

            AC 5 123.6 POINT ELEVATION

  Would cause the following ACs to be inserted in the IFF file:

            AC 1001 50

            AC 1005 123.6 POINT ELEVATION

  It should be noted that the AC command MAY only be given  after  a  feature  has
  been  started  (using  function  buttons  1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or 7) and SHOULD only be
  given before any actual line following has begun for that feature.   AC  entries
  specified  after  line  following has begun may or may not be accepted (LASERAID


  LASERAID - the Laser-Scan Digitiser                                      Page 19


  will reject any attempt to create an AC once the first ST  in  the  feature  has
  been output to the IFF file).

  The current Standing AC and AC base may be examined by just typing SAC and  ACB,
  respectively.



  5.4  [3mHeight[0m [3mCoding[0m

  The traditional technique for holding height information within IFF has been  to
  use  the  feature  (NF)  number,  manipulated  in  LASERAID  via the ANF and MNF
  increment commands.  This approach has  many  limitations  (large,  negative  or
  non-integer  values  are  difficult  to  represent)  and so a mechanism has been
  introduced whereby heights may be held in special  AC  entries.   The  user  may
  choose  to  code  height information either as real numbers (stored in AC type 3
  entries) or as integers (stored in AC type 2 entries).  The current  height  may
  be  displayed  beside  the  cursor  (in  place of the feature number) and may be
  incremented automatically and/or manually.

  The commands HTD, HTI, MHT, AHT and NFI control  the  height  coding  mechanism.
  These  determine  both what is displayed beside the cursor and what is output to
  the IFF file.  The default  is  to  display  the  NF  number  (an  implicit  NFI
  command);  HTD  displays the height as a real (decimal) number (AC 3), while HTI
  displays the height as an integer (AC 2).  If HTD or HTI is given  an  argument,
  the  appropriate mode will be entered and the height will be initialised to that
  value, e.g.

            HTD 23.5

            HTI 120

  Note that HTD 100 is allowed, but HTI 53.5 is not.

  Once LASERAID is in 'height' mode,  any  numbers  typed  on  their  own  at  the
  keyboard  (in  MAIN mode) are interpreted as heights rather than feature numbers
  (the default).  The NF  number  output  to  the  IFF  file  is,  however,  still
  incremented  by  the value specified using ANF (default 1) as usual, although it
  is not displayed.  The NF command may  still  be  used  to  assign  specific  NF
  values.

  MHT and AHT control the manual and automatic height  increments  (both  zero  by
  default); these are directly analogous to the ANF and MNF commands.

  NFI returns to displaying the current NF number.  It should  be  noted  that  in
  this mode NO HEIGHT AC ENTRIES ARE PRODUCED.

  All of these commands may be given in MAIN mode (i.e.  before starting a feature
  using  function  buttons  1,  2,  3, 5, 6 or 7), however HTD and HTI may also be
  specified on the command line so that LASERAID comes up in the appropriate mode.
  For example:

            LAJ FRED WIT LNK122 HTD 300.5

  will put LASERAID into 'real height' mode and initialise the height to 300.5.

  5.5  [3mLOCATE[0m [3mMode[0m

  The LOCate command enables the user to find  up  to  four  previously  digitised
  features  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the LASERTRAK cursor and selectively
  repaint or delete them.  The features must lie within a  screen  area  of  about
  3 cm  square  centred  on  the cursor in order to be found.  If any features are
  found, LASERAID enters LOCATE mode to allow interaction with them.

  It should be noted that LOCate has to scan the whole IFF file and  may  be  very
  slow  if  a  lot  of  data has been captured.  The search can be be abandoned by
  pressing FB 16.

  6  [3mHELP[0m [3mMODE[0m

  When a line-feature 'start' button is pressed in MAIN mode (see section 5) then,
  assuming  that  FINd  (FB 10)  is  not enabled, the program pauses with the scan
  vector (or 'tramlines') displayed for guidance.  LASERAID is then in HELP mode.

  HELP mode is the  main  interaction  level,  in  which  all  the  line-following
  parameters are available to the operator as well as commands for controlling the
  digitising process.  The most important parameters are discussed  in  section  8
  (with  additional  information in Appendix A and the on-line help), and the most
  common commands are described below.   Some  of  these  commands  are  discussed
  further in section 7.

  HELP mode may be  temporarily  entered  from  MAIN  mode  for  the  purposes  of
  examining  or modifying parameter values by means of the ADJust command (section
  5.1).

  HELP mode is different from the other program states described in this document,
  as the function button layout is context-dependent.  The current function button
  meanings can be displayed at any time when a command is expected by typing '?'

  Some useful keyboard-only commands in HELP mode are:

            PPP            print primary (user) parameters (see section 8.1)
            PAP            print all parameters (see section 8.1)
            PTY            print type table (see section 8.5)
            PMA            print macro commands (see section 9)
            PLW            print limits and weights (see section 8.4)
            TYPe n         set current line type to n



  6.2  [3mOperator[0m [3mGuidance[0m

  Apart from at the start of a feature,  there  are  two  other  cases  where  the
  program  will  automatically pause for operator guidance.  The first is where it
  has found a piece of line which it believes to be the correct one, but  requires
  verification because either there are several equally good possibilities, or the
  only one is of poor quality (see section 8.7 for a discussion of chain quality).
  In  either  case  the  best  line  is  shown  in refresh and alternatives may be
  selected using NXT (FB 8).  If it has totally the wrong line then BB (FB 15) may
  be  used  to  enable  backtracking, and ONE (FB 3) may be used to display a scan
  vector with which to guide the program in the correct direction.

  The other occasion is when the digitiser cannot  see  any  continuation  of  the
  current line.  In this case it shows a scan vector to request a new direction in
  which to look.  The commands MP (manual Master Point) and HOP are useful in this
  case to get across difficult sections of line.



  6.3  [3mManual[0m [3mIntervention[0m

  The user may interrupt the line  following  process  by  pressing  FB 15.   This
  button,  which is always available when following and corresponds to the command
  macro INT (see section 9), causes LASERAID to pause in HELP mode.   All  of  the
  interaction facilities associated with HELP mode are then available.



  6.4  [3mManual[0m [3mDigitising[0m

  In the event that the line work is too complex, or of such poor quality that the
  digitiser cannot follow it automatically, three methods of manual digitising are
  available

       1.  Pressing MP (FB 10) once will enter MANUAL mode, and  repeated  presses
           will create a Master Point at the LASERTRAK cursor position, controlled
           by the tracker ball.

       2.  The master points may be positioned more accurately in MANUAL  mode  by
           typing  CLOse-up  at  the  keyboard.   A  view  of  the area around the
           LASERTRAK cursor is drawn on the Tektronix.  The cross-hair cursor  may
           then be positioned over the point to be created, and any key pressed to
           accept it.  This positions the LASERTRAK cursor, after which FB 10  may
           be pressed to create a master point.


  LASERAID - the Laser-Scan Digitiser                                      Page 24


       3.  Several master points may be created  using  the  Tektronix  screen  by
           typing the command MANual at the keyboard.  This again draws a close-up
           on the screen and invokes the cross-hair cursor,  but  this  time  each
           press of the space bar creates a master point.  The letter 'E' ends the
           sequence (without creating a master point).


  When a manual point has been created using the first  two  methods,  it  can  be
  turned  into  a  junction  by means of the MAJ command (see section 7.1.1).  The
  same is true of the final master point created using the third method.

  7.1  [3mLine[0m [3mFeatures[0m

  As mentioned in section 6, when a line-feature 'start' button is pressed in MAIN
  mode  the  scan  vector  is  usually  displayed  (but see the discussion of FINd
  below), and LASERAID is in HELP mode.  On pressing GO (FB 4)  the  program  will
  search  for the first section of track and will pause with anything it has found
  displayed in refresh.  If the wrong section of line has been located, NXT (FB 8)
  may  be  used  to cycle through the known 'chain elements'.  If none of these is
  acceptable, or nothing was seen at all, ONE (FB 3) may be  pressed  after  which
  the  correct  scan position and orientation can be indicated via the scan vector
  and tracker ball.  MOV (FB 14) switches between 'change  scan  orientation'  and
  'change  scan position'.  When the scan vector is repositioned, GO (FB 4) may be
  pressed again.

  Once an acceptable  starting  track  segment  is  displayed,  automatic  feature
  capture  (line  following)  may  be  initiated  by pressing GO (FB 4) again, and
  following will continue until:

       1.  the end of the feature is reached, or

       2.  the program requires assistance (see section 6.2), or

       3.  the operator intervenes manually (see section 6.3).


  Note that if automatic FINd (FB 10) has been enabled in MAIN mode (this is often
  referred  to  as  'fumbling'),  then  line  following will begin immediately the
  'feature start' button is pressed.  In this case the  operator  has  no  control
  over  the  starting direction.  Typically a feature digitised using FINd will be
  started in the middle.  When one half of the line has been captured  it  may  be
  accepted  using  END  (FB 12),  and LASERAID will then return to the start point
  with the scan oriented so as to digitise the second half.  Line following may be
  initiated  by pressing GO (FB 4).  Line types which may have FINd enabled should
  contain the parameter INI set to 15 in the type table (see also section  8.5.3).
  Note  that  FINd  should  not  be used with features which contain junctions, as
  current post-processing software is unable to re-order such features to  give  a
  common direction.

  LASERAID can follow linear features in either 'edge mode' (for the  boundary  of
  solid  areas)  or 'line mode' (for contours, rivers etc.).  The required mode is
  selected by the value of the parameter MOD given to the line  type  assigned  to
  the starting function button (see section 8.5).  MOD 1 selects line mode and MOD
  0 selects edge mode.



  7.1.1  [3mJunctions[0m -

  LASERAID is able to capture 'link-and-node' data  by  recognising  junctions  in
  continuous  linework.   The junction 'arms' (or links) are 'snapped' to a common
  point to ensure the geometrical integrity of the data, even if  the  actual  IFF
  cross-pointers are subsequently removed.


  LASERAID - the Laser-Scan Digitiser                                      Page 26


  In order to recognise junctions, at least one line type must be set  up  in  the
  type  table  to  have appropriate parameter values.  The most important of these
  parameters are JNC, INI, CRS and SPD, which are  discussed  in  section  8.   If
  junction  spotting  is enabled LASERAID will, while line following, be sensitive
  to conditions symptomatic of junctions and will attempt to locate a junction  if
  these  conditions are met.  The first time a particular junction is encountered,
  a scan is made in both axes (using line type 7),  and  an  attempt  is  made  to
  decipher  the junction to determine its position and number of arms.  If this is
  successful, the  number  of  arms  is  displayed  in  refresh  for  verification
  purposes.

  If  'auto-accept-and-go'  is  enabled   (see   section   8.6),   LASERAID   will
  automatically accept the junction after a brief pause for verification, and will
  continue line following along an arm selected on  the  basis  of  parameter  CRS
  (q.v.).   Otherwise  the program will wait at each junction with the appropriate
  exit arm indicated in refresh.  If  GO  (FB 4)  is  pressed  this  arm  will  be
  appended  and  digitising will continue.  NXT (FB 8) will cycle through the arms
  (and possibly other junctions if more that one has been found in  a  scan),  and
  JIN (FB 9) will perform another junction search and analysis.

  Once a junction has been found it is stored in the so-called  'in-core  junction
  list'  until  all of its arms have been digitised.  By default this list is used
  to recognise existing junctions  during  line  following,  causing  LASERAID  to
  'snap' to these automatically without performing another complete area-scan each
  time they are visited.

  In order that junctions can be 'spotted' on subsequent visits, it  is  necessary
  to leave a portion of each arm unpainted when the junction is accepted.  This is
  controlled by the parameter SPD which is discussed in section 8.6.

  The command FPJ (FB 13) in HELP mode enables junction recognition to be disabled
  and  re-enabled  after  line  following has begun.  This can sometimes be useful
  when following poor  quality  linework  where  the  true  junctions  are  widely
  separated  and the data quality causes LASERAID to do unnecessary work rejecting
  spurious encounters.  The user  pauses  line  following  using  FB 15  and  then
  presses  FB 13.  Line following can be resumed using FB 4.  The current state of
  junction recognition (i.e.  enabled or disabled) is indicated by FB 13  (lit  =>
  enabled).

  The in-core list mentioned above can also be used for pre-guidance, assuming  no
  external  guidance  file is already open (see section 10).  After a junction has
  been accepted, pressing FB 8 (GNF) will cause the program to position the cursor
  over  the next incomplete junction in the list.  Repeated use of FB 8 will cycle
  through this list.  After FB 8, the normal feature-start button can be  used  to
  locate  the  junction,  and it should be seen that the arm offered is one of the
  currently unsatisfied ones.  If the digitiser captures a junction which  has  no
  remaining  unsatisfied  arms (i.e.  there is no exit route), the message 'End of
  feature ?' is displayed.  This is to indicate to the user  that  he  should  not
  expect  to  be  able  to  line-follow  out  of  the  junction  - the question is
  rhetorical!

  If the digitiser misses  a  junction  or,  for  example,  auto-accept-and-go  is
  enabled  and  the  program's idea of the best arm to follow does not accord with
  the operator's, line following can be stopped using FB 15 and HELP mode will  be
  entered.  Pressing FB 15 (BB) again will enable rolling mode (and BACk), so that
  the digitised line can be rolled back to the  junction  position,  and  junction
  recognition  can  be  invoked  manually using JIN (FB 9).  Alternatively, if the

  junction was recognised correctly the user can roll back (or BACk up with FB 15)
  until he is ON the junction (the tolerance is JPT), and press FB 8 (LJN - Locate
  JunctioN).  If he is close enough to the junction it is found, taken  'in  hand'
  and  the previously followed arm is offered.  FB 8 has then been redefined to be
  NXT, which can be used to cycle through the arms.  It should be noted  that  the
  refresh  arm  indicated at this stage is a direction only, it will typically not
  lie exactly along the source linework.  When the required arm is indicated, FB 4
  will restart line following.

  If LASERAID is unable to capture a particular junction (e.g.  because  the  line
  quality  is  too  poor), a 'manual' junction can be created by using the command
  'MAJ n' in association with MANUAL  mode  digitising  (see  section  6.4).   The
  mandatory  argument  'n' is the number of junction arms.  When a manual junction
  is subsequently encountered while line following,  or  located  using  LJN,  the
  message  'Manual junction' is output on the close-up screen and the program will
  pause with the scan vector ('tramlines') displayed for  the  user  to  choose  a
  direction  to  resume line following (or accept the feature).  The tramlines can
  be rotated using the tracker ball as usual, and FB 4 will resume line  following
  in the chosen direction.  Note that FB 3 (ONE) should not normally be pressed in
  this situation as this may cause LASERAID simply to  find  the  manual  junction
  again.

  Note that there are some restrictions on the use of manual junctions.   Firstly,
  although  LASERAID  knows  how  many  arms  the manual junction has (this is the
  mandatory argument to the MAJ command), the angles are unknown.  This means that
  the IFF junction structure cannot be completely set up.  Secondly, no attempt is
  made at present to spot the fact that all the arms of  a  manual  junction  have
  been  measured.   This  has  the  side  effect  that  manual junctions are never
  automatically deleted from the in-core  junction  list  and  may  be  repeatedly
  offered.  If all other junctions are complete then the WHOLE in-core list can be
  deleted by using the ZJC command.



  7.1.2  [3mInverse[0m [3mPolarity[0m [3mLinework[0m -

  By default, LASERAID line-follows negatives with 'white' (transparent) lines  on
  a  'black'  (opaque)  background.   The  command  INV causes the polarity of all
  encounters returned by the LASERTRAK to be inverted, enabling black lines to  be
  followed.   Specifying INV 1 (either in HELP mode or in the type tables) enables
  this facility; INV 0 disables it.  The current main use of this mechanism is  in
  the  following of double-line rivers or roads where only a single centre line is
  required.  Paint out is achieved by drawing a pair of parallel lines either side
  of  the  measured  centre  line.  The separation of these lines is set using the
  current THK/PTH mechanism (see section 8), but some  care  should  be  exercised
  when  setting  this  value as the painted lines are rather thin.  A good rule of
  thumb is to determine the typical line width using the Z and C macros  (see  the
  on-line  help), and then set the thickness to be about 1.5 times this value.  It
  should be noted  that  the  LASERTRAK  [3mhardware[0m  still  considers  black  to  be
  background,  and  hence  is  not  able  to clean up the signal as efficiently as
  normal.  It may be found, therefore, that the line  following  process  is  more
  susceptible  to  variations  in  negative  quality when inverse-polarity mode is
  used.  In particular, it will be found that when  following  double  lines  with
  junctions enabled, any break in either line will be seen as a possible three-arm
  junction.  It is recommended, therefore, that FB 13 (FPJ) be used to temporarily
  disable junction spotting when following long stretches of double-linework which
  do not contain any real junctions.

  7.2  [3mPoint[0m [3mFeatures[0m

  A point feature scan is invoked by pressing FB 6 in MAIN mode.  In  the  default
  POINT  mode  the program attempts to digitise a symbol automatically by scanning
  and looking for a cross (x or +) or a very small ring.   If  this  succeeds  the
  cursor  is  positioned over the symbol and a dot is displayed in refresh.  If it
  fails then a message is printed and the cursor remains as it was.  The  commands
  are  shown below.  OK (FB 4) reads the current cursor position and writes it out
  as a single point feature.

  LASERAID contains a  second  POINT  mode  facility,  'square  buildings'.   This
  enables  one  or  more  building  features (represented by filled squares) to be
  captured in a single scan, and output to the IFF file as [3moriented[0m [3msymbols[0m.  This
  facility  is selected by command PNT, which can be given interactively or placed
  in the type tables.  PNT 0 specifies the traditional point feature mode, and PNT
  1  specifies square building mode.  PNT only determines the [3mdefault[0m scan type on
  entry to point feature mode (i.e.  on pressing function button 6 in MAIN  mode);
  once  in  this  mode  either  type of scan can be selected by using the function
  buttons (see below).  PNT is preserved in the patch file at end of session,  and
  old  patch  files  (which  do  not  have  an explicit PNT entry at read-in time)
  default to PNT 0.

  The function button layout for point mode is given below:

  Traditional point scans are performed using the line type specified  for  button
  6,  but  square building scans use type 1.  It is recommended that the pitch for
  type 1 be set to 10 (there is no benefit in setting it any lower).

  When a square building scan is performed, buildings within the scan  region  are
  recognised  and  highlighted in refresh (the scan box is also shown; this may be
  moved using the trackerball and another scan performed if required).  The number
  of  features  found  in  the scan is displayed in refresh beside the highlighted
  objects.  Pressing FB 4 (OK) will cause [3mALL[0m these features to be accepted in one
  go  (they  will  be  placed  into  separate  IFF  features, with feature numbers
  incremented by ANF as usual).  If, however, the  user  does  not  want  all  the
  indicated features, pressing FB 8 (NXT) will cause LASERAID to cycle through the
  found objects in turn.  When a desired object is highlighted, pressing FB 4 will
  cause it to be accepted and the next object (if any) will be refreshed.  ABA may
  be used to drop any remaining unwanted objects, returning  to  MAIN  mode.   DRF
  will  draw  any  highlighted  objects  on  the  Tektronix, displaying a cross to
  indicate the position and orientation of the point feature.

  Ancillary codes (ACs) may be manually added to the feature prior  to  acceptance
  by  means  of  the AC command (see section 5.3).  Note, however that if multiple
  point features are accepted in one go (i.e.  in  'square  building'  mode)  then
  only  the  [3mFIRST[0m of those features will contain the specified AC(s).  All of the
  features will contain any Standing AC, however.

  When FB 7 is pressed in MAIN mode, LASERAID  performs  a  'small  feature'  scan
  looking  for  closed  objects  which  are  smaller  than  the  size  of the scan
  (approximately 1 cm square on the LASERTRAK screen).   In  fact,  two  different
  types of small feature scan are available, line-mode and edge-mode; which one is
  selected is determined by the MODe value (1 or 0) of the line type  assigned  to
  FB 7 (see section 8.5).

  If the scan position was not ideal, the refresh box may be moved by means of the
  tracker  ball  and  another scan performed using ESF (FB 7).  It should be noted
  that at present only one small feature may be accepted in a single scan, despite
  the fact that several may be found.  The required feature may be chosen by means
  of NXE (FB 8) which cycles through the found objects,  and  accepted  using  END
  (FB 12).

  LASERAID has many 'parameters' which are used  to  control  the  line  following
  process and are stored in the patch file between sessions.  Most of these are of
  no interest to the ordinary user but the more important ones which may  have  to
  be  'tuned'  (usually  by the system or flow-line manager) in order to capture a
  new sort of map are listed below (see Appendix A and the on-line help for a more
  complete description of these and numerous other parameters).

  As may be seen, the parameters are  grouped  by  function  as  far  as  possible
  (although  there  are  some  grey areas - you will notice that WID and PIT occur
  twice, for example).  Some of the more important  parameters  are  described  in
  later sections; for more information see Appendix A and the on-line help.

  Another command, PPP (alias PUP), displays a subset of this list.   This  subset
  contains the 'primary' parameters which may be of interest to the ordinary user,
  allowing simple tuning operations to be performed (e.g.  selection of  edge-mode
  rather than line-mode line following).

  8.4  [3mLIMits[0m [3mAnd[0m [3mWeights[0m

  The LIMits and Weights are  a  set  of  miscellaneous  values  required  by  the
  line-following  algorithms.   Optimum values have been ascertained by Laser-Scan
  and users should not attempt to modify them unless so instructed by a Laser-Scan
  engineer.  The current values can be displayed by means of the PLW command.



  8.5  [3mLine[0m [3mTypes[0m

  LASERAID supports seven line types which may be assigned to the  six  MAIN  mode
  'start  feature'  buttons  (see  section  5.2).   Each type may have independent
  values for the line following parameters, and these  are  stored  in  the  'type
  table'.   The current type table may be examined by means of the PTY command (in
  CHECK or HELP mode).

  The following should be noted:

       1.  Function buttons can be set up to use different line types by means  of
           the  TYF  command  in HELP mode.  It is NOT the case that FB 1 must use
           type 1, etc.  (in fact this would not be sensible given the scan  WIDth
           of type 1).

       2.  Some line types are (at least partially) reserved, in  that  they  must
           have particular attributes.  These are:

           Type 1 - This must be a large scan (WID 63, ID about  1200,  PIT  about
           10)  using  line mode (MOD 1) without inverse polarity (INV 0).  Type 1
           is used everywhere that a large scan is  required  (e.g.   POINT  mode,
           small  feature scans, FINd/FUMble).  In some cases attributes are taken
           from another type, with type 1 merely used to set the scan  size.   The
           prime  example  of this is small feature capture, where the MODe of the
           type assigned to FB7 determines whether edge-mode  or  line-mode  small
           feature is used (see section 7.3).

           Type 2 - This must be capable of following a normal line, as it is used
           for measuring the control points etc.  (MOD 1, INV 0, sensible WID).

           Type 7 - The WIDth and PITch of this type are used to set the  size  of
           junction  scans.   If  INV  is  in the type table, that will be used as
           well.  Other than that type 7 may be used at will.


  Types 3 to 6 are completely user-definable.

            PTY            print line types
            PAR n xxx      make xxx a type dependent parameter occupying slot n.
            SET n r1 ..r7  set the values of slot n to r1  ...   r7  (if  too  few
                           values are given the remaining entries are zeroed)
            VAR n1 n2 r    set the value of slot n1 for type n2 to r

  In order to avoid accidental modification of the type table, the command  ADJust
  must be given before SET, VAR and PAR.

  Whether LASERAID follows edges or lines (and performs the appropriate  paintout)
  is, by default, determined solely by the MODe value of the line type assigned to
  the starting function button  used.   MOD  1  indicates  line  mode  and  MOD  0
  indicates  edge  mode.  The current following mode may be examined by typing PPP
  (Print Primary Parameters); +ELF indicating edge following and  -ELF  indicating
  line following.

  In fact, the command ELF may be placed in the type tables (after MOD)  to  force
  the  following  strategy, but this mechanism is only likely to be of interest to
  Laser-Scan engineers.

  Junction line types should specify appropriate values for JNC (e.g.  3) and  SPD
  (e.g.  -300).  INI should also be set to 25 (rather than 15).



  8.6  [3mJunction[0m [3mParameters[0m

  The following parameters are available for controlling junction recognition:

       1.  JNC n - junction recognition

           This is a switch to enable or  disable  junction  recognition.   It  is
           bitwise decoded as follows:

           Assuming a starting value of zero,
           Add 1 if junction recognition is required at all, then
           Add 2 if the program should accept the junction automatically, then
           Add 4  if  the  program  should  NOT  automatically  snap  to  existing
           junctions, but should perform a complete junction scan each time.

           The most usual settings are:
           JNC 0 - junctions disabled
           JNC 3 - junctions enabled, 'auto-accept-and-go' enabled


  LASERAID - the Laser-Scan Digitiser                                      Page 36


           Another useful setting is JNC 2.  In this state, FPJ  (FB 13)  in  HELP
           mode   will   turn   junction   recognition   on   or   off,   enabling
           'auto-accept-and-go' at the same time.

       2.  CRS - Behaviour at 'Crossings'

           Specifying CRS -1/0/+1 causes  LASERAID  to  try  to  go  left/straight
           on/right when a junction is found.  This can be used, for example, when
           capturing polygon data to cause each polygon to be  followed  in  turn.
           If  'auto-accept-and-go'  is enabled (see above), the selected arm will
           be accepted automatically and digitising will continue.

       3.  JPT - Junction Position Tolerance

           This may be thought of as the 'radius of influence' of  each  junction.
           If two junctions are found which are closer together than JPT then they
           are pulled together to form  one  junction.   Also,  when  locating  an
           existing  junction,  if  the  LASERTRAK  cursor  is  within  JPT of the
           junction then it is found.

           The value of JPT should be approximately (say within a  factor  of  two
           of)  the  mean  linewidth  in HRD counts.  If JPT is too small LASERAID
           will have problems 'snapping' and locating  junctions;  if  it  is  too
           large  then  the wrong junction may be found and close junctions may be
           erroneously merged.

       4.  JAT - Junction arm Angle Tolerance

           This is used to decide which of the junction arms matches  the  current
           track.

           JAT is usually 40 degrees.

       5.  JWT - Junction arm-Width Tolerance

           A junction is not spotted if the line width falls below JWT  times  the
           current  track  width.  This reduces 'flapping' (searching for spurious
           junctions) in poor quality data where the linework may contain holes.

           A typical value for JWT is 0.3; setting it to 0.0 disables  this  check
           completely.   Note  that  the  junction  spotting  success rate will be
           severely reduced if JWT is larger than about 0.8.

       6.  SPD - Suppress Paintout Distance

           In order to 'spot' a previously measured junction when line  following,
           a small amount of each captured arm must be left unpainted.  The amount
           which must be left depends on whether junction 'snapping'  is  enabled.
           If  a full junction scan must be performed every time (JNC greater than
           4) a fairly large region must be left (SPD 300 might be  typical).   If
           'snapping'  is enabled (JNC less than 4), LASERAID is able to choose an
           appropriate paintout gap automatically.  This mechanism is  invoked  by
           setting  SPD  negative  (usually  the existing value is simply negated,
           e.g.  SPD -300).  The units are HRD counts (microns).

  8.7  [3mChain[0m [3mQuality[0m

  One of the most complicated areas of LASERAID tuning relates to the  concept  of
  chain  quality.   During the line-following process the LASERTRAK encounters are
  'grown' into chain elements, and these are then appended together to  produce  a
  continuous  track.   In  fact,  for  unbroken  lines  this is now a well-defined
  process for  data  within  a  individual  scan.   The  uncertainty  arises  when
  appending  data  from  different  scans, or when the original line is fragmented
  (e.g.  a pecked line).   In  such  cases,  each  chain  element  is  assigned  a
  'quality', and the one with the highest quality is appended.

  Consider a chain element which has a length 'len', width 'wid',  is  a  distance
  'dis' from the current end of the track and makes an angle 'ang' with the track.
  The quality of the element is then related to:

       LEN*('len'/(SMA*PIT))**2  +  ANG*(cos('ang'))  -
       DST*('dis'/GAP)**2        -  WTH*(('wid'-trackwidth)/trackwidth)


  The quantities LEN, ANG etc.  were introduced earlier.  As may be seen, this  is
  a rather complex function, but the important thing to remember is that a BALANCE
  should be maintained.  If you want to favour the nearest chain element then  DST
  can  be increased, but you should also consider altering one of the other values
  to prevent the overall quality from being  reduced  too  much  (if  the  quality
  becomes too small LASERAID will refuse to append anything).

  The 'Z' command macro performs a scan and lists the chain elements and qualities
  (refer  to  the  on-line  help for more information).  This can be a useful tool
  when tuning LASERAID to follow awkward or poor quality data.  Command macros are
  discussed in section 9.



  8.8  [3mVAX[0m [3mPriority[0m [3mSettings[0m

  The priority at which various LASERAID functions are performed may be set by the
  user  (assuming  he  has the necessary quotas) by means of the commands FPR, PPR
  and WPR.  These determine the priorities for Following,  Paint-out  and  Waiting
  (rolling  the tracker ball, etc).  If these are not set in the patch file, or if
  they are outside the range 1 to 10, they are set to the processes  current  base
  priority.   It  is  suggested  that  FPR  and  PPR  should  be set to 4 (the VAX
  default), and WPR to 5 (to give good interactive  response).   For  faster  line
  following  (at the expense of other users) FPR may be increased to 5.  It is not
  recommended that PPR be increased.

  9  [3mCOMMAND[0m [3mMACROS[0m

  Many  LASERAID  commands  in  HELP  mode  are,  in  fact,  macros   (groups   of
  'fundamental'  commands).   Some  of these are invoked directly by the user (via
  function buttons or keyboard commands); the rest are called by other  macros  or
  by the program itself.  The fundamental commands (or 'macro components') perform
  individual operations such as predicting the next scan direction, performing the
  scan, analysing the machine encounters and so on.

  The operation of the macros is usually of no concern to the  user,  hence  these
  commands  are only described in this document if they appear on function buttons
  (e.g.  the macro 'BB' which enables the LASERTRAK cursor to be rolled along  the
  current feature).  Additional information on specific macros is available in the
  on-line help.

  At present 35 macro 'slots' are available in LASERAID; all of these are reserved
  for  Laser-Scan.   Macros  which  are  currently  unused are given names such as
  'AAA', 'BBB' etc.  These commands appear in the list obtained by typing  '?'  in
  HELP  mode  but  are  not shown by the PMA (Print MAcros) command.  It should be
  noted that user-definition of macros is not supported, and no attempt should  be
  made to modify the standard macros provided by Laser-Scan.

  10  [3mPRE-GUIDANCE[0m

  Pre-guidance is a means whereby increased throughput  may  be  obtained  from  a
  LASERTRAK  by  having  most  of  the  operator-dependent  actions  (selection of
  feature, setting of NF and feature code, typing of TCs etc.)  done  offline  and
  stored in an IFF file to be used to 'guide' the automatic digitisation of a map.



  10.1  [3mThe[0m [3mGuidance[0m [3mFile[0m

  This is an IFF file and is identical to a normal IFF file  used  for  map  data,
  except  that there is usually only one data point for each feature (if more than
  one data point is present then the mean position is used, hence an ordinary data
  file  can  be  used  as  a test guidance file).  Guidance files will normally be
  produced using a digitising table.

  Each feature should contain the following:

       1.  NF Number - this is treated as you would expect.  It sets the NF number
           of the feature.

       2.  Feature code (first word of FS entry) - this is not copied by  LASERAID
           but  is  used to select both a line following 'type' and a real feature
           code from a table.  The feature type  is  necessary  because  LASERTRAK
           needs  to  know  what  sort of feature it is to digitise (smooth curve,
           small feature, point feature and so on).  The  LASERTRAK  operator  can
           allocate meanings to the feature codes in the guidance file by means of
           the GFC command .

       3.  One or more data points (ST entry) - this indicates, to  the  LASERTRAK
           operator,  which  feature  to  measure next.  If more than one point is
           given, they are averaged to produce a mean position.  The point  should
           therefore  be  chosen  to  avoid  any  ambiguity  and  should  also (if
           possible) be chosen to be a suitable place on the feature for LASERTRAK
           to  start digitising it automatically.  The data points in the guidance
           file should be expressed in the same units, and with the  same  control
           points, as the map in the LASERTRAK.

       4.  Any necessary TCs, which are entered in the usual way.


  Various entries in the  guidance  file  correspond  to  commands  given  by  the
  operator to the LASERTRAK:

  (or  giving  the  equivalent  command  - GNF) will cause the guidance file to be
  accessed, rather than the 'in-core junction list' (see section 7.1.1).  Commands
  will be read from the file until an EF entry is encountered.  At this point:

       1.  the NF number will be set

       2.  the cursor will be on the feature

       3.  one of the six function buttons (1, 2, 3, 5, 6  or  7)  used  to  start
           digitising  a feature will be lit to indicate to the operator what sort
           of feature it is.  It should be noted that this is purely advisory; the
           operator can press ANY of the six buttons to digitise the feature.


  When a feature has been digitised, it can be accepted or abandoned in the  usual
  way.   Pressing  FB 8  will  get the next feature to be measured.  Pressing FB 8
  repeatedly  will  fetch  successive  pre-digitisings  from  the   file,   though
  alternatively  the  SKIp  command  will  skip  through the guidance file until a
  particular NF is reached.

  The speed of operation using pre-guidance can be increased by  use  of  the  VFG
  option.   This  is  enabled  by  the  command VFG 1 and disabled by VFG 0.  When
  enabled it has the effect that  when  a  feature  has  been  accepted,  commands
  continue  to  be taken from the guidance file (as if FB 8 had been pressed).  On
  the other hand, if a feature is abandoned  or  the  check  fiducial  measurement
  fails  then  commands are taken from the operator in the normal way to allow the
  feature to be remeasured, cancelled etc.

            GUIde <file>   close any currently open guidance file and,  if  <file>
                           is given, open file LSL$GU:file.IFF.

            GNF (FB 8)     (Get Next Feature) Commands are read from the  guidance
                           file  until  an  EF  entry is found, at which point all
                           necessary information (NF, feature code, position etc.)
                           will   be  present  to  allow  the  operator  to  start
                           measuring the feature.

            VFG [n [r]]    controls the Very Fast Guidance option.  The option  is
                           enabled  if  the  integer  argument  n is non-zero, and
                           disabled if is zero or absent.  The very fast  guidance
                           option has two effects:

                           1.  when a feature is accepted,  the  next  feature  is
                               automatically fetched from the guidance file.

                           2.  when a feature has been fetched from  the  guidance
                               file,  one of the six 'feature select' buttons will
                               be lit.  If 'automatic starting' has been  enabled,
                               the  command  corresponding  to this button will be
                               given automatically after  a  short  time.   Typing
                               another  command,  pressing  a  function  button or
                               moving the tracker  ball  will  stop  this  command
                               being  given.   The  time delay for this command is
                               defined by the second (real) argument for VFG.   If
                               this  number  is  positive  it  enables  'automatic
                               starting' and sets the  time  delay  (expressed  in
                               seconds).   If  the  number  is  negative  then the
                               option is disabled.  If no second argument is given
                               the  time  delay  is  left as it was, regardless of
                               what the first argument is.  Thus:

                                  VFG 1 0.5 - enable option and set delay to  half
                                              a second
                                  VFG 0     - disable option
                                  VFG 1     - re-enable with same delay as before

            NXG            Gets the NeXt Guidance command from the file and  obeys
                           it.   This  is  only  for  testing  the system, and for
                           examining the effect of  each  entry  in  the  guidance
                           file.

            SKI [n]        skip all items in guidance file, up to  NF  n,  or  the
                           next  feature.   The  correct layer number will be set.
                           If no such NF entry is found, the guidance file is left
                           positioned where it was and an error message is output.

            GFC [n [m]]    arrange for feature code n in the guidance file to mean
                           that  FB m  should  be  used  to  start  measuring  the
                           feature.  The line type and feature  code  assigned  to
                           the  feature  will  depend  on which button is actually
                           used.  If m is absent then feature code  n  is  removed
                           from  the  table.   If both n and m are absent then the
                           table is typed.
