  Insert the negative in the film holder with the numbers back to front,  so  that
  they  are  the right way round on the projected image.  Invoke LASERAID with the
  command:

  LAJ FRED WITH <patchfile>

  Go into CHECK mode by typing:

  CHK

  and set up phase, threshold, etc.

  Exit CHECK mode (FB 16) and type:

  CAL 40

  The program will display in refresh "Upper right".

  Move the cursor to the top rightmost grid intersection and press FB 4.

  The program will display in refresh "Lower left".

  Move the cursor to the bottom leftmost grid intersection and press FB 4.

  The program will display in refresh "X step".

  Move the cursor to the grid intersection one to the  right  of  the  lower  left
  intersection and press FB 4.

  The program will display in refresh "Y step".

  Move the cursor to the grid intersection one above the lower  left  intersection
  and press FB 4.

  The program will then scan the lower left intersection.  If it then displays the
  message  "Manual  measure  please",  press  FB 2 a few times to repeat automatic
  scanning.  If this still fails, press FB 8 to draw a facsimile on  the  close-up
  screen,  position  the cross-hairs over the intersection of the lines, and press
  the space bar.  If nothing recognisable was drawn, exit by  pressing  FB 16  and
  re-enter   CHECK   mode.    If  the  program  stops  after  scanning  the  first
  intersection, without displaying a  message,  press  FB 13,  and  then  FB 4  to
  continue.   The program should now proceed automatically.  If it stops, try FB 2
  and FB 8 to find the intersection, followed by FB 13 to reset automatic continue
  and  FB 4  to  go.   The  program will draw crosses on the close-up screen as it
  progresses.

  To summarise, the function buttons are:


                  ... AUT ... OK
                  ... ... ... MAN
                  ... ... ... SKI
                  CON ... ... NO

  where:
                  AUT is automatic measure
                  OK  accepts a measurement
                  MAN draws on the close-up screen for manual measure
                  SKI skips an unmeasurable point
                  CON switches auto continue on/off
                  NO  abandons everything


  When the grid has been measured, the program will print out the RMS and  maximum
  residuals  and then display "OK ?".  The residuals should not be more than about
  8 for the two RMS values and 25 for the  two  maximum  values.   Press  FB 4  to
  accept  the  calibration  or  FB 16  to reject it.  The program may then display
  "After how many features ?".  If so, type:

  100

  to this and also to the following prompt - "Maximum permitted error ?".


                                                                            Page 3


  Now type:

  CP

  The cursor will now move to the top left of the  screen.   Position  the  cursor
  over  the  intersection  8 above the lower left intersection, press FB 2 to scan
  the intersection, and type:

  0 320

  to give the co-ordinates of the point, and FB 4 to accept it.  Repeat with:

  0 0

  for the lower left,

  400 0

  for the intersection 10 to the right of the lower left, and

  400 320

  for the intersection 10 to the right and 8 up.

  Press FB 4 in answer to the prompt "OK?", and type:

  0

  in answer to the prompt "Which point as fiducial ?"

  Then type:

  LAY 1

  For each numbered cross on the negative, type:

  NF n

  where n is the number next to the cross.  The number will appear in refresh next
  to  the cursor, and then press FB 6 to scan the cross.  The program will display
  in refresh a point at the centre of the cross.  Press FB 2 to repeat,  FB 12  to
  draw on the close-up screen and FB 4 to accept.

  Type:

  EOS

  to exit LASERAID.

  To process the file, type:

  LAPROCESS FRED

  ITOTEXT FRED/PRINT

  to spool the file to the line printer, or

  ITOTEXT FRED SYS$OUTPUT:

  to type it on the terminal.
