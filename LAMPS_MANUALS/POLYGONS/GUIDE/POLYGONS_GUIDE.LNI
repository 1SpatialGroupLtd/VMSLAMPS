            The POLYGONS package consists of independent  modules  which  together
            form a powerful IFF polygon creation and manipulation system within an
            automated mapping environment.  All the modules  have  common  command
            syntax which is decoded using the Command Line Interpreter used by the
            VAX/VMS utilities.  POLYGONS modules all generate VMS format  messages
            and  set  $STATUS  on  image  exit.  In command files the success of a
            preceding  POLYGONS  module  may  be  tested  using   $STATUS   before
            proceeding.   All  POLYGONS  modules are comprehensively documented in
            the POLYGONS  Reference  Manual  and  the  documentation  includes  an
            explanation  of  all  messages  output  by  the  modules together with
            suggested user action.  POLYGONS is supplied with on-line  help  which
            is available via the VAX/VMS HELP utility.

            It is recommended that  the  user  becomes  familiar  with  the  LAMPS
            Environment  Guide  which  outlines  in  some  detail the hardware and
            software environment required by the LAMPS  package  as  a  whole  (of
            which  POLYGONS is but a part).  LAMPS is the [1mL[0maser-Scan [1mA[0mutomated [1mM[0map
            [1mP[0mroduction [1mS[0mystem.  Readers are also referred  to  the  collection  of
            manuals  on  VMS  produced  by  Digital  Equipment Corporation for the
            detailed command structure and facilities.

            IFF stands for Internal Feature File and is the Laser-Scan vector file
            format  generated by LASERAID and other Laser-Scan mapping systems and
            used as the data structure throughout  the  Laser-Scan  LAMPS  system.
            IFF  files  are binary and cannot be manipulated directly using a text
            editor.  The POLYGONS package enables the user to perform a wide range
            of polygon creation and manipulation tasks related to the requirements
            of the automated mapping industry.   Within  the  VAX/VMS  system  IFF
            files  can  be  treated  as  any  other  file type for file management
            purposes.  To enable the user to instantly  distinguish  an  IFF  file
            from  a  file  of  another  type  IFF  files  have by default the file
            extension '.IFF'.

            To provide great flexibility in the production environment  IFF  files
            are referenced by all the POLYGONS modules using logical name LSL$IF:.
            (For an explanation of logical names see the  VAX/VMS  document  set).
            Logical   name   LSL$IF:   is  assigned  to  a  device  and  directory
            specification either using the VMS ASSIGN command or the Laser-Scan SI
            utility.  Use of the SI utility is described in detail in the IFF User
            Guide.  Familiarisation with its use is strongly recommended.

            Once logged in the user must  give  two  commands  to  initialise  the
            POLYGONS  package  before  any  IFF  manipulation can take place.  The
            first command is POLYGONSINI and should be issued thus:  (see footnote
            for explanation of presentation conventions)

                      $ [1mPOLYGONSINI[0m

            The POLYGONSINI command invokes a command procedure  which  defines  a
            DCL  symbol (the module name) for each of the POLYGONS modules.  After
            using POLYGONSINI the user need only type the symbol name to  activate
            the module of his choice.  POLYGONSINI also installs process dependent
            POLYGONS message definitions.  These allow the  user  to  examine  the
            text represented by the condition code placed in DCL symbol $STATUS by
            all POLYGONS modules on image exit.

            As an alternative to explicitly typing the  POLYGONSINI  command  each
            time  the  user  wishes  to  use the POLYGONS package, the POLYGONSINI
            command may be placed  in  the  users  login  file,  or  in  the  site
            dependent default login file.

            The second command which must  be  given  before  using  the  POLYGONS
            package  is  the  SI command.  The SI command assigns the logical name
            LSL$IF:  (or IF:  for short)  to  the  device-directory  specification
            which  contains  the  IFF  file(s)  that  are  to be manipulated.  For
            example:

                      $ [1mSI[0m [1mDUA3:[BUREAU.TRIALS.DIGITISING][0m

            This will assign logical name LSL$IF:  to  the  device  and  directory
            specification DUA3:[BUREAU.TRIALS.DIGITISING]

            The POLYGONS User Guide is not intended to be a  definitive  reference
            manual  describing  in  detail  all  the  qualifiers  to each POLYGONS
            command, each modules functionality and restrictions etc.   This  role
            is  met  by  the  POLYGONS  Reference  Manual.   Instead this document
            describes only the salient  features  of  each  POLYGONS  module.   It

  The dollar symbol '$' is the default DCL prompt and signifies to the  user  that
  the  computer  is  prompting  for  DCL  commands.   At this stage, any legal VMS
  command or appropriate Laser-Scan command can be entered as required.

  The convention in all POLYGONS documents is that [1mbold[0m  type  which  follows  the
  dollar prompt in an example command line indicates text that the user has typed.

  the POLYGONS documentation see SECTION I of the POLYGONS Reference Manual.

            should  be  regarded as a statement of package scope and content.  The
            POLYGONS  User  Guide  should  be  used  for  the  initial  stages  of
            production  flowline planning or as an aid memoir for skilled POLYGONS
            users.

            The modules are described in alphabetical order.  Each  module  has  a
            very  brief  section  outlining  its  functionality, the format of the
            command  used  to  invoke  the  module  and  a  list  of  any  command
            qualifiers.

  [1mFUNCTION[0m

            IPOLYGON  is  the  Laser-Scan  automatic  [1mI[0mFF  [1mPOLYGON[0m  creation   and
            labelling  utility.   It  forms  the  core  of the Laser-Scan POLYGONS
            Package.

            IPOLYGON is designed to be run in batch mode and all  options  may  be
            specified on the command line.  No user interaction is required during
            processing.

            IPOLYGON carries out polygon formation and the determination of  first
            order nesting based on the input geometry.

            IPOLYGON  offers  two  methods  for  labelling   (and   checking   the
            consistency) of polygons:

             o  Seed point assignment:  the polygon label is  extracted  from  the
                seed point data.

             o  Left/Right  coding:   each  segment  has  a  left  and  right   AC
                (Ancillary  Code).   The  polygon label is extracted from the text
                part of the AC.


            In  addition  IPOLYGON  provides  a  unique   (internally   generated)
            identifier for each polygon.

            IPOLYGON offers four methods of polygon output:

             o  An  IFF  file  containing  complete  closed  polygons  as   single
                features.

             o  An IFF file containing labelled segments with left/right codes.

             o  An IFF file containing  a  single  point  feature  lying  in  each
                polygon.

             o  An ASCII file containing lists of  those  segments  that  make  up
                polygons.


            All output options allow the label and/or identifier for each  polygon
            to  be output to the IFF features through the use of user-specified AC
            (Ancillary Code) entries.

            ISTSEL is the Laser-Scan [1mI[0mFF [1mST[0mring [1mSEL[0mection utility and  forms  part
            of  the  Laser-Scan  POLYGONS  Package.   ISTSEL reads an IFF file and
            compares text strings held as AC (Ancillary Code) left/right codes and
            TX (TeXt) entries to keys given in a user specified lookup file.

            If a match is found between the IFF text string and any of the keys in
            the  lookup file then the left/right code is replaced with the matched
            key defined in the lookup file.  After  left/right  code  replacement,
            segments  with  identical  left/right codes are identified and are not
            written to the  output  IFF  file.   This  provides  ISTSEL  with  the
            mechanism   for   segment   selection   and  hence  selective  polygon
            aggregation.

  [1mFUNCTION[0m

            POLMERGE  is  the  Laser-Scan  automatic  IFF  [1mPOL[0mYGON   [1mMERG[0ming   and
            elimination utility.

            POLMERGE is designed to be run in batch mode and all  options  may  be
            specified on the command line.  No user interaction is required during
            processing.

            POLMERGE operates on an IFF junction structured (IFJ) file  containing
            left/right  coded  links.   Because  output is also to an IFJ file the
            program may be used as a pre-processor before closed polygon  creation
            using IPOLYGON.

            Polygon merging takes place by means of user-defined  rules.   Both  a
            lookup  table and command line qualifiers may be incorporated in their
            definition.
