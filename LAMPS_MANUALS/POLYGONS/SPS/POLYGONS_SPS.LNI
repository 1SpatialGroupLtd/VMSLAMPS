  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan IFF polygon processing package  (POLYGONS)  operates  on  Digital
  Equipment VAX, and Alpha AXP series computers running the VMS operating systems.
  See later sections for details of hardware and software  prerequisites.   It  is
  recommended  that the reader becomes familiar with the "LAMPS Environment Guide"
  which outlines in some detail the hardware and software environment required  by
  the  LAMPS  package  as a whole (of which POLYGONS is but a part).  LAMPS is the
  [1mL[0maser-Scan [1mA[0mutomated [1mM[0map [1mP[0mroduction [1mS[0mystem.

  IFF stands for [1mI[0mnternal [1mF[0meature [1mF[0mormat and is the Laser-Scan vector file  format
  generated  by LASERAID and other Laser-Scan mapping systems and used as the data
  structure throughout the Laser-Scan LAMPS system.   IFF  files  are  binary  and
  cannot  be  manipulated  directly  using  a  text  editor.  The POLYGONS package
  enables the user to create and manipulate polygon data within IFF files.

  The POLYGONS package consists of  independent  modules  which  together  form  a
  powerful polygon creation and manipulation system within an automated mapping or
  GIS (Geographical Information System) environment.

  The POLYGONS package is designed for  use  in  conjunction  with  the  STRUCTURE
  package  module ILINK.  ILINK is used to provide link-node data structure within
  IFF files which is then used by the POLYGONS module IPOLYGON to  form  polygons.
  (See  the STRUCTURE package SPS for details of LINK and the "IFF User Guide" for
  details of IFF link-node strructure).

  All the POLYGONS modules have common command syntax which is decoded  using  the
  Command  Line  Interpreter  as  used by the VMS utilities.  POLYGONS modules all
  generate VMS format messages and set VMS DCL symbol $STATUS on image  exit.   In
  command  files  the  success  of a preceding POLYGONS module may be tested using
  $STATUS before proceeding.

  All POLYGONS modules  are  comprehensively  documented  in  the  "POLYGONS  User
  Reference  Manual"  and  the  documentation  includes an explanation of messages
  output by the modules together with suggested user action.  POLYGONS is supplied
  with on-line help which is available via the VMS HELP utility.

  POLYGONS is compatible with  the  'new'  type  of  IFF  files  produced  by  the
  Laser-Scan IMP (IFF MAP Processing) package.  (For a detailed description of IFF
  types and their component entries see the "IFF User Guide").

  Within the VMS system IFF files can be treated as any other file type  for  file
  management  purposes.  To enable the user to distinguish an IFF file from a file
  of another type IFF files  have  by  default  the  file  extension  '.IFF',  and
  link-node   structured  IFF  files  the  extension  '.IFJ'.   To  provide  great
  flexibility in the production environment IFF files are referenced  by  all  the
  POLYGONS  modules  using  logical  name LSL$IF:.  (For an explanation of logical
  names see the VMS document set).  Logical name LSL$IF:  is assigned to a  device
  and  directory  specification  either  using  the  VMS  DEFINE  command  or  the
  Laser-Scan SI utility.

  The facilities offered by POLYGONS are described by module in alphabetical order
  of module.



  [1m*[0m [1mIPOLYGON[0m (Polygon creation and labelling utility)

          IPOLYGON is the Laser-Scan automatic [1mI[0mFF [1mPOLYGON[0m creation and  labelling
          utility.  It forms the core of the Laser-Scan POLYGONS Package.

          IPOLYGON is designed to be run in batch mode  and  all  options  may  be
          specified  on  the command line.  No user interaction is required during
          processing.

          IPOLYGON carries out polygon formation and the  determination  of  first
          order  nesting  based on the input geometry.  Those segments that do not
          form part of a boundary between different polygons can be  automatically
          removed.

          IPOLYGON offers two methods for labelling (and checking the consistency)
          of polygons:

           o  Seed point assignment:  the polygon label is extracted from the seed
              point data.

           o  Left/Right coding:  each segment has a left and right AC  (Ancillary
              Code).  The polygon label is extracted from the text part of the AC.


          Geometry  is  analysed  to  any  required  level  of  nesting  for   the
          determination  of  seed point placement.  There are three mechanisms for
          extracting labels from seed points based on:  (a) the contents of  a  TX
          entry  within  the  seed  point, (b) the contents of the text field of a
          specified AC type or (c) generated from the FSN of the seed point.

          If left/right coded segments are used then labels are extracted from the
          text field of the specified left and right ACs.

          In addition IPOLYGON provides a unique (internally generated) identifier
          for each polygon.

          IPOLYGON offers four methods of polygon output, any combination of which
          may be output in a single run:

           o  An IFF file containing complete closed polygons as single features.

           o  An IFF file containing labelled segments with left/right codes.

           o  An IFF file containing a single point feature lying in each polygon.

           o  An ASCII file containing  lists  of  those  segments  that  make  up
              polygons.

          All output options allow the label and/or identifier for each polygon to
          be  output  to  the  IFF  features  through the use of user-specified AC
          (Ancillary Code) entries.

          The calculated area of polygons can be output to the  numeric  field  of
          label  and/or  identifier  ACs  of  polygon boundary or point-in-polygon
          features.

          Coded   output    segments    can    carry    either    left/right    or
          left/right/contained  labels  and/or identifiers.  Coded segments can be
          output to both IFF and junction-structured IFF files.

          Optionally, IPOLYGON  can  propagate  one  or  more  partial  left-right
          codings   of  input  segments.   This  has  a  number  of  applications,
          including:

           o  extension of a consistent but incomplete segment coding,

           o  labelling of linear features according to their containing  polygon,
              (line-in-polygon),

           o  mutual completion of  multiple  codings.   Together  with  geometric
              processing  available in the STRUCTURE package, this forms the basis
              of polygon overlay operations.

  [1m*[0m [1mISTSEL[0m (Segment selection and polygon aggregation utility)

          ISTSEL is the Laser-Scan [1mI[0mFF [1mST[0mring [1mSEL[0mection utility.  ISTSEL reads  an
          IFF  file  and  compares  text  strings held as left/right AC (Ancillary
          Code) entries and TX (TeXt) entries to keys given in  a  specified  text
          file.

          If a match is found between the IFF text string and any of the  keys  in
          the text file, then the code is replaced with the matched key defined in
          the text file.

          After recoding, segments with identical left/right codes are not written
          to  the  output  IFF  file.   The  overall effect of the program is thus
          segment selection and  this  provides  a  powerful  polygon  aggregation
          facility.

          The text strings used as  left/right  segment  labels  may  be  numeric,
          alphanumeric or alphabetic and may be up to 255 characters in length.

  [1m*[0m [1mPOLMERGE[0m (Polygon merging and elimination using multiple aggregation criteria)

          POLMERGE is the Laser-Scan automatic IFF [1mPOL[0mYGON [1mMERG[0ming and elimination
          utility.  It forms part of the Laser-Scan POLYGONS Package.

          POLMERGE is designed to be run in batch mode  and  all  options  may  be
          specified  on  the command line.  No user interaction is required during
          processing.

          POLMERGE operates on an IFF junction structured  (IFJ)  file  containing
          left/right coded links.  Because output is also to a junction structured
          IFF file, the program may be  used  as  a  pre-processor  before  closed
          polygon creation using IPOLYGON.

          Polygons may be merged or eliminated on the basis of:

           o  area

           o  coding rules read from a user specified ASCII lookup file

           o  relative polygon sizes - large into small, small into large

           o  numeric value of polygon code

           o  ratio of perimeter/area

  The prerequisite Laser-Scan STRUCTURE module ILINK provides the  link/node  data
  structure required by POLYGONS module IPOLYGON.

  The prerequisite Laser-Scan MAPPING package provides IFF and FRT file  interface
  libraries.

  The Laser-Scan LITES2 interactive digitising and editing software is recommended
  for  digitising vector input data.  The Laser-Scan LASERAID automated digitising
  system is recommended for large numbers of input documents.

  It is recommended that the reader becomes familiar with  the  LAMPS  Environment
  Guide  which  outlines  in  greater detail the hardware and software environment
  required by the LAMPS package as a whole (of which POLYGONS is but a part).

  The POLYGONS module IPOLYGON can only be used in conjunction with the  STRUCTURE
  package module ILINK.

  ILINK enables "idealisation"  of  IFF  geometry,  and/or  the  creation  of  IFF
  link-node structure from unstructured IFF data.  It is this latter ILINK feature
  which is required by IPOLYGON.

  The main functions of ILINK are:

        o  close feature section alignment,

        o  the creation of ideal junctions where features almost touch or cross,

        o  the creation of junctions where junctions are implied because  existing
           features already cross or touch,

  Each process uses working link to node and node to link pointers in  the  course
  of  its operation, incorporating every junction detected.  This structure can be
  discarded or retained in whole or in part in the IFF output.  The options are as
  follows:

        o  Ignore the link/node structure completely and  do  not  break  features
           into separate parts at junctions.

        o  Ignore link/node information, but break features into separate parts at
           every  junction  and  merge  duplicate  feature  sections  into  single
           features.

        o  Break and merge  features  as  above  and  also  retain  IFF  link-node
           structure data.

  Like IPOLYGON, ILINK  is  non-interactive  and  uses  no  graphics  devices.   A
  progress  display  can  be activated for the more time consuming operations when
  the program is run in interactive mode.  All warning messages and a  summary  of
  process statistics are written to SYS$OUTPUT.

  For more information on ILINK please see the separate STRUCTURE Software Product
  Specification (SPS).
