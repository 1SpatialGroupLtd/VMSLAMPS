  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document  describes  the  acceptance  test  procedure  for  the  Laser-Scan
  FLOWLINE  package.   It assumes that the user is familiar with the VMS operating
  system.  See the "FLOWLINE Reference Manual" for further information on  package
  FLOWLINE.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserve the right  to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.

  The  test  runs  by  using  the  LAMPSCONTROL  program  which  makes  use  of  a
  hierarchical  arrangement  of  screen  menus  and  requires  a  VT100 compatible
  terminal.  Movement of the cursor up and down menu options is achieved by  using
  the  [1mup[0m  [1mand[0m  [1mdown[0m  [1marrow[0m  keys  on the keyboard, while an option is selected by
  pressing the [1m<CR>[0m (carriage return key).   Certain  other  key  presses  may  be
  necessary  for  certain  operations.   These  are  described when necessary.  On
  certain occasions screen forms are displayed which require the input of data  on
  the screen.  Movement from field to field on forms is achieved using the [1mTAB[0m and
  [1mBS[0m (backspace) keys.

  The test runs on an example flowline (ACCEPT) shown in  figure  1.   The  actual
  flowline  operations  are performed by DCL command procedures.  For the purposes
  of the FLOWLINE acceptance test, however, these command files do not  carry  out
  any  processing.   The  user  may  however  be prompted to press the [1m<CR>[0m key to
  continue processing, or to answer a  question  to  indicate  the  next  flowline
  operation to be carried out, or to set up job-wide symbols.

  2.1  [1mInvoking[0m [1mThe[0m [1mPackage[0m

  Invoke  the  acceptance  test  command  procedure  by  giving  the  DCL  command
  "@LSL$COM:FLOWLINE_ACCEPT".   This  command  file  will  initialise the flowline
  package and check for the existence of the flowline database, then make  a  copy
  of  the  database  with  which  to  perform  the acceptance test.  Stored in the
  database is the ACCEPT flowline depicted in figure 1.  The current  operator  is
  authorised  to work on the database, on the current workstation.  Also stored in
  the database are projects and jobs in various states of completion to simulate a
  real production environment.

  On successful initialisation of the ACCEPT flowline, the LAMPSCONTROL program is
  invoked and the overall control menu displayed.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  3.1  [1mJob[0m [1mCreation[0m

  In this phase a job is launched on the ACCEPT flowline.

  Select the [1mManagement[0m [1mmenu[0m option on the  overall  control  menu.   The  various
  management  operations  are  shown  on the management menu.  Select the [1mCreation[0m
  [1m(project,[0m [1mjob)[0m option, followed by the [1mCreate[0m [1ma[0m [1mjob[0m option on the Creation Menu.
  A form is then displayed to allow a job to be launched on the system.  Move from
  field to field on the form using the [1mTAB[0m and [1mBS[0m (backspace) keys.  The fields on
  the form should be filled in as follows:  -

               Flowline Identifier   [1mACCEPT[0m
               Project  Identifier   [1mPROJECT_ACCEPT[0m
               Job Name              [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m
               Priority              [1m4[0m (default)

  Press [1m<CR>[0m to start the job creation process  when  all  the  fields  have  been
  filled in.  A generated "jacket" DCL command procedure is now invoked which sets
  up various DCL symbols which are used in tasks carried out for this job  on  the
  ACCEPT  flowline.   These symbols are set up in a command file which is specific
  to the job created.  The default values for  the  symbols  may  be  accepted  by
  pressing  [1m<CR>[0m  in  response  to  the  questions or user-specified values may be
  input.  Write down the values of the symbols for subsequent verification  during
  task invocation.

  On completion of the command file the LAMPSCONTROL program is again invoked  for
  further  operations.   Choose  the [1mProject,[0m [1mJob[0m [1mand[0m [1mTask[0m [1mRequest[0m [1mMenus[0m option on
  the overall control menu.  The Project Request Menu is then  displayed.   Select
  the [1mPROJECT_ACCEPT[0m project.  Verify that the Job ([1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m) that has just been
  launched is shown in the job request menu.  Select [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m.  Verify that  the
  first  two  elements  of the ACCEPT flowline are shown as available tasks on the
  Task request menu ([1mPROCESS_1[0m and [1mPROCESS_2[0m).

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  3.2  [1mTask[0m [1mInvocation[0m

  This phase of the acceptance test carries out the first two  tasks  of  the  job
  that has been launched.

  Select the [1mPROCESS_1[0m task.  A command procedure  is  generated  and  invoked  to
  carry out the flowline task.  Verify that the displayed values of the symbols 1,
  2 and 3 are the the same as those entered during the job creation phase.   Press
  [1m<CR>[0m  to  continue processing.  Note the message to indicate that the session on
  the task has been completed.

  On  task  completion  the  LAMPSCONTROL  program  is  again  invoked  in  normal
  interactive  mode.   Choose the [1mProject,[0m [1mJob[0m [1mand[0m [1mTask[0m [1mRequest[0m [1mMenus[0m option again
  on the overall control menu.  Note that on this occasion the next menu shown  is
  automatically  the  Task  Request  Menu for the current job.  Note also that the
  [1mPROCESS_1[0m task is no longer present.  Select the [1mPROCESS_2[0m task  and  repeat  as
  for  [1mPROCESS_1[0m.   On  the subsequent invocation of LAMPSCONTROL again select the
  [1mProject,[0m [1mJob[0m [1mand[0m [1mTask[0m [1mRequest[0m [1mMenus[0m option on the overall  control  menu.   Note
  that  the  [1mPROCESS_3[0m  task  is available to be carried out because [1mPROCESS_1[0m and
  [1mPROCESS_2[0m have both been completed.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.3  [1mJob[0m [1mControl[0m

  In this phase, the job is held to prevent further work from  taking  place,  and
  subsequently released.

  Move back to the overall control menu by selecting the [1mJump[0m [1mto[0m  [1mtop[0m  [1mlevel[0m  [1mmenu[0m

  control menu.  Note that [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m is no longer present on the job request menu
  of  [1mPROJECT_ACCEPT[0m thus preventing any further work being carried out on the job
  until it is subsequently released.  Move back to the  overall  control  menu  by
  selecting the [1mJump[0m [1mto[0m [1mtop[0m [1mlevel[0m [1mmenu[0m option.

  Select the [1mManagement[0m [1mMenu[0m option followed by the [1mStatus[0m [1mModification[0m  [1m(project,[0m
  [1mjob,[0m  [1mtask)[0m  option.  Select the [1mPROJECT_ACCEPT[0m project.  Move the cursor to the
  [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m job.  Press GOLD R (The PF1 key followed by R) to  release  the  job.
  Note  that the job status once again becomes "Active".  Move back to the overall
  control menu by selecting the  [1mJump[0m  [1mto[0m  [1mtop[0m  [1mlevel[0m  [1mmenu[0m  option.   Select  the
  [1mProject,[0m  [1mJob[0m  [1mand[0m  [1mTask[0m [1mRequest[0m [1mMenus[0m option on the overall control menu.  Note
  that the next menu displayed is the Task Request Menu for [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m, indicating
  that work may again be carried out on the job, and [1mPROCESS_3[0m is again available.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  All the tasks in the system are shown  by  selecting  the  [1mTasks[0m  [1mstatus[0m  [1mreport[0m
  option.  Verify that the [1mPROCESS_3[0m task in [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m is present on the list.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.5  [1mJob[0m [1mCompletion[0m

  In the the final phase of the test the remaining tasks in [1mJOB_ACCEPT[0m are carried
  out  and  the loop in the ACCEPT flowline is also activated.  The job is finally
  completed when the final task is completed.

  Move back to the overall control menu by selecting the [1mJump[0m [1mto[0m  [1mtop[0m  [1mlevel[0m  [1mmenu[0m
