            FLOWLINE is the Laser-Scan flowline database and control  package  and
            provides  a  flexible  system  for  the management of a computer based
            flowline.  Flowline operations are carried out by means of DCL command
            procedures.   These  command procedures are created independently from
            flowline database definition.  Thus the system is not restricted to  a
            specific  application,  and indeed may be used to manage more than one
            flowline   simultaneously.    The   system   is   designed   for   the
            implementation  of  flowlines using Laser-Scan LAMPS mapping software,
            but is sufficiently general to control any flowline driven  using  DCL
            command procedures.

            The FLOWLINE package consists of the the relational database  FLOWLINE
            and  the module LAMPSCONTROL.  All management and operator interaction
            with the database may be achieved using LAMPSCONTROL.   The  following
            features are offered:

             o  automatic recording  of  the  start  and  completion  of  flowline
                operations

             o  operator selection from available flowline tasks

             o  extensive flowline management facilities

             o  full reporting facilities of flowline status and performance

             o  menu and command qualifier input

             o  VMS format messages referenced using 32 bit condition code symbols

             o  assured database integrity, in the event of a system crash

             o  A DCL  command  file  structure  which  enables  the  creation  of
                flowlines  which  minimise the need for interactive operator input
                of information such as data file names, and program  command  line
                qualifiers.

             o  error recovery procedures

             o  flexible operator and workstation authorisation facilities

  [1mFLOWLINE[0m [1mand[0m [1mVAX[0m [1mRdb/VMS[0m

            The system runs under the VAX/VMS operating system and  uses  the  DEC
            relational  database  system  VAX/Rdb.   On system installation an Rdb
            FLOWLINE  database  is  created  to  store   all   flowline   specific
            information.   The  database  consists of two files, the main database
            (FLOWLINE.RDB) and the snapshot file (FLOWLINE.SNP) which is  used  to
            increase  the  speed of read-only operations.  Both these files are by
            default resident in the same directory but optionally may be placed on
            separate disks to reduce potential access conflict.

            Check that these files exist by giving the command:

                  $ [1mDIRECTORY[0m [1mLSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.GENERAL.DATABASE]<CR>[0m

            If the files do not exist then they may  be  created  by  issuing  the
            command:-

                  $ [1m@LSL$COM:FLOWLINE_DB_CREATE<CR>[0m

            which will  create  an  empty  database,  and  authorise  the  current
            operator    and   workstation   to   use   it.    The   logical   name
            LSL$FLN_WORKSTATION must be defined as the name of the workstation  to
            authorise before executing the command file.

            Rdb may operate in a VAX cluster environment.  This  has  the  obvious
            advantage  to  the  FLOWLINE  system  of allowing operators working on
            different nodes of the cluster to access the same copy of the flowline
            database.

            Screen menus and forms are used which make use of the form  management
            system VAX/FMS.

            Once logged in the user must  give  two  commands  to  initialise  the
            FLOWLINE package.  Before the FLOWLINE package can be used DCL symbols
            and logical names must be assigned to enable the user to  operate  the
            system.      This     is    done    using    a    command    procedure
            LSL$COM:FLOWLINEINI.COM which is supplied  as  part  of  the  FLOWLINE
            package.   FLOWLINEINI  should  be invoked thus:  (see the PREFACE for
            explanation of presentation conventions)

                  $ [1m@LSL$COM:FLOWLINEINI[0m [1mroot[0m [1mcustomer[0m [1mflowline...<CR>[0m

            The FLOWLINEINI command file expects at least 3 parameters.

            1.  'root' specifies the name of the directory structure in which  the
                read-only  flowline  command  files are found - it will usually be
                either PUBLIC or SITE.

            2.  'customer' specifies the names of  directories  specific  to  this
                installation  of the flowline package - it will be the name of the
                customer site.

  Getting started with FLOWLINE                                    21 January 1993


            3.  'flowline' is the name of a particular flowline within the  system
                -  it  is used in some logical names and directory names.  Up to 6
                'flowline' parameters may be given.


            The FLOWLINEINI command procedure defines a  DCL  symbol  (the  module
            name)  for  the LAMPSCONTROL module.  After using FLOWLINEINI the user
            need only type the symbol name to activate the LAMPSCONTROL module.

            The command file also sets up various logical  names,  that  are  used
            within the system to reference the various files, as follows:  -

            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_DATABASE -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.'customer'.DATABASE]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_WORK -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.'customer'.WORK]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_LOG -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.'customer'.LOG]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_PROJECT -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.'customer'.PROJECT]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_LOGIN -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.'customer'.LOGIN]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_JACKET -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.'customer'.JACKET]

            The FLOWLINEINI command file will fail if these directories  have  not
            previously been created.

            For each of the (1 to 6) flowline names given, logical names  will  be
            defined  to reflect a directory structure for the particular flowline,
            e.g. :-

                  $ [1mFLOWLINEINI[0m [1mroot[0m [1mcustomer[0m [1mDIGITISE<CR>[0m 

            carries out the following logical name assignments: -

            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_DIGITISE_SITE - 
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:['customer'.FLOWLINE.DIGITISE.SITE]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_DIGITISE_ELEMENT - 
                  LSL$'root'_ROOT:['customer'.FLOWLINE.DIGITISE.ELEMENT]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_DIGITISE_PROCEDURE -
                  LSL$'root'_ROOT:['customer'.FLOWLINE.DIGITISE.PROCEDURE]
            $ DEFINE LSL$FLN_DIGITISE_JOB -
                  LSL$SITE_ROOT:['customer'.FLOWLINE.DIGITISE.JOB], -
                  LSL$'root'_ROOT:['customer'.FLOWLINE.DIGITISE.JOB]

            The logical name LSL$FLN_DIGITISE_COM is  defined  as  a  search  list
            which  points  to all four directories.  These directories may be used
            to  store  the  relevant  command  files  for  a  specific   flowline.
            FLOWLINEINI  requires  that  these  directories  are  created  for the
            logical name definition to succeed.

            The intention of this directory  structure  is  that  the  directories
            LSL$'root'_ROOT:['customer'.FLOWLINE.'flowline_name'...]  contain  the
            definition of the flowline, and may be protected aginst write  access.
            (These  files  may well be on LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT if the flowline has been

            designed and supplied by Laser-Scan, rather than by the customer.) The
            other  directories  are  written  to  during  day-to-day  use  of  the
            flowline, and should not be protected.

            As an alternative to explicitly typing the  FLOWLINEINI  command  each
            time  the  user  wishes  to  use the FLOWLINE package, the FLOWLINEINI
            command may be placed  in  the  users  login  file,  or  in  the  site
            dependent default login file.

            Once the flowline  system  has  been  established  on  your  site,  an
            operator's LOGIN.COM file is normally be set up to loop continually to
            run the LAMPSCONTROL program.   Thus,  for  example  the  operator  on
            login, will be presented immediately with a list of tasks which he may
            immediately perform on the system.   Once  his  session  is  complete,
            LAMPSCONTROL is again invoked to offer more tasks which may be carried
            out.  The LAMPSCONTROL program itself offers the option of logging out
            of the system.

            More on the various DCL command files  associated  with  the  FLOWLINE
            system is contained in chapter 4.

            Because flowline  operations  are  carried  out  by  manager  designed
            command procedures, there is no restriction on the type of application
            which may be carried out using the system.

            Laser-Scan mapping software (LAMPS) is however, particularly  suitable
            for  integration into a well defined flowline for applications such as
            map digitising and editing or digital terrain modelling.

  [1mIntroduction[0m

            The flowline control system utilises Digital  Equipment  Corporation's
            relational  database  system  VAX  Rdb/VMS.   Flowline  information is
            stored in a FLOWLINE database which is created on system installation.
            This  database  is situated in the directory referenced by the logical
            name LSL$FLN_DATABASE

            Operators  and  managers  interact  with  the   database   using   the
            LAMPSCONTROL program, which is described in Chapter 5.

            The design of a production flowline is by nature  a  complex  process.
            Very  often  several design iterations will be required to produce the
            final  result.   Even  when  a  flowline  has  been   established   in
            production, it may be required to be modified in the light of changing
            circumstances, such as increased operator  proficiency,  or  differing
            requirements.

            It is beyond the scope of this document to describe the methodology of
            flowline  design.  This chapter describes the concepts necessary for a
            flowline, once designed, to be defined in the  FLOWLINE  database  and
            manipulated by the LAMPSCONTROL program.

            Throughout this document various terms are used to describe  types  of
            information stored in the database.  These are defined in detail below
            with reference to the example DIGITISE  flowline  (Figure  2.1)  which
            represents  a  simple  map  digitising  process.   Words  in bold type
            reference terms defined elsewhere.  A full  list  of  the  information
            stored in the database relations is given in Appendix A.

            The  final  section  of  this  chapter  describes   general   flowline
            definition procedures.

  [1mFlowline[0m

            A flowline is a well defined, independent sequence of operations which
            is  designed to perform a [1mjob[0m a number of times on different datasets.
            Figure 2.1 represents an entire flowline designed for map  digitising.
            Each  flowline  is built from a series of [1melements[0m which are connected
            together by [1mwire[0ms.  Associated with each flowline  is  a  DCL  command
            procedure.   When  a  job  is  launched  on the flowline, the flowline
            command procedure is used to create the job command  procedure,  which
            is used throughout the duration of the job's existence.

            More than one flowline may be defined on the  database  at  one  time.
            Each  flowline  is  identified  by  a unique user defined 20 character
            identifier.

  [1mElement[0m

            An element is a single operation within a  [1mflowline[0m.   In  Figure  2.1
            each  individual box represents an element.  Defined with each element
            are its conditions  for  starting  which  determine  when  it  may  be
            performed  on  a  [1mjob[0m.   The  conditions  are  specified  by a logical
            expression defined in terms of [1mwire[0ms which require to be active before
            the  element  may  be  carried  out.  In the example in figure 2.1 for
            element EDIT, the conditions are:

                         "3 AND 4" 

            This specifies that both wires 3 and 4 require to be active before the
            job  may  be performed on the element.  The logical operators "OR" and
            "NOT" and up to  8  levels  of  brackets  may  also  be  used  in  the
            definition of the conditions.

            Each element may have a number of different possible numeric outcomes.
            These  define  which wires become active when the element is completed
            on the job.  An outcome may reference more than one wire,  while  more
            than  one  outcome may reference the same wire.  In figure 2.1 element
            CHECK has 2 outcomes.  Outcome 1 activates wire  9,  while  outcome  2
            activates wire 8.  These outcomes and wires are tabulated in Table 2.1

            The actual execution of the element is  carried  out  by  the  defined
            element  command  procedure,  and  optionally the associated [1mprocedure[0m
            command file.   The  element  command  procedure  is  responsible  for
            passing valid outcomes to the LAMPSCONTROL program.

            Each element is identified by 20 character identifier which is  unique
            to the flowline of which it forms a part.

            A job is a unit of work passed through a [1mflowline[0m.  A job  is  created
            on a specified flowline, and for a specified [1mproject[0m.  In the DIGITISE
            flowline in Figure 2.1 a job would be a specific map sheet which is to
            be  digitised.   When  a  job  is  created  a DCL command procedure is
            created which contains job-specific information, and which is executed
            before the job passes through an element.  A job is started after this
            initial command procedure has been created, and is complete  when  the
            last  [1melement[0m of the flowline has been reached.  More than one job may
            be active on the flowline at a given time.

            Associated with each job is a status value, which may take  the  value
            "Created",  "Active"  or  "Held".   At  any  time a job may be held to
            prevent temporarily further activity taking place, while the "Created"
            status  indicates a job which has been created by the manager, but has
            not yet been launched on the system.  Start and finish dates and times
            are also recorded for each job.

            On job-completion the main record for the  job  is  deleted  from  the
            database.   A  history  record  is created which holds all information
            about  the  job  and  which  may  be  used  for  subsequent  reporting

            operations.

            A job is given a 20 character identifier, which is unique to  the  job
            running on the specified project.

  [1mTask[0m

            A task is the piece of work which is required to be  performed  by  an
            operator  or  sequence  of  operators  to  complete  an  [1melement[0m for a
            particular [1mjob[0m.  Tasks are created on the system as flowline  activity
            takes place.

            When a task is complete, a series of [1mwires[0m become active depending  on
            the  outcome of the task.  Each element at the end of the probed wires
            is then tested to determine if conditions  are  such  that  subsequent
            tasks  may  be  created.   In  this  way  a  job  progresses through a
            [1mflowline[0m.

            Status values are associated with each task to show:  -

            1.  Activity status - "Active", "Inactive", "Offline"  or  "Held".   A
                task may become held as a result of an error in task execution, or
                by the intervention of the manager.   Only  "Inactive"  tasks  are
                available  for  all  operators to perform.  An offline task is one
                which is not performed on the computer system.   It  may  only  be
                completed by the operator who started it.

            2.  Progress status - "Started" or "Not Started".   This  is  used  to
                record  whether  any  work has been carried out on the task.  This
                information  is  passed  to  the  element  command  procedure   by
                LAMPSCONTROL.


            As tasks are completed records  are  deleted  from  the  database  and
            history records are created for subsequent reporting operations.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mSession[0m

            A session is a period of database work on a task.   When  an  [1moperator[0m
            starts  a task a session record is created in the database.  More than
            one session may be required to complete a specific task.

            Stored in each session record is  the  operator,  [1mworkstation[0m,  timing
            information, and completion status.

            The session completion status returned to the LAMPSCONTROL program  by
            the  element  command  procedure  determines  whether  the task may be
            completed at the end of a session.  The  status  takes  the  following
            values:  -

            1.  Hold status means that an error has occurred which  requires  that
                the   task   is  given  "Held"  status,  and  requires  management
                intervention.

            2.  Continue status indicates that the task has  not  been  completed,
                and that further work is required.

            3.  Restart status means that the work  done  on  the  task  has  been
                abandoned.  Subsequent sessions will begin the task from scratch.

            4.  Complete status indicates that the task has been completed.

            5.  Sub-flowline status indicates that jobs have been  launched  on  a
                [1msub-flowline[0m on this task.


            When a task is completed all associated session records are copied  to
            the historical record which may then be used for reporting purposes.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mWire[0m

            Wires link the [1mflowline[0m [1melements[0m together, and are used in two ways:-

            1.  As tasks are completed wires become "active" depending on the [1mtask[0m
                [1moutcome[0m  passed  to  the  LAMPSCONTROL  program  from  the element
                command procedure.  These wires remain active  until  the  [1mjob[0m  is
                completed,  unless the job loops back to repeat an earlier element
                (or is moved back manually).  In this case, wires activated by the
                elements which are moved back over are de-activated again.

            2.  On a specific task completion the element at the end of each  wire
                probed is tested to determine whether the [1mconditions[0m are such that
                a task may be completed.  The conditions may be fulfilled both  by
                wires activated by the current task completion, or wires activated
                previously.  These wires need not be defined to end on the element
                in  question  -  they may indicate something that did, or did not,
                happen at an earlier stage in the flowline.


            Each wire is identified by a 20 character identifier which  is  unique
            to a specific flowline.  The identifier need not be a number, although
            the use of numbers is traditional in some flowlines.

            The "activity" of a wire is related  specifically  to  a  job.   Hence
            there is no danger of one job influencing the progress of another.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mProject[0m

            A project is a set of inter-relating jobs.  It need not be confined to
            one [1mflowline[0m.  A DCL command procedure is created for a project, which
            is executed prior to any task running on a job in the project.

            In the mapping example a project may be particular set of  map  sheets
            which require to be digitised for a particular purpose.

            Associated with each project is a status which may either be  "Active"
            or  "Held".   Thus a manager may temporarily suspend work on a project
            by setting the status to "Held".

  Project                                                          21 January 1993


            A project is identified by a single 20 character identifier  which  is
            unique to the entire database.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mProcedure[0m

            A procedure is closely associated with an [1melement[0m, but differs in that
            it  need  not  be  restricted  to a single position within a flowline.
            Thus procedures are associated with specific operations which are used
            repeatedly  either within one flowline or on different flowlines.  The
            command procedure used  to  execute  a  procedure  will  usually  only
            contain  the  necessary commands to run a particular program or simple
            sequence of programs.

            An element specification may  optionally  include  a  reference  to  a
            procedure,  but  alternatively,  all element processing may be carried
            out by the element command file alone.

            A procedure is identified by a single 20 character identifier which is
            unique to the entire database.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mOperator[0m

            An operator is a person who is authorised  to  work  on  the  flowline
            system.

            Operators may be authorised to  work  on  [1mprojects[0m,  [1mjobs[0m,  [1mflowlines[0m,
            [1melements[0m,   [1mprocedures[0m  or  to  make  use  of  facilities  within  the
            LAMPSCONTROL program.

            Each operator may have associated a number of authorisation records of
            the form:-

             operator  authorisation_type   Allowed   Identifier

            The authorisation type defines which type of database entity is  being
            authorised.  It is specified by the following two character codes:-

                 "EL"  - element

                 "DB"  - access to the flowline database by means of the
                LAMPSCONTROL program

                 "FL"  - flowline

                 "JB"  - job

                 "PC"  - procedure

                 "PJ"  - project


            The  identifier  denotes  which  specific  flowline  entity  is  being
            authorised.   For  all  but the "DB" authorisation type the identifier
            may be any entity stored in the database - for example  element  MERGE


  FLOWLINE (2.3): Database Concepts and Definition                        Page 2-6
  Operator                                                         21 January 1993


            in  the  example  DIGITISE  flowline.   The "DB" type my only take the
            following identifiers, which relate to facilities available  with  the
            LAMPSCONTROL program:-

                 "MENU"     -  for use of LAMPSCONTROL's menu facilities

                 "REQUEST"  -  to request tasks from the database

                 "MANAGE"   -  to perform management functions

                 "REPORT"   -  to perform reporting functions


            The "Allowed" (Yes/No/Everything) field indicates whether an  operator
            is  being  authorised  to  use  or  prevented  from using a particular
            database entity or LAMPSCONTROL facility.  "Everything" indicates  the
            operator  is  authorised  to work on all of the database entities with
            the specified authorisation type, and  hence  the  Identifier  is  not
            required for such records.  Note that operators who are authorised for
            "Everything" for a particular type, may also have negative records for
            the same type to prevent work on specific entities.

            The following is an example authorisation record.

             Operator = "JOHN"  
             Authorisation_type = "Element"  
             Allowed = "Yes"   (ie. positive)
             Entity Identifier = "EDIT"

            This record authorises an operator to perform work on element "EDIT".

            The following rules are used for authorisation types.   Each  rule  is
            applied in turn, stopping once a decision is reached.

            1.  If the operator has an explicit "Yes" for the entity in  question,
                then authorised.

            2.  If the operator has an explicit "No" for the entity  in  question,
                then not authorised.

            3.  If the operator has an  "Everything"  record  for  the  particular
                authorisation type, then authorised.

            4.  If the operator has one or more "Yes" records for  other  entities
                of the same authorisation type, then not authorised.

            5.  If one or more other operators has an explicit  "Yes"  record  for
                the entity in question, then not authorised.

            6.  If none of the above apply, then authorised.


            To summarise the rules less formally:

  Operator                                                         21 January 1993


            1.  The absence of any positive authorisation records for a particular
                type  implies  that an operator is authorised for [1mall[0m the entities
                of that type except for any negative  records  which  are  present
                (but see 3 below).

            2.  The presence of any positive authorisation records of a particular
                type   implies   that  an  operator  is  not  authorised  for  any
                non-present entities of that type.

            3.  The presence of a positive operator authorisation for a particular
                entity  implies  that  other operators are not authorised for that
                entity unless they have a specific positive authorisations for the
                entity  or  an  "Everything"  "Allowed"  field  for  the  relevant
                authorisation type.


            In practice these seemingly complex rules lead to a simple  method  of
            authorisation.   If  for  example,  an operator is to be authorised to
            work on only a few elements, then positive records should be used.  If
            he is to be authorised on all elements except for a few, then negative
            records should be used.

            An explicit authorisation for an operator  to  work  on  a  particular
            element implicitly de-authorises all other operators from work on that
            element.  This mechanism is useful if a certain operator (or group  of
            operators)  is the only person who may carry out a particular element.
            Specific records are therefore  not  required  to  de-authorise  other
            operators    from    carrying    out   the   element.    If   implicit
            de-authorisations  are  not  desirable  for  an  operator  working  on
            elements, then "Everything" in the "Allowed" field should be specified
            for the "EL" authorisation type.  Alternatively the  operator  may  be
            specifically authorised to also work on the element.

            The following are examples of authorisations which may be set up using
            the example flowline.

            1.  DAVID may work on anything except LASERTRAK.

            2.  JANE is the only person who may work on LASERTRAK

            3.  JIMMY may work on anything in PROJECT "BEN_NEVIS"

            4.  JOAN may work on the "BEN_NEVIS" and "SOUTH_COAST" projects  doing
                plot checking, and Map editing.

            5.  Mr_SMITH may perform management, request, and report functions.


            Also recorded with each operator is the project, job, and  element  on
            which  he  last  worked.  This information is used by the LAMPSCONTROL
            program to indicate the preferred task when  he  next  logs  into  the
            system.

            An operator is identified by a  20  character  name  which  should  be
            unique to the flowline database.

  [1mWorkstation[0m

            A workstation is a terminal device which is authorised to be  used  by
            the flowline system.

            Workstations may be authorised for use on [1mprojects,[0m  [1mjobs,[0m  [1mflowlines,[0m

            non-graphics terminals could be prevented  from  being  used  for  map
            editing.   Authorisation  records  may  be  both positive - to allow a
            workstation to be  used  for  something,  or  negative  -  to  prevent
            something  being done, or "Everything" to allow workstations to do all
            entities.  They are defined analagously to operator authorisation (see
            previous section).

            A workstation is identified by a 20 character  name  which  should  be
            unique to the flowline database.

  [1mStatic[0m [1mand[0m [1mDynamic[0m [1mDatabase[0m [1mEntities[0m

            Some of the database entities described  above  can  be  described  as
            static,  because  they  are  defined at the flowline definition phase,
            while others are dynamic  because  the  information  stored  is  in  a
            constant state of flux during flowline activity.

            Static  entities  are  [1mFlowlines,[0m  [1mElements,[0m  [1mProcedures[0m  [1mand[0m   [1mWires[0m.

            [1mactivity[0m.  [1mOperators[0m [1mand[0m [1mWorkstations[0m are a mixture of the two -  some
            operator  information  such as his name is static, while the record of
            the current job, project and element is dynamic.

            These concepts apply to the associated command files also.   Flowline,
            element  and  procedure  command  files  are  static  because they are
            written during database definition.  Project and job command files are
            dynamic  because they are created automatically when jobs and projects
            are launched on the system.

            sessions.   Whenever  a job completes, the main job database record is
            deleted and historical record  is  created.   Similarly  when  a  task
            completes, the task and associated session records are also archived.

            The historical information  is  maintained  for  use  by  the  various
            reporting facilities of LAMPSCONTROL.

            Priority  values  may  be   associated   with   [1mflowlines,[0m   [1melements,[0m
            [1mprocedures,[0m  [1mprojects[0m [1mand[0m [1mjobs[0m.  The LAMPSCONTROL program makes use of
            these priorities to determine the order in which  projects,  jobs  and
            tasks  are  offered  to the operator.  Larger priority values indicate
            greater priority.

            Priorities are specified as integer values between  1  and  16.   Each
            task  has  an  implicit priority related to its creation time.  Thus a
            task gains priority, the longer it remains on the system.

            Priorities themselves have the following order of precedence:

             Project 
             Flowline 
             Job 
             Element 
             Task

            Thus for example, if for example all elements have the same  priority,
            then tasks are listed only in order of task priority.

            The record of the current project, job and element  for  a  particular
            operator takes precedence over all the above priorities.

            It should be noted that the priorities normally only affect the  order
            in  which  information  is  presented  to  the operator.  Provided the
            default /MENU qualifier is specified with  the  LAMPSCONTROL  program,
            then  at  any  time  he may carry out any of the tasks for which he is
            authorised, on his current workstation.

  [1mSub-flowlines[0m

            A sub-flowline is effectively a sub-routine which may be called from a
            single  element  of  the  main  flowline.   The sub-flowline itself is
            defined in the same way as a normal flowline.  The  specified  element
            to run the sub-flowline may start a variable number of sub-jobs on the
            sub-flowline.  Only when all these jobs are complete is  the  task  on
            the calling element complete.

            An example mapping application for sub-flowlines would  be  if  a  map
            sheet  was  required to be split into smaller sections for digitising,
            and post processing.  Figure 2.2 shows this sub-flowline  which  could
            be  inserted  in  element  DIG_CONT  in  Figure  2.1.  This would also
            require a further element in the DIGITISE flowline to  merge  all  the
            sections together.  Only when all the sections of the map are complete
            is the main job free to proceed.

            The relevant element command procedure  is  responsible  for  starting
            jobs on a sub-flowline.  Chapter 4 contains further information on all
            flowline command files.

            One of  the  important  features  of  the  FLOWLINE  package  is  that
            information  which  is  relevant  to  a  particular  job  may  be made
            available to tasks by means DCL symbols assigned  values  in  the  job
            command procedure for that job.  (see Chapter 4 for a full description
            of command file creation).  This information is normally entered  when
            the flowline manager launches a job on the system.

            In some cases, however, it may be necessary for  particular  tasks  to
            pass  information  either  to  immediately succeeding tasks, or to any
            subsequent tasks in the  job  for  which  it  may  be  required.   The
            flowline  database holds such information as [1mParameters[0m of which there
            are three types:- .

            1.  A [1mglobal[0m [1mparameter[0m which has been set up by a  task  is  available
                for use in any subsequent tasks in the job.

            2.  A [1mlocal[0m [1mparameter[0m is passed to all immediately succeeding tasks in
                the job.  (ie.  tasks on those elements joined by a single wire to
                the element which creates the parameter).   Local  parameters  may
                also  be used to pass information from session to session within a
                task.

            3.  An [1mexternal[0m [1mparameter[0m is used to pass information from  a  sub-job
                to  the  enclosing  outer-job.   When  a  sub-job  completes,  any
                external parameters are translated into local  parameters  in  the
                outer task.

            Parameters should be valid DCL statements and will normally be  symbol
            assignments.    LAMPSCONTROL  ensures  that  the  DCL  statements  are
            executed prior to the carrying out of the relevant tasks in the job.

            Chapter 5 describes the methods by which parameters may be set  up  in
            element command files.

            The definition of a flowline database may be  carried  out  using  the
            appropriate  options  on  the  top-level LAMPSCONTROL management menu.
            Screen forms are provided for the  interactive  input  of  the  static
            flowline,  element,  wire  and  procedure  information all of which is
            required for complete flowline definition.

            If a flow diagram has not been  created  during  the  flowline  design
            phase,  then  it  is  essential  that  one  should  be prepared before
            definition in the database, for all  but  the  simplest  applications.
            The  flow  diagram, not only facilitates the definition procedure, but
            also, with careful annotation, serves as a record of the  flowline  as
            it  is  stored  in  the  database.   It  will also prove valuable as a
            "debugging" tool.

  Flowline Definition                                              21 January 1993


            A flow diagram for the  database  definition  has  slightly  different
            conventions from usual.  The flow diagram structure should be composed
            entirely of elements and linking wires.  Decision boxes are  generally
            incorporated  within  elements, which may be defined to have different
            outcomes which in turn affect the outgoing wires.

            Each flowline should have a single start and  single  ending  element,
            which   is   used  by  LAMPSCONTROL  for  job  launch  and  completion
            respectively.  In the example DIGITISE flowline in  figure  2.1  these
            are START_DIG and END_DIG.  Clearly the start element does not require
            initial conditions, and will only have one outcome which should have a
            value of 1.  Similarly, the final element has no outcome.

            Once the flow diagram has been constructed,  each  of  the  wires  and
            elements  should  be  labelled  with unique identifiers.  Each wire is
            also directional, therefore an element has  both  incoming  wires  and
            outgoing  wires.   For  each  element  it is necessary to tabulate the
            initial conditions, and the outcomes, along with the wires  which  are
            affected.   This  is  done for the example flowlines in Tables 2.1 and
            2.2.

            Once  a  flowline  has  been  entered  into  the  system  the  various
            parameters  may  be  examined  either  on a terminal screen or printed
            using the reporting  facilities  of  the  LAMPSCONTROL  program.   The
            various  static  command  files  which  are  required  should  then be
            designed.  Chapter 4 contains information on command file creation.

            The flowline system, once operating, requires day to day management to
            resolve problems which may occur and monitor performance.

            This chapter describes generally  flowline  operation,  and  describes
            trouble  shooting  methods.   Precise instructions of how to carry out
            the procedures described are to be found in chapter 5, which  provides
            detailed documentation on the LAMPSCONTROL program.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mGeneral[0m [1mSystem[0m [1mOperation[0m

            Flowline operations are  carried  out  by  DCL  command  files,  while
            interaction  with  the  database  is  achieved  using the LAMPSCONTROL
            program.  Command files may be generated by the LAMPSCONTROl  program,
            and may call LAMPSCONTROL to notify the database of flowline events.

            In the normal  mode  of  operation  the  use  of  LAMPSCONTROL/REQUEST
            enables  an  operator  to select a task to execute, in a specified job
            and project.  The program  generates  a  command  file  from  database
            information,  which contains the necessary DCL commands to perform the
            task.  This "jacket command procedure" contains references to project,
            job,  element  and  procedure command files.  Information is passed to
            these command files by means of DCL symbols set up at the start of the
            jacket  command  procedure.   Near  the  end  of the file is a call to
            LAMPSCONTROL/NOTIFY to indicate to the database  that  a  session  has
            been  completed.   Information  regarding  session  status  and timing
            statistics   is   transferred   using   subsidiary    qualifiers    to
            LAMPSCONTROL/NOTIFY.    Further   information   on  command  files  is
            contained in chapter 4.

            The operator may choose a project, job and  task  to  perform  from  a
            hierarchy    of   menus.    By   default,   on   invocation   of   the
            LAMPSCONTROL/REQUEST program, the operator is first presented  with  a
            choice  of  tasks  in the job and project on which he last worked.  If
            there are no tasks available the job selection menu is displayed,  and
            if  there  are  no jobs then the project selection menu is shown.  The
            menus offer the options to select a project, job or task and  also  to
            move  up  to  a  higher  level  menu  or  log  out  of the system.  If
            LAMPSCONTROL/REQUEST/NOMENU is specified  then  task  selection  takes
            place automatically.

            Management options to create both jobs and projects, which are present
            on  the LAMPSCONTROL management menu, operate in a similar way to task
            selection.  Once the manager has entered the relevant information  for
            a  job  to  be  created,  LAMPSCONTROL generates a jacket command file
            which is used to create the job specific command file.   This  command
            file  is  generated using the flowline command file which interrogates
            the manager for various job-specific data.  The  jacket  command  file
            for  this  operation  also  contains  a call to LAMPSCONTROL/NOTIFY to
            indicate that the job may be started on the system.

            Monitoring of the FLOWLINE system  is  achieved  through  use  of  the
            reporting  options of the LAMPSCONTROL program.  The status of all the
            current projects, jobs, tasks, and sessions may be examined using  the
            appropriate  reporting  option.   The  manager may therefore view what
            work  is  currently  being  carried  out,  by  whom,  and   on   which
            workstation.   The  "Inactive"  tasks  which are waiting to be done as
            soon as authorised operators selects them are also shown.  Tasks which
            are  "Held"  are those which have been held by the manager explicitly,
            or those tasks which have been attempted by  an  operator,  but  which
            have failed in some way, and require manager investigation.

            Information is also available on a  per-operator  and  per-workstation
            basis.   Thus  the manager can find what any operator is doing, or for
            what a particular workstation is currently being used.

            Using these functions a manager may very quickly gain an  appreciation
            of  the  current  state  of the system, and may use the information to
            exploit manpower and workstation resources to the full.

            LAMPSCONTROL also allows a log file to  be  specified  with  the  /LOG
            qualifier.   All  messages  output by LAMPSCONTROL are also written to
            this file, and hence it provides a record  of  system  activity.   Log
            files  may  be common to a single operator or may be shared by a group
            of operators.  It is recommended that log files are regularly  deleted
            to save on disk space and to improve program efficiency.

            The flowline manager may control flow  of  work  carried  out  on  the
            system by the following methods:

            1.  [3mHolding[0m [3mprojects,[0m [3mjobs[0m [3mor[0m [3mtasks[0m  to  prevent  further  work  being
                carried   out   on  them.   They  may  subsequently  be  released.
                Selection of the Status modification option  on  the  menu  allows
                both  holding  and  release to be performed.  If a project is held
                then no jobs or tasks in that project will be performed.  If a job
                is  held  then  no  tasks in the job are carried out.  If a job or
                project which  contains  active  tasks  is  held,  then  they  may
                complete,  but no further tasks are offered for operators to carry
                out.  An active task may not, however be held.

                It is useful to be able to hold projects  or  jobs  if  a  problem
                occurs  in  the flowline which requires time to diagnose the fault
                before further work is carried out.

                Chapter 2 describes how the various priorities are used.  The list

                are always presented in decreasing order of priority (but see  (3)

                below).  The flowline manager should therefore encourage operators
                to choose the first item in the list to ensure the priority system
                has  maximum effect.  Job and Project menus operate similarly.  If
                the /NOMENU qualifier is specified with LAMPSCONTROL/REQUEST  then
                automatic selection of the highest priority task takes place.

            Flowline tasks may fail for a number  of  reasons.   The  database  is
            notified  of  a task failure by the call to LAMPSCONTROL/NOTIFY in the
            jacket command file.  The error return status is set up in the element
            command  procedure.   Normally  element command procedures should only
            return the error status, if the error is  serious  enough  to  require
            management  investigation  before  the task may proceed.  On receiving
            this status LAMPSCONTROL sets the task status  value  to  "Held".   In
            addition  more  information  regarding  the nature of the error may be
            ascertained by looking in the LAMPSCONTROL log file.  Once the problem
            has  been  solved,  the  task  may  be  released  by use of the Status
            Modification option in the main  LAMPSCONTROL  management  menu.   The
            task  may either be "restarted" or "continued" depending on the nature
            of the error.

            In the event of a computer crash all sessions  on  the  system  remain
            active in the FLOWLINE database.  On system startup these sessions are
            still present even although clearly no operators are  working  on  the
            flowline.   The  manager  must  therefore notify the database of their
            completion.  This may be done using the  notify  option  on  the  main
            LAMPSCONTROL  management  menu.  The associated tasks may be restarted
            or continued depending on whether pre-crash work may  be  salvaged  or
            whether the task requires to be done again from scratch.

            The actual database integrity is always ensured  for  a  system  crash
            because  database  updates  are  carried  out in a single transaction,
            which is rolled back by Rdb recovery procedures.

            A manager may decide that some work done on a job may be invalid.   If
            for example a task was carried out on an element near the beginning of
            the flowline, and it  was  later  discovered  that  the  output  files
            produced  were  corrupt,  then subsequent tasks using these files will
            also have produced spurious results.  To deal with the situation a job
            may  be  reset  in  the  flowline  using the appropriate option of the
            Job-status modification menu.  The manager  may  select  one  or  more
            elements  of the flowline back to which the job is to be repositioned.
            All tasks and active wires  which  emanate  from  these  elements  are
            deleted.

            A job which is reset is automatically "Held" by the database.  It must
            subsequently  be  released  once  it  has  been  ensured  that correct
            resetting has taken place.

            Note that is not possible to jump down a flowline and reset a  job  on
            an  element  which  has  not  previously  had a task run on it.  It is
            however possible, though not advisable, to skip a task on a job  using
            the  skip  task  option  of  the  task-status modification menu.  This
            facility should only be used with care, because any output files  that
            will normally be generated by the task will not be produced.

            The status modification option of the main management menu allows both
            tasks and jobs to be deleted from the system.

            Project deletion results in the deletion of all  history  records  for
            jobs,  tasks,  and  sessions  within  it.   These records are used for
            statistical reporting purposes, and so it  is  recommended  that  this
            option  is  not  used unless it is necessary to reduce the size of the
            database.  This is the only method by which  the  database  historical
            records  may  be  erased.  Project deletion is invalid if any jobs are
            currently present within it.

            Job deletion results in the deletion of all tasks that currently exist
            within  it.   The  option is invalid if there are currently any active

            One of the strengths of the FLOWLINE system  is  in  the  handling  of
            tasks  that  are  normally  carried out as computer batch jobs.  It is
            possible to set up a batch queue as  a  pseudo-flowline  operator.   A
            captive  command file which runs the LAMPSCONTROL system may be set up
            to run as a batch job.   The  pseudo-operator  may  be  authorised  to
            perform  tasks  which  may  be  run  in batch.  As soon as such a task
            becomes available on the system the batch job will automatically start
            doing  it.  Several such batch queues may be set up if there is a high
            proportion of batch-job work in the system.

            LAMPSCONTROL/REQUEST/NOMENU should be used in the  batch  job  command
            file  to  ensure  automatic  task  selection.  The example controlling
            command  file   LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.EXAMPLES]CONTROL_EXAMPLE.COM
            offers a control mode for operating in batch.

  [1mIntroduction[0m

            The flowline control system relies on DCL Command procedures  (Command
            Files)  to carry out flowline operations.  Their development is by far
            the most onerous job in the creation of a working flowline.   Bugs  in
            command  files  are  notoriously  difficult  to  trace,  and  so it is
            essential that a systematic approach is adopted  in  order  to  reduce
            programming errors to a minimum.

            One of the main  requirements  of  the  design  of  the  command  file
            structure  is  that  operator  input of information such as filenames,
            program command line information  should  be  reduced  to  a  minimum,
            thereby  reducing  the  possibility  of  production  errors  caused by
            operator  mistakes.   This  may  be  achieved  by   ascertaining   the
            information  which  is constant to a project or job.  For example in a
            map digitising flowline, a job may consist  of  digitising  map  sheet
            NORTHWEST1  with  geographical  boundaries  defined by the coordinates
            SW(100,100) NE(500,500).  This information is constant for the  entire
            job  and  may be entered by the manager when the job is created on the
            system.   File  names  for  this  job  could  contain  references   to
            NORTHWEST1  while  programs which require the geographical information
            may use the pre-determined values.   Element  command  procedures  may
            make  use  of  this job-specific information rather than interrogating
            the operator.

            The following are the main classes of command file which exist in  the
            flowline system.

            1.  Operator Login and Control Command Files

            2.  Flowline System Command File

            3.  Flowline Command files

            4.  Element Command Files

            5.  Procedure Command Files

            6.  Project Command Files

            7.  Job command files

            8.  Jacket Command Files


            Some of these command files are created by the  system  manager,  some
            are  generated by the LAMPSCONTROL program, while some are produced by
            others.  Each of these categories is now considered in detail.

            It is assumed that the reader is familiar with  DCL  (Digital  Command
            Language)  procedures.  The DEC manual "Guide to Using DCL and Command
            Procedures on VAX/VMS" provides further information.

            Examples of the various types of command procedure  are  held  in  the
            directory LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[FLOWLINE.EXAMPLES].

            The login command file sets up various DCL symbols and  logical  names
            which  may  be  used  at a later stage.  This includes the workstation
            type and the operators identity as well as common logical names.   The
            command  file  should  then  call  LAMPSCONTROL  with  the appropriate
            qualifiers, thus immediately presenting the operator with  a  menu  of
            options   to   carry  out  on  the  system.   Following  the  call  to
            LAMPSCONTROL the jacket  command  command  procedure  created  by  the
            program  should  be  invoked  to  carry out the option selected by the
            operator.  A subsequent  loop  back  to  the  LAMPSCONTROL  invocation
            statement  in  the  command file ensures that the operator never exits
            the captive login command file until the exit option  is  selected  in
            the program.

            The actual call to LAMPSCONTROL will vary depending  on  the  type  of
            operator   and  workstation.   (see  chapter  5).   The  example  file
            CONTROL_EXAMPLE.COM is a general purpose FLOWLINE controlling  command
            file which takes parameters according to the type of operator and mode
            of operation.  This file could be called  from  within  an  operator's
            login command file.  Such generally used login command files should be
            stored in the directory LSL$FLN_LOGIN.

            The flowline system command file is executed by the system manager  at
            the  start  of  any  project.  It asks for information relevant to the
            project as a whole such as file extensions to be  used  for  both  the
            command  procedures  written  and for the job in its various stages in
            the flowline.

            The information gathered by the system  command  file  is  written  to
            another  command  file  (the  project  command file) which is executed
            before any element so that any part of the flowline can have access to
            this  information.   The  name  of  the  project  command  file  to be
            constructed can be built up from the project name which is  passed  to
            the system command procedure (see chapter 5 on LAMPSCONTROL variables)
            although it may be wise to give the system manager an  opportunity  to
            change  it.   It  should  be noted that this filename should be unique
            throughout the  system.   As  with  all  command  procedures  relevant
            information  such as the name of the command procedure written and the
            program status on completion (e.g.'error' or 'complete')  be  returned
            to LAMPSCONTROL via the system variables.

            Normally one system command file will be required to  be  written  for
            the  FLOWLINE  system  to operate, and will be stored in the directory
            LSL$FLN_PROJECT.  The file may be edited using the appropriate  option
            on the LAMPSCONTROL Flowline System Definition Menu.

            This command file is run by the system manager at the start of a  job.
            It  performs  a  similar  task  to  the system command file in that it
            writes information to a command file for execution before  an  element
            is  started.   This  command  file  gathers  information relevant to a
            particular job such as a map name, control  points  and  possibly  the
            names of other files to be called later in the flowline.

            The name of the job  is  passed  to  this  flowline  command  file  by
            LAMPSCONTROL  so  a  unique  command file name can be constructed from
            this.  The name of the job command procedure  written,  together  with
            the  status  of  the  job creation process (e.g.'error' or 'complete')
            should be  passed  back  to  LAMPSCONTROL  via  the  system  variables
            described in chapter 5.

            Normally  flowline  command  files  are  stored   in   the   directory
            LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_JOB,  which is a search list of a directory on
            LSL$SITE_ROOT for transient and  locally  edited  files,  and  another
            directory  for  more  permanent files.  A flowline command file may be
            edited using the  appropriate  option  on  the  LAMPSCONTROL  Flowline
            System  Definition Menu.  Care should be taken that the edited version
            goes into the intended directory.

            The element command files, when called, perform a task on a job.   The
            element  may  contain  interactive  or non-interactive functions which
            form an identifiable unit.  The units should be kept relatively  small
            to  fully  utilise the potential of the system for data integrity.  It
            is suggested that no more than one call to an interactive  program  is
            made  within  a  procedure  so  that the data can be saved immediately
            before any more processing is carried out.  It is however sensible  to
            group calls to automatic functions together in one element to make the
            execution more efficient.   In  general  the  major  functions  of  an
            element  command  file are to set up various symbols and then call the
            procedure command file.

            It is advised that symbols for all input and output files which are to
            be  used in the element or the procedure command file are set up here.
            The symbols set up by the project and job command files may be used to
            build  the  filename.  For example if the symbol JOB_NAME is set up in
            the job command file and PROJECT_PREFIX, EDIT_PREFIX  and  EDIT_SUFFIX
            are set up in the project command file to identify a project and task,
            then a symbol can be set up in the element file in the following way.

                 [1m$[0m [1mINPUT_FILE[0m [1m=[0m [1mEDIT_PREFIX[0m [1m+[0m [1mJOB_PREFIX[0m [1m+[0m [1mJOB_NAME[0m [1m+[0m [1mEDIT_SUFFIX[0m

            The symbol INPUT_FILE  can  then  be  used  in  the  element,  or  the
            procedure command file it calls, as a unique identifier for a job at a
            particular stage in the flowline.  This is important as it means  that
            a  uniquely  named copy of the file remains in situ after each element
            has executed.  The element  can  therefore  be  rerun  with  the  same
            initial  data  in  the event of a problem.  The database also requires
            other symbols indicating the status of the element to be  set  up  and
            these are detailed in chapter 5.

            In general the element will pass  control  to  the  procedure  command
            procedure   for  the  actual  processing  but  if  only  trivial  user
            interaction is  required  then  the  element  could  do  this  itself.
            Although  an element must be unique and each element may have only one
            procedure a procedure may be shared by several elements.  The database
            sets  up  a  symbol 'FLN_PROCEDURE_COMPROC' containing the name of the
            procedure to be called.  This  allows  for  more  flexibility  in  the
            system and is explained more fully in chapter 5 (Lampscontrol).

            Normally  element  command  files  are   stored   in   the   directory
            LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_ELEMENT,  but  locally edited copies may be in
            the directory LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_SITE.  For this reason,  element
            command  files  should  usually  be  referred  to  by  the search list
            LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_COM,  which  includes  both   of   the   above
            directories.   An  element  command  file  may  be  edited  using  the
            appropriate option on  the  LAMPSCONTROL  Flowline  System  Definition
            Menu.   Care  should  be  taken  that the edited version goes into the
            intended directory.

            The procedure command procedures are called by the element to  do  the
            actual work in calling programs and interfacing with the user.  All of
            the files that it uses have already been set  up  as  symbols  by  the
            element.   As  has  been  mentioned  above  it  is  important that the
            procedure creates a new uniquely named file if any changes are  to  be
            made  to  the input file.  This ensures that in the event of a problem
            in the job, it may be restarted at any point in the flowline with  the
            original data.

            In some cases a program started up by the  command  file  expects  all
            input  to  come from the file, this is not always what is required and
            the  command  'DEFINE/USER  SYS$INPUT  SYS$COMMAND'  will  inform  the
            program to expect any input to come from user.

            The database requires various symbols to be set up to give the  status
            of  the  element.  As much of the processing within an element is done
            by this procedure, responsibility for maintaining these  variables  is
            also  assumed.   The  symbols  are  explained  fully  in chapter 5 and
            include, for example, flags to show whether the element is complete or
            if  the  operator just wanted to end a session.  The operator may have
            to be asked questions at the end of a session  to  determine  what  is
            happening.

            Normally  procedure  command  files  are  stored  in   the   directory
            LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_PROCEDURE, but locally edited copies may be in
            the  directory   LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_SITE.    For   this   reason,
            procedure  command  files  should usually be referred to by the search
            list LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_COM, which includes  both  of  the  above
            directories.   A  procedure  command  file  may  be  edited  using the
            appropriate option on  the  LAMPSCONTROL  Flowline  System  Definition
            Menu.   Care  should  be  taken  that the edited version goes into the
            intended directory.

            These are written by the system command files (see above) and  contain
            information  such  as  file  extensions  and work directories that are
            unique to a particular project.  The project command file is  executed
            before  any  element is called and the information contained within it
            can therefore be referenced by any element executed.

            Normally  project  command  files  are   stored   in   the   directory
            LSL$FLN_PROJECT.   They  may  be edited using the LAMPSCONTROL Project

            The job command files are written by the flowline command  files  (see
            above).   They  are  executed, together with the project command file,
            whenever an element is run.  This file sets up information related  to
            a  particular  job for example the map scale or corner points could be
            set up here and then referenced by any element in the flowline or  any
            sub-flowlines  beneath  it.   Normally job command files are stored in
            the directory LSL$FLN_"flowline_name"_JOB.  They may be  edited  using
            the LAMPSCONTROL Job Status Modification Menu.

            The jacket command procedure is written by LAMPSCONTROL.  It  sets  up
            the  system  variables  used  in  the other command procedures such as
            FLN_PROCEDURE_COMPROC which tells an element which  procedure  command
            procedure  it  should  call.   The  jacket command file also calls the
            project and job command files to set up related symbols before calling
            the  element.   Normally  jacket  command  files  are  placed  in  the
            directory LSL$FLN_JACKET.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mSub-flowlines[0m

            In addition to the main flowline sub-flowlines may exist.  These  have
            the  same  structure as the main flowline and should be able to be run
            as standalone flowlines.  This is particularly important  for  testing
            and  debugging  purposes.   A  sub-flowline is used when a job becomes
            subdivided and several tasks are required to be done.  For  example  a
            flowline may be the preparation of a digital map, if the map has to be
            split into segments for digitising and processing then a  sub-flowline
            would  be  constructed for this and the segments would be submitted as
            separate jobs.  When all of these are complete then the main  flowline
            job may proceed.

            The command file for an element which calls a sub-flowline  is  fairly
            complex.   For  each sub-job to be launched, LAMPSCONTROL/CREATE_JOB =
            "sub-job-name"  should  be  invoked.   Thus  a  looping  structure  is
            required.


  FLOWLINE (2.3): Flowline Command Files                                  Page 4-6
  Sub-flowlines                                                    21 January 1993


            The flowline command file for the sub-flowline is invoked  within  the
            jacket  command  procedure  generated by the LAMPSCONTROL job creation
            operation.  The jacket command file should also be called  within  the
            element  command  procedure  loop.  The sub-flowline command file will
            therefore be invoked for each of  the  sub-jobs.   Clearly  this  will
            involve   duplication   of   operator   input,  because  much  sub-job
            information will be constant for all the sub-jobs.  For this reason it
            is  better to set up such information in the calling job.  This may be
            done by setting up  symbols  outside  the  job-creation  loop  in  the
            calling  element  command  procedure or in the job command file of the
            calling job.  In order to allow the sub-flowline to be run standalone,
            if  necessary,  the  flowline command procedure should test that these
            symbols are null before prompting the user for their values.

            A simpler, though not as flexible solution is to test  the  values  of
            system variables such as "FLN_OUTER_JOB_NAME" from within the flowline
            command file.  If this symbol is null then the flowline is  being  run
            standalone  and  should  gather  all  the relevant information itself.
            Otherwise it should assume that the calling element  has  set  up  the
            relevant symbols.

            The elements and procedure command procedures  within  a  sub-flowline
            are exactly the same as those in a flowline.

  [1mFunction[0m

            The LAMPSCONTROL utility allows a flowline system manager to define  a
            flowline  system  containing one or more flowlines, to create projects
            to use the flowline system, and to launch jobs on selected  flowlines.
            The manager is able to edit any command procedures associated with the
            operation of the system from within LAMPSCONTROL.

            LAMPSCONTROL examines and updates  a  relational  database  containing
            information  about  the definitions of various flowlines, the progress
            of projects and jobs on  those  flowlines,  and  the  details  of  the
            various operators and workstations using the flowline control system.

            The  flowline  system  manager  may  use  LAMPSCONTROL  to   authorise
            operators  and  workstations  to  access  specified  components of the
            system.

            In a different mode of operation, LAMPSCONTROL allows the selection of
            tasks to perform by ordinary operators according to a priority scheme.
            It ensures that tasks are correctly sequenced with  reference  to  the
            definitions of flowlines, elements and wires.

            Reports may be obtained using LAMPSCONTROL on the  system  definition,
            the  status  of  projects  and  jobs in the system, and the historical
            statistics of the system and those who are using it.

            If required, LAMPSCONTROL  will  generate  a  command  procedure  file
            (known  as the 'jacket command procedure') to execute existing command
            procedures  which  will  perform  any   operations,   such   as   file
            manipulations  and  calls  to  other  utilities,  necessary  to create
            projects, to launch jobs and to carry out tasks  defined  by  flowline
            elements.

  COMMAND QUALIFIERS                                               21 January 1993


  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mCommand[0m [1mQualifiers[0m



  /COMMAND_FILE=file-spec (default, value=LSL$FLN_JACKET:FLN_JACKET.COM)
  /NOCOMMAND_FILE

          - If present, /COMMAND_FILE specifies that a jacket  command  procedure,
            which will carry out the operations requested from LAMPSCONTROL by the
            user, is to be created .  The default file specification,  from  which
            any  missing part the file specification on the command line is taken,
            is 'LSL$FLN_JACKET:FLN_JACKET.COM'.


  /CPU=cpu-time
  /NOCPU (default)

          - The  /CPU  qualifier  should  be  used  with   /NOTIFY,   /SESSION_ID,
            /SESSION_RESULT and /OUTCOME to inform LAMPSCONTROL of the termination
            of a session.  /CPU is used  to  specify  the  CPU  time,  in  integer
            hundredths of seconds, used in performing the session.


  /CREATE_JOB=job-name
  /NOCREATE_JOB (default)

          - The  /CREATE_JOB  qualifier  is  used  with  /MANAGE,  /OUTER_TASK_ID,
            /FLOWLINE_ID,  and  /PROJECT_ID  to  indicate  that  a  job  with  the
            specified name (a character  string)  be  launched  on  the  indicated
            flowline,  as  part  of  the  specified  project.  This qualifier will
            generally be used with calls  of  LAMPSCONTROL  from  element  command
            procedures    for    elements   which   enclose   subflowlines.    The
            /OUTER_TASK_ID is used to  specify  the  task  executing  the  element
            command  procedure.   The  job  creation  in this case is done without
            menus, and the /NOMENU qualifier is advisable with /CREATE_JOB.


  /CREATION_RESULT=creation-result
  /NOCREATION_RESULT (default)

          - The /CREATION_RESULT qualifier is used with  /NOTIFY  and  /JOB_ID  or
            /PROJECT_ID  to  inform  LAMPSCONTROL  of the outcome of an attempt to
            initiate a job  or  project.   The  job  or  project  will  have  been
            previously   created  using  an  appropriate  LAMPSCONTROL  management
            operation.  The 'creation-result' is one of the following keywords:

                 [1mSUCCESS[0m   The   job   or   project   initiation   has    finished
                           successfully.
                 [1mFAILURE[0m   The job or project initiation has failed.

  Command Qualifiers                                               21 January 1993


  /FAST_AUTHORISE (default)
  /NOFAST_AUTHORISE

          - When  the  qualifier  /FAST_AUTHORISE  is  used   the   operator   and
            workstation  authorisation  checks  are  skipped  on  the  second  and
            subsequent invocations of LAMPSCONTROL within a single session.   This
            can   give   substantial   speed  improvements  for  certain  flowline
            sequences.


  /FLOWLINE_ID=flowline-id
  /NOFLOWLINE_ID (default)

          - The qualifier /FLOWLINE_ID is used with  /CREATE_JOB  to  specify  the
            flowline  on  which  a  job is to be launched.  The 'flowline-id' is a
            character string.


  /JOB_ID=job-id
  /NOJOB_ID (default)

          - The /JOB_ID qualifier is used with /NOTIFY  to  indicate  that  a  job
            launching operation, previously requested from the management menus or
            with the  /MANAGE  and  /CREATE_JOB  qualifiers,  has  been  completed
            successfully.   The 'job-id' is an integer, its value will be given by
            the DCL symbol 'FLN_JOB_ID' defined in the  jacket  command  procedure
            setup by LAMPSCONTROL when the job launching operation was requested.


  /LOG=file-spec (default, value = LSL$FLN_LOG:FLN.LOG)
  /NOLOG

          - If  the  /LOG  qualifier  is  present  on  the  command   line,   then
            LAMPSCONTROL  will  write  details of any error encountered during its
            operations to the specified text file.  If the  file  already  exists,
            the  details  will  be appended to it.  If the file does not exist, it
            will be created.  This allows the flowline system manager to study  an
            operator's log file to find details of any errors which have occurred.
            A log file could be unique to an operator, or shared by  a  number  of
            operators.
            In the case of a shared file, details of all the errors encountered by
            the  operators  will  be  appended  to  the  same file.  If a group of
            operators is to have a shared log file, then the same file  should  be
            specified  with  this  qualifier in the command line which they use to
            call LAMPSCONTROL.  If a number of operators attempt to write  to  the
            log  file  at  the  same time, then one or more of the messages may be
            lost.  This avoids an operator being held up for  a  long  time  while
            LAMPSCONTROL  waits  for  the  log  file to become available for it to
            write to.
            A log file should not be allowed to become too large (more than a  few
            hundred   blocks).    The  larger  a  log  file  becomes,  the  longer
            LAMPSCONTROL requires to write a message to it.

  Command Qualifiers                                               21 January 1993


  /LOGOFF (default)
  /NOLOGOFF

          - The /LOGOFF qualifier is used to specify that, when the  user  selects
            the  'Exit  from  LAMPSCONTROL'  option  on LAMPSCONTROL'S current top
            level menu, the command procedure created by LAMPSCONTROL will  logoff
            the user from his current terminal session.

            If /NOLOGOFF is specified, a null command  procedure,  which  will  do
            nothing, is created.

            In either case, LAMPSCONTROL will finish executing after creating  the
            command  procedure.   If /NOCOMMAND_FILE was specified, in the command
            line, no command procedure will  be  created,  regardless  of  whether
            /LOGOFF or /NOLOGOFF was used.


  /MANAGE
  /NOMANAGE (default)

          - The /MANAGE qualifier is used to specify that a  management  operation
            is  required  of  LAMPSCONTROL.   If  this  qualifier  is used without
            /CREATE_JOB, LAMPSCONTROL will enter the 'Main Management  Menu'  when
            it  begins to operate, providing the user is authorised to access this
            menu.  If the /CREATE_JOB qualifier is used  with  /MANAGE,  then  job
            launching will be initiated without passing through any menus.


  /MENU (default)
  /NOMENU

          - If the /MENU qualifier is specified, then LAMPSCONTROL  will  function
            in its interactive mode.  If /NOMENU is used on the command line, then
            LAMPSCONTROL will function  non-interactively.   These  two  modes  of
            operation  may  or  may  not  be  sensible,  depending  on  the  other
            qualifiers used on the command line.


  /NEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE=file-spec
  /NONEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE (default)

          - The /NEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE qualifier specifies a project or  job  wide
            command  procedure  which has just been created as part of the project
            or job initiation procedure.  /NEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE should be used in
            combination with /NOTIFY and either /PROJECT_ID or /JOB_ID to indicate
            the successful creation of a project or job command procedure file  by
            the system or flowline command procedures respectively.

  Command Qualifiers                                               21 January 1993


  /NOTIFY
  /NONOTIFY (default)

          - The /NOTIFY qualifier  specifies  that  a  notification  operation  is
            required  of  LAMPSCONTROL.   /NOTIFY should be used with /SESSION_ID,
            /PROJECT_ID or /PROJECT_ID to specify the termination  of  a  session,
            the start of a project or the start of a job, respectively.


  /OUTCOME=integer
  /NOOUTCOME (default)

          - The /OUTCOME  qualifier  is  used  in  conjunction  with  /NOTIFY  and
            /SESSION_ID  to  specify  the  termination  of a session.  When a task
            completes successfully, the  outcome  is  looked  up  in  the  element
            definition,  and  the  appropriate  wires  are  activated.  Any values
            specified should correspond to one in the definition for  the  element
            related to the task just completed.


  /OUTER_TASK_ID=task-id
  /NOOUTER_TASK_ID (default)

          - The /OUTER_TASK_ID qualifier is used with /MANAGE and  /CREATE_JOB  to
            launch  a  job  non-interactively.   The 'task-id' is an integer which
            specifies the enclosing task if  the  job  is  to  be  launched  on  a
            subflowline.   If  the job is being launched on a main flowline, which
            is not enclosed by an  element  in  another  flowline,  the  'task-id'
            should be 0.


  /PARAMETERS
  /NOPARAMETERS (default)

          - If the /PARAMETERS qualifier is used with the /NOTIFY and  /SESSION_ID
            qualifiers  when  performing  session  termination notification, then,
            when LAMPSCONTROL begins execution, a  command  driven  mode  will  be
            entered which allows the user to enter (directly, or through a command
            file) local, global  and  external  parameters  (see  Chapter  2)  for
            passing to other sessions or tasks.
            The commands available in this command driven mode are described below
            in the section 'Defining Local, Global and External Parameters'.
            The parameters are generally  defined  within  element  and  procedure
            command  procedures,  called  from  task jacket command procedures, by
            setting up appropriate DCL symbols  to  be  interpreted  by  the  task
            jacket  command  procedure.   These DCL symbols are described below in
            the section 'Jacket Command Procedures and DCL Symbols'.

  Command Qualifiers                                               21 January 1993


  /PRIORITY=integer
  /NOPRIORITY (default)

          - The /PRIORITY qualifier is used in conjunction  with  the  /CREATE_JOB
            qualifier  when non-interactive job launching is being performed.  The
            /PRIORITY qualifier is used to specify the numeric priority (between 1
            and 16) of the job to be launched.


  /PROBLEM=problem-descriptor
  /NOPROBLEM (default)

          - The /PROBLEM qualifier is used with /NOTIFY and /SESSION_ID to pass  a
            character  'problem-descriptor'  to  LAMPSCONTROL  in  cases  where  a
            session has terminated in with an 'ERROR' or  'RESTART'  result.   The
            'problem-descriptor'  gives brief details of the cause of the problem,
            for example the name of the utility during the execution of  which  an
            error occurred.


  /PROJECT_ID=project-id
  /NOPROJECT_ID (default)

          - The /PROJECT_ID qualifier, when used  with  /MANAGE  and  /CREATE_JOB,
            specifies  the  'project-id', the character identifier, of the project
            in which the job launched is to be included.
            When /PROJECT_ID is used with /NOTIFY, it specifies  a  project  which
            has been successfully started.


  /REPORT
  /NOREPORT (default)

          - If used, /REPORT specifies that a report operation  is  required  from
            LAMPSCONTROL.   When  it  begins  to  execute,  LAMPSCONTROL  will  go
            directly to the 'Main Report Menu', from which the user may select the
            required operation.


  /REQUEST
  /NOREQUEST (default)

          - If used, /REQUEST specifies that a task request operation is  required
            from  LAMPSCONTROL.   When used with /NOMENU, LAMPSCONTROL will select
            the highest priority project, job and task available to the user,  and
            create an appropriate jacket command procedure.  When used with /MENU,
            LAMPSCONTROL will enter the 'Project Request Menu', the  'Job  Request
            Menu'  or  the  'Task  Request  Menu',  as  appropriate  (see the main
            'Description' section below), to allow the next task to be chosen.

  /SESSION_ID=session-id
  /NOSESSION_ID (default)

          - The /SESSION_ID  qualifier  is  used  with  /NOTIFY  to  indicate  the
            termination of a session.  The 'session-id' is an integer value, which
            will assigned to the DCL symbol 'FLN_SESSION_ID' by the jacket command
            procedure  created  by  LAMPSCONTROL  to  carry  out  the session just
            terminated.


  /SESSION_RESULT=task-state
  /NOSESSION_RESULT (default)

          - The  /SESSION_RESULT  qualifier  is  used  with  /NOTIFY   to   inform
            LAMPSCONTROL  of  the result of a session.  The 'task-state' is one of
            the following keywords:

                 [1mCOMPLETE[0m     The session and task have finished successfully.
                 [1mCONTINUE[0m     The session has finished successfully, but the  task
                              is  not complete.  At least one more session will be
                              required to complete the task.
                 [1mRESTART[0m      The  session  has  terminated  with  some  sort   of
                              problem,  which  can  be rectified by restarting the
                              task.
                 [1mERROR[0m        The session has terminated with a problem which  can
                              only  be corrected with the intervention of a system
                              manager.
                 [1mOFFLINE[0m      The session is continuing with offline operations.
                 [1mSUBFLOWLINE[0m  The session has launched  a  number  of  jobs  on  a
                              subflowline.   The  task  will not be complete until
                              those jobs are complete.


  /WAIT_TIME=delta-time
  /NOWAIT_TIME (default)
          - This qualifier should only be used with /REQUEST  and  /NOMENU  during
            non-interactive  task  requesting.  It is used to specify the duration
            of the wait performed by a wait jacket command procedure when no  task
            can be found to perform.  The value associated with the qualifier is a
            standard DEC delta-time, with  the  usual  format  'DDDD  HH:MM:SS.CC'
            (where  DDDD  =  Number  of days; HH = Number of hours; MM = Number of
            minutes; SS = Number of seconds; CC = Decimal  fraction  of  seconds).
            The default time, if none is specified, is 1 minute.

  DESCRIPTION                                                      21 January 1993


  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDescription[0m

            To get the most out of  the  LAMPSCONTROL  documentation,  the  reader
            should  be  familiar with the concept of flowline systems as described
            in earlier chapters of this manual.  In order to set up a full  system
            including  the  command  procedure  files  to  perform  the operations
            required for project creation (the 'System'  command  procedure),  job
            launching   (the   'Flowline'   command   procedures),   elements  and
            procedures, the user must be  fully  versed  in  the  Digital  Command
            Language  (DCL) as described in the DEC 'VAX/VMS DCL Concepts Manual',
            'Guide to Using DCL and Command Procedures on VAX/VMS',  and  'VAX/VMS
            DCL  Dictionary'.   To  edit  these  command  procedures  from  within
            LAMPSCONTROL using the EDT editor, the user should  also  be  familiar
            with its operation as described in the 'VAX/VMS EDT Reference Manual'.

            LAMPSCONTROL is a utility to  allow  the  creation,  modification  and
            utilisation  of  a  flowline  system containing one or more flowlines.
            LAMPSCONTROL may operate in several modes, determined by  the  command
            qualifiers  used, and by the operations which the user and his current
            workstation  are  authorised  to  perform.   It  may  be   used   both
            interactively and non-interactively.

            LAMPSCONTROL maintains a relational database containing information on
            the  current  status and history of use of the flowline system.  Using
            this it ensures the correct sequencing of tasks performed by operators
            according to the defined flowlines.

            If LAMPSCONTROL is used with the /MENU qualifier, then it will operate
            in  its interactive mode.  When LAMPSCONTROL starts to execute it will
            first display a title page.  As the  title  page  is  being  displayed
            operator  and  workstation  authorisation  will  be  taking  place and
            progress messages indicating  this  will  appear.   Then  one  of  the
            following  will  occur,  as  determined by the other qualifiers on the
            command line:

            1.  When /NOTIFY is used, the notification function specified  by  the
                other  qualifiers  present will be performed.  This is essentially
                non-interactive and will be completed  without  use  of  menus  or
                forms.

            2.  When /MANAGE is specified without /CREATE_JOB in  the  interactive
                mode,  LAMPSCONTROL  will display the 'Main Management Menu'.  The
                user may then select one of the options.  If /CREATE_JOB  is  also
                used,  a job will be created as specified without interaction with
                the user.

            3.  When /REPORT is specified  in  the  interactive  mode,  the  'Main
                Report  Menu',  allowing the user to select a report operation, is
                displayed.

            4.  When /REQUEST is used with LAMPSCONTROL in the  interactive  mode,
                one  of  the  'Project  Request',  'Job Request' or 'Task Request'
                menus is displayed.  The user may then select a task, in a  chosen
                job and project, to perform.

  Description                                                      21 January 1993


            5.  When LAMPSCONTROL is used without any of /MANAGE, /NOTIFY, /REPORT
                or  /REQUEST,  the  'Overall  Control  Menu'  will  be  displayed,
                allowing the user to opt to access one  of  the  main  management,
                reporting or request menus for which he is authorised.


            In interactive mode LAMPSCONTROL is menu and form  driven,  using  the
            DEC Form Management System (FMS).  A detailed description of each menu
            and form is given below in the section  on  'Command  Menus  and  Data
            Entry Forms'.

            If LAMPSCONTROL is used with the /NOMENU qualifier  option,  no  title
            page,  menu  pages or forms are displayed, and the program operates in
            its non-interactive mode.  In this mode, LAMPSCONTROL will act in  one
            of the following ways:

            1.  If /NOTIFY is specified, there is little  difference  between  the
                interactive and non-interactive operation of LAMPSCONTROL.  In the
                non-interactive  mode  no  title  page  is  displayed.    If   the
                /PARAMETERS  qualifier  is  used on the command line, LAMPSCONTROL
                will enter a command driven mode to allow the definition of local,
                global and external parameters.  The definition of such parameters
                is described below in the  section  'Defining  Local,  Global  and
                External Parameters'.

            2.  If /REQUEST is used with LAMPSCONTROL in the non-interactive mode,
                the  highest  priority  task,  if any are available, for which the
                user on his current workstation is authorised, will  be  selected.
                A corresponding task jacket command procedure will be created, and
                LAMPSCONTROL will finish executing.  The user may  then  call  the
                jacket command procedure to perform the task.  The non-interactive
                requesting and performing of  tasks  may  be  done  by  a  command
                procedure,  executing in a batch job, authorised to carry out only
                non-interactive elements.  Appropriate non-interactive tasks could
                then  be  completed,  without  the  intervention of any operators,
                whenever such tasks became available.

            3.  /MANAGE should generally only be used in the interactive  mode  of
                operation unless /CREATE_JOB is also specified.  If /CREATE_JOB is
                present with /MANAGE then  no  user  interaction  is  required  to
                create  the  specified job, and the operation of LAMPSCONTROL will
                proceed as in the interactive mode, but without the display of any
                title page.

            4.  /REPORT should not be used in the non-interactive mode.

            5.  LAMPSCONTROL should not  be  used  without  any  of  the  /NOTIFY,
                /MANAGE or /REQUEST qualifiers in the non-interactive mode.


            LAMPSCONTROL stores the file specifications of any command  procedures
            relating  to  project  creation  (the 'System' command procedure), job
            launching (the 'Flowline' command procedures),  elements,  procedures,
            projects  and  jobs.   The  manager  is  able to edit any such command
            procedures from LAMPSCONTROL with the EDT editor, which he may opt  to
            use when creating or editing the system component definitions with the

  Description                                                      21 January 1993


            appropriate data entry forms,  or  when  modifying  or  examining  the
            statuses of the projects and jobs from the appropriate menus.

            When LAMPSCONTROL is used with the  /COMMAND_FILE  qualifier,  a  file
            containing  a  DCL  command  procedure,  known  as  a  'jacket command
            procedure', will be generated.

            It is recommended that every operator use a different  jacket  command
            procedure specification.  This avoids the confusion which can arise if
            two operators create  and  then  attempt  to  execute  jacket  command
            procedures  with  the  same  specification.   If  the  jacket  command
            procedure name is constructed from the operator's process name and the
            name of the cluster node for his current session, then a unique jacket
            command procedure file specification will  be  ensured  cluster  wide.
            This  is  because the process name must be unique on its node, and the
            node name must be different from all other node names on the cluster.

            More  details  about  the  jacket  command   procedures   written   by
            LAMPSCONTROL  are  given in the section 'Jacket Command Procedures and
            DCL Symbols'.

            When using LAMPSCONTROL interactively with the /REQUEST qualifier,  to
            select  the  next  task  to  perform, the user will have access to the
            three request menus, the 'Project  Request  Menu',  the  'Job  Request
            Menu'  and the 'Task Request Menu'.  The first menu displayed for user
            interaction, when LAMPSCONTROL begins to execute, is determined by the
            last project, job and task on which the user worked.

            If the user's last project and job are still  active,  then  the  user
            will  be  presented  with a task menu for that job, with the last task
            worked on, if it has not been completed, as the first option.  If  the
            user's last project is active, but the last job worked on is not, then
            the job menu for that project will be displayed.  If the last  project
            worked  on  by the user is no longer active then the project menu will
            presented by LAMPSCONTROL.

            Regardless of which  of  the  three  request  menus  is  entered  when
            LAMPSCONTROL  begins  to execute, the user will be free to move up and
            down the hierarchical project, job and task request menus by selecting
            the  appropriate options.  Further details of these menus are given in
            the section 'Command Menus and Data Entry Forms'.

  USE OF LAMPSCONTROL BY ORDINARY OPERATORS                        21 January 1993

            It is not intended that the ordinary 'operators', whose job it  is  to
            carry out the menial, repetitive operations associated with completing
            individual elements in a flowline  should  have  access  to  the  full
            functionality  of  LAMPSCONTROL.  Allowing this would defeat the whole
            purpose of LAMPSCONTROL, which is to ensure that well defined elements
            in  a  flowline  are  carried  out in a particular sequence and on the
            required datasets.  If an ordinary operator were  allowed  access  to,
            say,  the  management  menus,  then  he  could,  through  ignorance or
            mischievousness, interfere with the sequencing of tasks or  even  with
            the definition of the system.

            Instead, the operator should only be allowed access  to  the  project,
            job  and  task request menus.  This can be achieved by authorising the
            operator, with a given username, to perform  only  the  'Request'  and
            'Notify'  operations  on  the database.  That is, the operator will be
            authorised to use only the /REQUEST  and  /NOTIFY  command  qualifiers
            with LAMPSCONTROL.  Furthermore, the operator should always access the
            system through a captive command procedure, ideally part of, or called
            by,  his  login  command procedure.  This would call LAMPSCONTROL with
            the /REQUEST qualifier, taking the operator directly to a project, job
            or  task  request  menu.   The  captive  command  procedure would then
            execute any jacket command procedure generated  by  LAMPSCONTROL,  and
            would  loop  for  the  next  call  of LAMPSCONTROL with /REQUEST.  The
            operator could exit from  the  system  by  selecting  the  'Exit  from
            LAMPSCONTROL' option on the 'Project Request Menu'.

  [1mWorkstation[0m [1mIdentification[0m


            Access to LAMPSCONTROL is authorised in terms of both the name of  the
            user  and  the  identity  of  the  workstation involved.  LAMPSCONTROL
            expects the logical name LSL$FLN_WORKSTATION to be defined to give the
            identity of the current workstation.

            This may be done at any  time  before  LAMPSCONTROL  is  called.   For
            ordinary  operators,  it is advised that the definition occurs in some
            form of captive login command procedure  which  subsequently  executes
            LAMPSCONTROL.   This  prevents  the  definition of LSL$FLN_WORKSTATION
            being altered by the operator.

            If no translation for LSL$FLN_WORKSTATION is found, LAMPSCONTROL  will
            terminate its execution after displaying a suitable message.

            LAMPSCONTROL may generate one  of  a  number  of  DCL  command  files,
            referred  to  as  'jacket  command procedures', to perform the actions
            relating to an operation requested  from  it.   These  jacket  command
            procedures will access or assign a number of DCL symbols.

            When LAMPSCONTROL is used with the  /COMMAND_FILE  qualifier,  a  file
            containing  a  DCL  command procedure will be generated.  This command
            procedure may carry out the  following  functions,  depending  on  the
            command qualifiers and menu options selected by the user :

            1.  [1mProject[0m [1mCreation[0m [1mJacket[0m [1mCommand[0m [1mProcedure[0m
                When the 'Create a project' option is selected from  the  'Project
                and  Job  Creation  Menu',  a  'Project  creation'  jacket command
                procedure to execute the 'System' command  procedure  is  created.
                The system command procedure will perform the operations necessary
                for creating a new project, including creating a 'Project' command
                procedure  specific  to  that  project.  When the 'System' command
                procedure has finished executing,  the  jacket  command  procedure
                will    call   LAMPSCONTROL   with   the   /NOTIFY,   /PROJECT_ID,
                /CREATION_RESULT and /NEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE qualifiers to indicate
                the  successful  initiation  of  a project and inform the flowline
                control system  of  the  specification  of  the  project  specific
                command procedure.

                When the 'Create a job' option is selected from the  'Project  and
                Job Creation Menu', or when the /MANAGE and /CREATE_JOB qualifiers
                are used, a 'Job launching' jacket command procedure to execute  a
                'Flowline'  command procedure, specific to a flowline, is created.
                The  flowline  command  procedure  will  perform  the   operations
                necessary  for launching a job on the flowline, including creating
                a 'Job' command procedure specific to that job.  When the flowline
                command  procedure  has  finished  executing,  the  jacket command
                procedure  will  call  LAMPSCONTROL  with  the  /NOTIFY,  /JOB_ID,
                /CREATION_RESULT and /NEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE qualifiers to indicate
                the successful initiation of a job.

                /NOMENU), or by choosing one from the 'Task  Request  Menu',  then
                LAMPSCONTROL  will  create a 'Task' jacket command procedure.  The
                task jacket command procedure will execute the  relevant  project,
                job and element command procedures and will then call LAMPSCONTROL
                with the /NOTIFY, /SESSION_ID, /SESSION_RESULT, /PROBLEM, /OUTCOME
                and  /CPU  qualifiers to inform the flowline control system of the

                command  procedure  which will wait for a delta-time defined using
                the /WAIT_TIME command qualifier (defaulting to 1  minute).   This
                allows  non-interactive task selection requests to LAMPSCONTROL to
                be made from a command procedure in a continuous loop, which  will
                execute  any  jacket  command  procedure  created.   If no task is
                available, it will execute the 'Wait' command procedure  and  then
                retry  the  non-interactive  task  selection.  The use of a 'Wait'
                jacket command procedure  avoids  fruitless  non-interactive  task
                requests being repeated too frequently, which would waste computer
                resources.

                complete it, or if the user specifies the /NOLOGOFF  qualifier  in
                the   LAMPSCONTROL   command  line  and  selects  the  'Exit  from
                LAMPSCONTROL' option on the current top level menu, then a  'Null'
                jacket  command procedure is created.  This command procedure does
                nothing, except set  up  the  FLN_JACKET_TYPE  symbol  and  delete

                generated.  When executed this will advise the user that there  is

                original LAMPSCONTROL command line, then a 'Logoff' jacket command
                procedure will be created which, when executed, will terminate the
                user's current terminal session.

  Jacket Command Procedures and DCL Symbols                        21 January 1993


            The user should generally specify the /COMMAND_FILE qualifier so  that
            LAMPSCONTROL  creates  a command procedure, even if it is often a null
            command procedure.  Then, when LAMPSCONTROL  finishes  executing,  the
            user should call the command procedure which has been created.  A good
            way to do this is to write a command procedure  to  call  LAMPSCONTROL
            with  a command line containing a /COMMAND_FILE qualifier specifying a
            particular command filename unique to the current  user  and  process,
            and  to  follow  it  with a line to execute the command procedure just
            generated.  For example, an extract from a suitable command  procedure
            might be:

                  $!
                  $! Request non-interactive task selection by LAMPSCONTROL
                  $!
                  $       LAMPSCONTROL -
                                  /REQUEST -
                                  /NOMENU -
                                  /COMMAND_FILE = JON_JACKET.COM
                  $!
                  $! Now execute the jacket command procedure written by LAMPSCONTROL
                  $!
                  $       @JON1_JACKET.COM


            The jacket command procedures  written  by  LAMPSCONTROL  will  delete
            themselves once they have performed their operations.

            It is advised that each user has a  unique  jacket  command  procedure
            specification  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  one  user executing or
            deleting  another  user's  jacket   command   procedure.    For   more
            information on this, refer to the 'Description' section above.

            For those functions of LAMPSCONTROL which involve the execution  of  a
            non-null  jacket  command procedure, it can be seen that there are two
            calls made on LAMPSCONTROL.  The  first  call,  by  the  user,  causes
            LAMPSCONTROL  to  create  a  jacket  command procedure to carry out an
            operation.   LAMPSCONTROL  will  ensure  that  the  current  user   is
            authorised  to carry out the requested operation, and will then create
            a jacket command procedure.  The user then executes the jacket command
            procedure.   The  jacket  command  procedure  performs  the  necessary
            operations, and calls LAMPSCONTROL again, with the /NOTIFY  qualifier,
            to  indicate  the outcome of the operation.  Thus, in the case of task
            command  procedures,  LAMPSCONTROL  will  store  the  outcome   of   a
            particular  task  in  the  flowline system database, and, depending on
            that outcome, may schedule any subsequent tasks.

            Any DCL symbols to be examined by jacket command procedures should  be
            globally  assigned,  either  before  the  jacket  command procedure is
            executed, or by command procedures  called  from  the  jacket  command
            procedure.   For example, a jacket command procedure to perform a task
            will expect the element and  procedure  command  procedures  which  it
            calls to set up the FLN_RETURN, FLN_OUTCOME and FLN_PROBLEM symbols to
            indicate the termination status of the session.

  Jacket Command Procedures and DCL Symbols                        21 January 1993


            Any symbols set up by the jacket command procedures will  be  globally
            assigned,  and may be accessed by other command procedures called from
            them or after  them,  for  example  system,  flowline,  project,  job,
            element   or   procedure   command  procedures.   An  element  command
            procedure, say, should obtain the file specification for its procedure
            command procedure from the symbol FLN_PROCEDURE_COMPROC.

            No DCL symbols starting with the characters 'FLN_' should be  used  in
            the  user  defined  command  procedures  to  be called from the jacket
            command procedure, apart from those  described  below.   This  ensures
            that  no name clashes occur with symbols used internally by the jacket
            command procedures.

            The global DCL symbols involved are listed and described below:



            [1mFLN_CREATION_RESULT[0m

            This symbol contains a string keyword, which should be assigned in the
            'System'  (project  creation)  or  'Flowline'  (job launching) command
            procedure, and  should  indicate  the  success  or  otherwise  of  the
            procedure.
            The FLN_CREATION_RESULT symbol is used in constructing  a  project  or
            job   creation  jacket  command  procedure  LAMPSCONTROL  notification
            command line.  Its value is supplied to  the  /CREATION_RESULT  (q.v.)
            qualifier.  FLN_CREATION_RESULT should be assigned a string containing
            one of the keywords associated with /CREATION_RESULT, that is  one  of
            the following:

                 [1mSUCCESS[0m
                 [1mFAILURE[0m



            [1mFLN_ELEMENT_COMPROC[0m

            This is assigned by a task jacket command procedure  to  be  a  string
            containing   the   specification  of  the  element  command  procedure
            associated with the task.  The jacket command procedure will call  the
            element command procedure using the command line:

                 $     @'FLN_ELEMENT_COMPROC'



            [1mFLN_ELEMENT_ID[0m

            This is assigned by a task jacket command procedure  to  be  a  string
            containing the identifier of the element corresponding to that task.

            interactively.
            This symbol should be set up before the jacket  command  procedure  is
            executed.   If  the  jacket command procedure finds it is not defined,
            its value will be determined  with  the  DCL  lexical  function  call,

            [1mFLN_JOB_COMPROC[0m

            The  FLN_JOB_COMPROC  symbol  is  assigned,  as  a  string,  the  file
            specification of the current job's command procedure.
            When job launching  occurs,  the  flowline  command  procedure  should
            determine  the job command procedure specification by interaction with
            the user, and should assign it to  this  symbol;  the  jacket  command
            procedure   may   then   use   it  in  constructing  its  LAMPSCONTROL
            notification command line, with the /NEW_COMMAND_PROCEDURE qualifier.
            A  task  jacket  command  procedure  assigns  the  command   procedure
            specification for the job containing the current task to this symbol.



            [1mFLN_JOB_ID[0m

            This contains a string value representing the  integer  identifier  of
            the current job.  It is assigned by the task jacket command procedure.



            [1mFLN_JOB_NAME[0m

            This is assigned a string value representing the character job name of
            the current job.
            This symbol is set up by the job launching  and  task  jacket  command
            procedures.



            [1mFLN_LOCAL_PARAM[0m       local parameter list
            [1mFLN_GLOBAL_PARAM[0m      global parameter list
            [1mFLN_EXTERNAL_PARAM[0m    external parameter list

            These symbols can be assigned string values by any command  procedures
            executed  during  the  performance  of  a  session  within a task, for
            example,  they  may  be  set  up  by  element  or  procedure   command
            procedures.
            The values assigned to these symbols will be lists of local, global or
            external parameters for passing between tasks or sessions (see Chapter
            2).
            These symbols will be used by the task  jacket  command  procedure  to
            construct the parameter definition commands (see the section 'Defining
            Local, Global and External Parameters' below) as follows:

                 PARAMETER> [1mLOCAL[0m [1m<FLN_LOCAL_PARAM>[0m
                 PARAMETER> [1mGLOBAL[0m [1m<FLN_GLOBAL_PARAM>[0m
                 PARAMETER> [1mEXTERNAL[0m [1m<FLN_EXTERNAL_PARAM>[0m

            As an illustration of how  to  set  up  these  symbols,  consider  the
            requirement  to  set up the following local parameters (which will all
            be valid DCL statements) for inclusion in the next task jacket command
            procedure:

                 L1 = 1
                 L2 = "local2"
                 @plot

            To specify these local parameters, the procedure  or  element  command
            procedure   should  globally  assign  the  symbol  FLN_LOCAL_PARAM  as
            follows:

                 FLN_LOCAL_PARAM == """L1 = 1"",""L2 = """"local2"""""",""@plot"""

            This would result in the command, after  substitution  of  the  symbol
            FLN_LOCAL_PARAM:

                 PARAMETER> [1mLOCAL[0m [1m"L1[0m [1m=[0m [1m1","L2[0m [1m=[0m [1m""local2""","@plot"[0m

            The use of pairs of double quotes, within strings delimited by  double
            quotes, to signify single double quotes, should be noted.



            [1mFLN_MODE[0m

            This should assigned a keyword string  value  before  LAMPSCONTROL  is
            executed  to  create  a jacket command procedure.  Its value indicates
            the mode of operation of LAMPSCONTROL:

                 [1mBATCH[0m    non-interactive operation (task request, job launching)
                 [1mCONTROL[0m  entry through 'Overall Control Menu'
                 [1mMANAGE[0m   entry through 'Main Management Menu'
                 [1mOPERATE[0m  entry through 'Request Menus'
                 [1mREPORT[0m   entry through 'Main Report Menu'
                 [1mSLAVE[0m    operating interactively, but not from terminal session

            The final 'SLAVE' mode of operation occurs if LAMPSCONTROL executes in
            a  subprocess or from a batch job, but with input and output through a
            VT220 compatible device.
            If FLN_MODE is not  set  up  before  a  jacket  command  procedure  is
            executed,  then that jacket command procedure will assign it a default
            value, either 'OPERATE' or 'BATCH' depending on whether the  value  of
            FLN_INT is TRUE or FALSE respectively.



            [1mFLN_OPERATOR[0m

            This contains,  as  a  string  value,  the  username  of  the  current
            operator.  It is assigned by task jacket command procedure.

            These symbols are assigned string values by the job  launching  jacket
            command procedure.
            For jobs which are to  be  launched  on  subflowlines,  these  symbols
            contain  the element, flowline, procedure, and project identifiers and
            command  procedure  specifications,  and  the  job  name  and  command
            procedure  specification for the element, flowline, procedure, project
            and job enclosing the subflowline on which the job is to be launched.
            For jobs which are to be launched on ordinary flowlines, these symbols
            will be assigned null string values.
            It is thus possible to write a flowline command  procedure  which,  by
            checking  if  these  symbols have null values, can carry out different
            operations for launching jobs on its flowline as a full flowline or as
            a subflowline.



            [1mFLN_OUTCOME[0m

            This symbol should be assigned a string representation of the  integer
            outcome  value  of a completed task.  The assignment should be carried
            out by the element or procedure command procedures.   The  FLN_OUTCOME
            symbol   will  be  used  by  the  task  jacket  command  procedure  in
            constructing  the  LAMPSCONTROL  command  line  to  notify  a  session
            termination.



            [1mFLN_PROBLEM[0m

            This symbol should be assigned a string containing a brief description
            of  the  nature of the problem when a session terminates in 'ERROR' or
            'RESTART' conditions.  The assignment should be  carried  out  by  the
            element  or  procedure  command procedure.  The symbol will be used by
            the task jacket command procedure  in  constructing  the  LAMPSCONTROL
            command line to notify a session termination.

            [1mFLN_PROJECT_COMPROC[0m

            The FLN_PROJECT_COMPROC symbol  will  hold,  as  a  string,  the  file
            specification  of  the  current  project's  command  procedure.   When
            project creation occurs, the system command procedure should determine
            the  project  command  procedure specification by interaction with the
            user, and  should  assign  it  to  this  symbol;  the  jacket  command
            procedure   may   then   use   it  in  constructing  its  LAMPSCONTROL
            notification command line.



            [1mFLN_PROCEDURE_COMPROC[0m

            This symbol is  assigned  the  file  specification  of  the  procedure
            command  procedure  required  for  the  current  task by a task jacket
            command procedure.  The element  command  procedure  should  call  the

            This symbol is used in constructing a task jacket command  procedure's
            LAMPSCONTROL  notification command line.  Its value is supplied to the
            /SESSION_RESULT (q.v.) qualifier.  FLN_RESULT  should  be  assigned  a
            string containing one of the keywords associated with /SESSION_RESULT,
            that is one of the following :

                 [1mCOMPLETE[0m

                 [1mSUBFLOWLINE[0m

            This assignment should occur  in  the  element  or  procedure  command
            procedure, and should indicate the termination status of the session.



            [1mFLN_SESSION_ID[0m

            This symbol is assigned a  string  value  by  a  task  jacket  command

            online resumption of a session which has  just  completed  an  offline
            phase.  Its possible values are:

                 [1mNEW[0m       This is a new session.
                 [1mOFFLINE[0m   This is the online resumption of an existing session.

            command procedure.



            [1mFLN_TASK_ID[0m

            This symbol is assigned, by  the  task  jacket  command  procedure,  a
            string  representation  of  the integer task identifier of the current
            task.



            [1mFLN_TASK_STATUS[0m

            This symbol is assigned, by  the  task  jacket  command  procedure,  a
            string  indicating the initial task status.  That is, whether the task
            is being freshly started, or whether one or more  sessions  have  been
            performed as part of it.  The possible values are:

                 [1mNEW[0m       This is the first session connected with this task.
                 [1mSTARTED[0m   One or more sessions have been  performed  already  for

            If the /PARAMETERS qualifier is used in the command line  for  session
            termination  notification,  then  LAMPSCONTROL will, when it begins to
            execute, enter a command driven mode to allow the definition of up  to
            16  of  each  (48  in total) of the 3 types of session/task parameters
            (local, global and external).

            For more information on the nature and  usage  of  local,  global  and
            external parameters, refer to Chapter 2.

            The commands available in this mode are:



            [1mEXIT[0m

            If this command is used, the command driven mode will  be  terminated,
            and  LAMPSCONTROL  will  continue  with its execution to carry out the
            notification of the end of the session.



            [1mEXTERNAL[0m [1mstring-list[0m

            This command is used to specify a list of external parameters.



            [1mGLOBAL[0m [1mstring-list[0m

            This command is used to specify a list of global parameters.



            [1mLOCAL[0m [1mstring-list[0m

            This command is used to specify a list of local parameters.



            The 'string-list' argument for the above commands consists of  a  list
            of  strings  separated  by spaces or commas.  If any string contains a
            space or a comma, it must be delimited by double  quotes  (").   If  a
            double  quote  is  required  in any string delimited by double quotes,
            that double quote should be represented a pair of double quotes.  Each
            item  in  the  'string-list'  will become a parameter, and should thus
            constitute a valid DCL statement.

            It is possible to achieve the substitution  of  the  value  of  a  DCL
            symbol  for  part  or  all  of the 'string-list' argument.  If the DCL
            symbol name should  be  included  in  the  required  position  in  the
            argument,  delimited  by  '<' at the start, and '>' at the end, of the
            name.

            LAMPSCONTROL, when operating interactively, allows the user to  choose
            the  next operation to perform and to enter any relevant data by means
            of a number of FMS screen menus and forms.

            Note that the dashed lines delimiting the form and menu examples below
            do not appear in the actual screen forms and menus.



            The 'current' option on a menu is understood to be the option  on  the
            line  on  which the cursor is positioned.  That is, the line currently
            highlighted in reverse video.

            The following keys may be used to select options on menus:

               [1mReturn[0m      Selects the current option.  This will be the option on
                           the line on which the cursor is currently positioned.

               [1mUp arrow[0m    Moves to the option above the current one.   Moving  up
                           from the top item will jump to the bottom item.

               [1mDown arrow[0m  Moves to the option below the current one.  Moving down
                           from  the  bottom item on the menu will jump to the top
                           item.

               [1mPF2[0m         This is the help key.  For  most  menus,  pressing  the
                           help  key will cause a help form to be displayed on the
                           screen.  Frequently, there is more help text  than  can
                           be fitted onto a single form, so it is broken up into a
                           number of forms which may be viewed consecutively.  The
                           user  may  move  from  one  help  form  to  the next by
                           pressing the help key.  The  user  may  return  to  the
                           original  menu, from any of the help forms, by pressing
                           the ENTER key.

               [1mCTRL W[0m      Refreshes (i.e.  redisplays) the current menu.



            Each menu will consist of one or more options.  These may  be  divided
            into  two categories, options which are specific to a particular menu,
            and the 'standard' options  common  to  most  of  the  menus  used  by
            LAMPSCONTROL.  These generally applicable standard options are:

            1.  [1mMove[0m [1mup[0m [1mto[0m [1m'higher[0m [1mlevel'[0m [1mmenu[0m
                This option would be found on menus  which  were  displayed  as  a
                result  of selecting an option on another menu.  It can be used to
                move up through a hierarchy of menus.  The phrase  'higher  level'
                will  usually  be  replaced on the menu option with the name, or a
                description of, the menu which would be displayed by selecting it.
                This option will not be found  on  the  top  level  menu  for  the
                current  activation  of  LAMPSCONTROL (see description of 'Jump to

                This option is present on most menus.   Selecting  it  causes  the
                menu  at  the  top  of  the  hierarchy of menus, through which the
                current menu was reached, to be displayed.
                Exactly which menu this is depends on the combination  of  command
                qualifiers used with LAMPSCONTROL.
                If /MANAGE was used, the 'Main Management Menu' is the  top  level
                menu.
                If /REPORT was used, the 'Main Report Menu' is the top level menu.
                If /REQUEST was used, the 'Project Request Menu' is the top  level
                menu.
                If none of /REQUEST, /REPORT or /MANAGE  was  used,  the  'Overall
                Control Menu' is the top level menu.
                This option is omitted from a menu if the effect of  selecting  it
                would  be  the  same  as  that of selecting the 'Move up to higher
                level menu' option, or, obviously, if the menu is  the  top  level
                menu.

            3.  [1mExit[0m [1mfrom[0m [1mLAMPSCONTROL[0m
                This option is present on the LAMPSCONTROL top level menu (see the
                previous  item).   Selecting  it  causes  LAMPSCONTROL to create a
                suitable command procedure ('logoff' if /LOGOFF was used or 'null'
                if /NOLOGOFF was used), and then to finish executing.

                displayed  in  a  single screenful, this option will be displayed.
                By selecting it the user can move forwards  through  the  list  of
                menu  options,  to  examine  a fresh page of alternatives.  If the
                current menu page represents the end  of  the  option  list,  this
                option will not be displayed.

                By selecting it the user can move backwards through  the  list  of
                menu  options,  to  examine  a fresh page of alternatives.  If the
                current menu page represents the start of the  option  list,  this
                option will not be displayed.


            The standard options above will not be  described  in  the  individual
            sections below relating to particular menus.

            Any user able to access a particular menu will be authorised to select
            or perform all the options displayed on it.



            In each  example  of  the  forms  below,  the  presence  of  underline
            characters,  '_', indicates an area into which the user is expected to
            type a field value.  This is also true of the forms displayed  on  the
            screen.   On the screen, the field into which any character typed will
            be placed is indicated by the position of the cursor and  will  appear

            The following keys may be used to control movement between, and  entry
            of data into, forms and fields:

               [1mTabulate[0m    Advances the cursor to the  next  field  in  the  form.
                           Attempting  to advance forward from the last field on a
                           form will result in the message [1m'No[0m [1mnext[0m [1mfield[0m [1mon[0m [1mform'[0m

                           form.   If  an  attempt  is  made to move back from the
                           first field on a form, the message [1m'No[0m  [1mprevious[0m  [1mfield[0m

               [1mLine Feed[0m   Deletes the contents of the current field.

               [1mReturn[0m      Exits from a form.  Any data entered will be  acted  on
                           by  LAMPSCONTROL.   It  is  not possible to exit from a
                           form unless data for all  mandatory  fields  have  been
                           entered.

               [1mPF2[0m         This is the help key.  For  most  fields  on  the  data
                           entry  forms,  pressing the key once will cause details
                           of the format and type of data required for that  field
                           to be displayed on the bottom line of the screen.
                           For most forms, pressing the help key twice,  over  any
                           field,  will  cause  a help form to be displayed on the

                           be fitted onto a single form, so it is broken up into a

            Some forms contain 'scrolled areas'.  These areas consist of a  number
            of identical and consecutive lines on the form, containing one or more
            fields, which can be scrolled to allow the user to enter a 'table'  of
            data  of  virtually  unlimited length.  Movement between fields on the
            same line of the scrolled area  is  controlled  in  the  same  way  as
            movement between fields on ordinary areas of the form (with 'tabulate'
            and 'back space').  The user will enter the scrolled  area  by  moving
            forwards  as  normal  from  the  field immediately preceding the area.
            Movement out of the scrolled areas, and between lines of the  scrolled
            area is controlled using the following key sequences:

               [1mGOLD Up arrow[0m    Moves  the  cursor  to  the  field  preceding  the
                                scrolled area.

               [1mGOLD Down arrow[0m  Moves  the  cursor  to  the  field  following  the
                                scrolled area.

               [1mUp arrow[0m         Moves the cursor to the line of the scrolled  area
                                preceding the current one.

               [1mDown arrow[0m       Moves the cursor to the line of the scrolled  area
                                following the current one.

            Movement within a field, for editing purposes, is  controlled  by  the
            back  arrow  (to  move to the right) and forward arrow (to move to the
            left) keys.

            On some forms, default values will initially appear  in  some  of  the
            fields.  These may be edited as required by the user.

            On certain menus  and  forms,  certain  'GOLD  sequences'  -  that  is
            pressing  the GOLD (PF1) key followed by some other key - have special
            uses.  Details  of  these  are  given  in  individual  menu  and  form
            descriptions.

            for which the user on his current workstation is authorised.

            For example, a user authorised only for the request  menus,  would  be
            presented  with  only  one  option,  in  addition  to  the  'Exit from
            LAMPSCONTROL' option, namely 'Project, Job and Task Request Menu'.

            Typing 'GOLD D' will cause the user to be prompted to make  sure  that
            this  operation is really required.  If the response is 'Y' for 'Yes',
            the project will  be  deleted.   That  is,  all  the  data  about  the
            project's history, including the histories of the jobs and tasks which
            it contained, which is used in preparing  reports  about  the  system,
            will be deleted from the database.  This option can only be applied to

            Typing 'GOLD H' will change the  status  of  the  current  project  to

            sessions  or tasks being started in the project.  The user may proceed
            to modify the statuses of any jobs or tasks in the project.
            This key sequence has no effect  if  the  project  status  is  already

            This menu is entered  after  a  job  has  been  selected,  for  moving
            backwards in its flowline, on the 'Job Status Modification Menu'.

            The options on the 'Element Selection for Job Movement  Menu'  consist
            of  elements  through  which the job has already passed.  The user may
            select one or more of the elements and attempt to have the  job  moved
            back to them.

            Moving a job backwards can be used, for example, to attempt to correct
            an  error  which has occurred in the job's processing by repositioning
            it at an earlier stage in the flowline  than  that  which  caused  the
            error.

            More than one element can be selected to allow  for  repositioning  in
            flowlines containing several parallel paths.

            When one or more elements have been selected, and the user types 'GOLD
            M',  LAMPSCONTROL will attempt to move the job to the chosen elements.
            If this attempt fails, for example because an  impossible  combination
            of  elements  has  been selected, the user will have an opportunity to
            alter the selection and try again.

            This appears when the user opts to skip a  task.   The  value  entered
            should  be one of the possible integers which would have been returned
            by the relevant element command procedure  (in  FLN_OUTCOME)  had  the
            task  been  executed  and  completed  successfully.  The outcome value
            determines which of the possible following tasks  will  be  initiated.
            If  RETURN  is pressed without entering a number, then the task is not
            skipped.

            skipping operation.  It allows the user to choose whether to enter any
            local, global or external parameters associated with the task.  If the
            user   replies   'Y'   for  'Yes',  the  'Local  Parameters',  'Global
            Parameters' and 'External Parameters' forms will be displayed in  that

            replies 'N' for 'No' in response to the prompt, the task skipping will
            be performed with no parameters.

            This  menu  will  be  displayed  following  the   selection   of   the
            'Notification  (project, job, session)' option on the 'Main Management
            Menu'.

            The 'Project, Job and Session Notification Menu' allows  the  user  to
            select  which  sort  of notification operation he wishes to carry out.
            The three available options reflect the three  forms  of  the  use  of
            LAMPSCONTROL with the /NOTIFY command qualifier, that is to notify the
            termination of a session, the start of a project or  the  start  of  a
            job.

            This menu will be generally be used  by  the  manager  to  simulate  a
            notify  operation which should have been carried out by a LAMPSCONTROL
            created jacket command procedure, but  which  was  prevented  by  some
            system malfunction, for example a computer crash.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

            The 'Project Request Menu' is one of the three request menus which  an
            ordinary  operator  will  use to select the next task to be performed.
            The other two request menus are the 'Job Request Menu' and  the  'Task
            Request  Menu'.  One of the three request menus will be displayed as a
            result of selecting the 'Project, Job and Task Request  Menus'  option
            on the 'Overall Control Menu', or when LAMPSCONTROL is executed with a
            command line including the /REQUEST  and  /MENU  qualifiers.   Exactly
            which  of the three menus will be displayed first is determined by the
            last project, job and task performed by the user - for more details on
            this,  the  reader  should  refer  to  the  main 'Description' section
            earlier in this chapter.

            By selecting a project with this menu, the user modifies  his  current
            project  to  the  one  selected,  and  will  obtain access to the 'Job
            Request Menu' to select a job and then, from the 'Task Request  Menu',
            a task to perform.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

            The 'Task Request Menu' is one of the three  request  menus  which  an
            ordinary  operator  will  use to select the next task to be performed.
            The other two request  menus  are  the  'Job  Request  Menu'  and  the
            'Project  Request  Menu'.   One  of  the  three  request menus will be
            displayed as a result of selecting the 'Project, Job and Task  Request
            Menus'  option  on the 'Overall Control Menu', or when LAMPSCONTROL is
            executed  with  a  command  line  include  the  /REQUEST   and   /MENU
            qualifiers.   Exactly  which  of  the three menus will be displayed is
            determined by the last project, job and task performed by the  user  -
            for  more  details  on  this,  the  reader  should  refer  to the main
            'Description' section earlier in this chapter.

            By selecting a task with this menu,  the  user  modifies  his  current
            project  to  the  one  selected, and causes LAMPSCONTROL to attempt to
            start a session as part of the task.  If this attempt succeeds, a task
            jacket  procedure,  as described earlier, will be created to carry out
            the session for the task.  If the attempt to start the session  fails,
            the  user  will  be  returned  to this menu, to allow the selection of
            another task.

            Attempts to start sessions may fail because, between the time when the
            'Task Request Menu' was displayed, and the time when the user selected
            a task to perform, the chosen task was selected, and a session for  it
            started, by another user.

            fields of the form.

            The authorisation details are entered in a scrolled area of the  form.
            A  single  authorisation record (one line of the scrolled area) may be
            deleted by typing the  key  sequence  'GOLD  D'  when  the  cursor  is

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.

  These messages appear on the last two lines of the terminal screen when  a  menu
  or form is currently displayed.  They are all accompanied by an audible warning.
  Since they are associated with the menu mode of operation of LAMPSCONTROL,  they
  will not occur when /NOMENU is used on the command line.

  They are designed to:

     - Tell the user what to do next.

     - Inform the user of any invalid or potentially invalid field entries.

     - Inform the user of what the LAMPSCONTROL utility is doing.

     - Describe any errors which the LAMPSCONTROL utility has encountered.

  The messages associated with each form have been described earlier.

  Other messages are generated by FMS, the most significant being :

       In most of the forms, there are  fields,  or  sub-fields,  which  can  only
       contain  numeric  characters or can only contain alphabetic characters.  In
       such cases, an attempt to enter a character of the wrong type  will  result
       in an error message being displayed.

  The FLOWLINE package uses a library of routines to access the FLOWLINE database.
  These  FLOWLINE  library routines issue messages having the prefix 'FLN__'.  The
  messages are as follows:

  BADRESET, Illegal combination of Elements

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An attempt has been made to reset a job on a flowline with  an
      illegal  combination  of  elements.   Normally  this  occurs  if  one of the
      specified elements lies on the same flowline path as another.   Resetting  a
      job  to these elements would result in the completion of a task activating a
      subsequent task which has already been done.
