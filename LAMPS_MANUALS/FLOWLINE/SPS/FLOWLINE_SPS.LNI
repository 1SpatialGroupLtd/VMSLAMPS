  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan flowline control and management (FLOWLINE)  package  operates  on
  Digital  Equipment  VAX  and MicroVAX series computers running the VMS operating
  system.  See later sections for details of hardware and software  prerequisites.
  It  is  recommended that the reader becomes familiar with the "LAMPS Environment
  Guide" which outlines in some  detail  the  hardware  and  software  environment
  required by the LAMPS package.  LAMPS is the [1mL[0maser-Scan [1mA[0mutomated [1mM[0map [1mP[0mroduction
  [1mS[0mystem.

  FLOWLINE is the Laser-Scan flowline database and control package and provides  a
  flexible  system  for  the  management  of  a computer based flowline.  Flowline
  operations are carried out by means of DCL (DIGITAL  command  language)  command
  procedures  which  are  invoked  automatically  under  FLOWLINE  control.  These
  command procedures are created independently from flowline database  definition.
  Thus  the  system is not restricted to a specific application, and indeed may be
  used to manage more than one flowline simultaneously.

  The system may be used for the  implementation  of  flowlines  using  Laser-Scan
  LAMPS  mapping  software  for applications such as map digitising and editing or
  digital terrain modelling.  It is, also, sufficiently  general  to  control  any
  other production flowline driven DCL command procedures.

  The FLOWLINE package is comprehensively  documented  in  the  "FLOWLINE  Package
  Manual",  where  details  of  its  set-up,  operation  and  system responses are
  provided.




  2  [3m[1mFACILITIES[0m

  The FLOWLINE package comprises a relational database and a  controlling  program
  module  called  LAMPSCONTROL.   All management and operator interaction with the
  database may  be  achieved  using  LAMPSCONTROL.   The  following  features  are
  offered:

        o  facilities for the definition of a  production  flowline  in  terms  of
           concepts depicted on a flow diagram

        o  automatic recording of the start and completion of flowline tasks

        o  task sequencing according to the pre-determined flowline definition

        o  operator selection of currently required flowline tasks  known  to  the
           system

        o  A DCL command file structure which minimises the  need  for  operator's
           in-depth  knowledge  or  initiative.  Such details as filenames, system
           parameters and so on can be provided automatically by the system.

        o  extensive flowline management facilities

        o  full reporting facilities of flowline status and performance

        o  screen menu, screen form and command qualifier input

        o  VMS format messages referenced using 32 bit condition code symbols

        o  assured database integrity, in the event of a system crash

        o  error recovery procedures

        o  flexible operator and workstation authorisation facilities  to  control
           the security of access to specified system components

  The FLOWLINE package runs under VAX/VMS Version 5.4-3 (or  later  versions)  and
  assumes  upwards  compatibility  by  DEC.   The  LAMPSCONTROL  module may be run
  concurrently with other interactive and batch processes.

  The following two DEC software products also required to  be  installed  on  the
  system.

        *  The DEC relational database system VAX Rdb/VMS Version 4.0 (or higher).

        *  The DEC Form Management System VAX FMS Version 2.3 (or higher).

  It is recommended that the reader becomes familiar with  the  LAMPS  Environment
  Guide  which  outlines  in  greater detail the hardware and software environment
  required by the LAMPS package.

  An understanding of the creation and use of DCL command procedures is  necessary
  to obtain best and most flexible use of the facilities provided in FLOWLINE.

  Laser-Scan offers consultancy services, which may be utilised to develop turnkey
  flowline  systems  for specific customer applications.  Additionally, specialist
  training courses in the operation of  Laser-Scan  systems  and  DCL  programming
  techniques can be arranged upon resquest.
