  1  [1mINTRODUCTION[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan Package
  MATRIX.

  MATRIX is a package of utilities that operate on data held in a  Laser-Scan  DTI
  (Digital  Terrain  Image)  format.   The  utilities  allow the manipulation (eg.
  rotation ), and viewing of grid data.  The package includes a 3-D viewing module
  DTIVIEW,  and  the  modules  DTI2TEXT, DTICOMBINE, DTIEDIT, DTIROTATE, DTIBLEND,
  DTITILE, DTICONVERT and DTIPATCH.  All modules will be demonstrated as  part  of
  acceptance.



  2  [1mOVERVIEW[0m

  For the purpose of acceptance, 2 geographically adjoining  DTMs  will  be  used.
  These  will  be  combined  into  a single DTM during acceptance.  In addition, 2
  matrices with edge discontinuities are provided for the acceptance of the module
  DTIBLEND.

  Acceptance will be performed using a supplied DCL command  procedure  to  invoke
  the  modules  of  the  package.   The  command  procedure  is  invoked by typing
  [1m@LSL$COM:MATRIX_ACCEPT[0m

  A Laser-Scan supported colour display and a hardcopy line printer  are  required
  for  the  full testing of the MATRIX package.  You will be asked to confirm that
  graphical output is to a VAX workstation,  and  if  you  are  using  a  4  plane
  graphics screen.  You should answer no to this question if you are on a normal 8
  plane graphics screen.



  3  [1mDESCRIPTION OF ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE[0m

  Acceptance for DTITILE is carried out first.

  Acceptance of DTITILE begins by viewing the 2 input DTI files  on  the  graphics
  device using DTIVIEW.  The quarter screen and isometric 3-D viewing options will
  be  used  for  this  purpose.   It  should  be  noted  that  the  files   adjoin
  geographically.

  DTITILE will be used to produce a single DTI file from the 2 input  files.   The
  output file will be viewed in DTIVIEW using a full screen and the isometric view
  operation to confirm the successful merging, and correct  geographical  position
  of the data.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The use of the editor DTIEDIT will be demonstrated on the merged  DTI  file.   A
  copy  of  the  file  will  be  taken  before calling DTIEDIT since any edits are
  performed 'in situ'.

  Interaction with the displayed grid data via the keypad keys  ie.   movement  of
  the screen cursor around the display and the various modes of editing (ie.single
  point, line and area) will be shown.  A number of edits involving changes to the
  data  values,  will  be  performed  on  the file.  Output of a small part of the


  [1mMATRIX[0m [1mAcceptance[0m [1mtests[0m                                                   Page 3


  matrix  in  a  classified  form  to  a  line  printer  (if  available)  will  be
  demonstrated.

  For acceptance of  DTIEDIT,  commands  must  be  entered  interactively  at  the
  terminal.    In   response   to   the   prompt   [1mDTIEDIT>[0m   first   type  [1mFILEIN[0m
  [1mMATRIX_ACCEPT_COPY<CR>[0m to select the input DTI  file.   Type  [1mSHOW[0m  [1mFILE<CR>[0m  to
  print  details derived from the header of the DTI file.  Type [1mENABLE[0m [1mEDIT<CR>[0m so
  that the matrix values can be subsequently edited.  Type [1mCHANGE<CR>[0m  to  display
  the  data  in  a  classified  form (as a series of characters) on the screen.  A
  different character is used for each separate value step.  Character [1mA[0m  is  used
  to  represent  a  value  at  the bottom of the range; character [1mZ[0m to represent a
  value at the top of the range.

  Following the display of the matrix on the screen, the keypad keys (on the right
  of  the keyboard), may be used to move the screen cursor around the display, and
  to edit the matrix data.

  Repeatedly pressing the keypad key [1m6[0m will move the cursor to the right; pressing
  the  keypad  key  [1m8[0m will move the cursor up; pressing the keypad key [1m2[0m will move
  the cursor down, while pressing the keypad key [1m4[0m will move  the  cursor  to  the
  left.   The  z  value  at  the cursor position is displayed on the bottom of the
  screen, and will change as the cursor is moved.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  To edit a single matrix point to a new value, press the keypad key [1m-[0m.  You  will
  be  prompted  for a z value.  Enter a new value using the numeric keyboard keys.
  For example type [1m700<CR>[0m.  Move the cursor away and back again,  to  check  this
  value.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  To edit a line of values, press the keypad key [1m.[0m  and then use the keypad key  [1m8[0m
  several  times to pull out a line in reverse video.  Press the keypad key [1m-[0m, and
  enter a new value in response to the prompt on the terminal.  Press [1m<CR>[0m.   Note
  that all matrix points along the line are changed to this value.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  To edit an area of values, press the keypad key [1m.[0m  and then use the keypad  keys
  [1m8[0m and [1m6[0m to pull out an area in reverse video.  Press the keypad key [1m-[0m, and enter
  a new value in response to the prompt on the terminal.  Press [1m<CR>[0m.   Note  that
  all matrix points in the selected rectangle are changed to this value.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  To exit from screen mode, and return to the [1mDTIEDIT[0m prompt,  type  [1mCtrl/Z[0m  (hold
  down the Ctrl key and type Z).

  If a line printer  is  available,  then  acceptance  proceeds  by  outputting  a
  classified  listing of the matrix to the lineprinter.  Type [1mPRINT[0m [1m100[0m [1m100<CR>[0m to
  output 100 columns and 100 rows of the matrix to the printer.

  Type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m to exit from DTIEDIT.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m


  [1mMATRIX[0m [1mAcceptance[0m [1mtests[0m                                                   Page 4


  Acceptance of the module DTIBLEND is carried out next.  DTIBLEND will be used to
  edge  match  2  input  DTI  files  to  avoid value discontinuities at the matrix
  adjoining edge.  Both the input DTI files are smoothed in-situ to a common  mean
  along the adjoining edge.

  The module DTIEDIT will be used to examine each of the input files in turn.   To
  examine  the  first  input  file, type the following commands in response to the
  prompt [1mDTIEDIT>[0m

  [1mFILEIN[0m [1mMATRIX_ACCEPTL<CR>[0m
  [1mORIGIN[0m [1m80[0m [1m1<CR>[0m
  [1mCHANGE<CR>[0m


  The matrix will now be displayed on the screen as a series of  characters.   The
  edge  which  is to be blended is on the right of the screen.  Move the cursor to
  the righthand column by repeatedly pressing the keypad key [1m6[0m.  Move  the  cursor
  vertically up this column by repeatedly pressing the keypad key [1m8[0m, or vertically
  down the first column by repeatedly pressing the keypad key [1m2[0m.   The  height  of
  the  matrix  node  at the current cursor position will be shown on the bottom of
  the screen.  Note a few x,y,z values along the edge so that they can be compared
  with the file resulting from the blend process.

  To exit from DTIEDIT type [1mCtrl/Z[0m (hold down the Ctrl key and type Z),  and  then
  in response to the [1mDTIEDIT>[0m prompt type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m.

  The second input file should be similarly  examined  using  DTIEDIT.   Type  the
  following commands in response to the prompt [1mDTIEDIT>[0m

  [1mFILEIN[0m [1mMATRIX_ACCEPTR<CR>[0m
  [1mORIGIN[0m [1m1[0m [1m1<CR>[0m
  [1mCHANGE<CR>[0m


  The edge which is to be blended is on the  left  of  the  screen.   Examine  and
  record  a  number of x,y,z values along this edge using the keypad keys [1m8[0m and [1m2[0m.
  This allows comparison with the file resulting from the blend process.

  To exit from DTIEDIT type [1mCtrl/Z[0m (hold down the Ctrl key and type Z),  and  then
  in response to the [1mDTIEDIT>[0m prompt type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m.

  After examining the pre-blended files, DTIBLEND will now be used  to  blend  the
  DTI files to the mean Z values along the common edge.

  DTIEDIT should again be used to examine each blended file in turn, in  order  to
  confirm  the  success  of  the blend operation.  To examine the left side of the
  join, type the  following  sequence  of  commands  in  response  to  the  prompt
  [1mDTIEDIT>[0m.

  [1mFILEIN[0m [1mMATRIX_ACCEPTL_BLENDED<CR>[0m
  [1mORIGIN[0m [1m80[0m [1m1<CR>[0m
  [1mCHANGE<CR>[0m


  The edge that has been blended is on the  right  of  the  screen.   Examine  and
  record  the  x,y,z  values  along  this  edge using the keypad keys [1m8[0m and [1m2[0m that
  correspond to the ones previously recorded  for  the  unblended  lefthand  edge.

  Compare the two sets of z values.

  To exit from DTIEDIT type [1mCtrl/Z[0m (hold down the Ctrl key and type Z),  and  then
  in response to the [1mDTIEDIT>[0m prompt type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m.

  To examine the right side of the join, type the following sequence  of  commands
  in response to the prompt [1mDTIEDIT>[0m.

  [1mFILEIN[0m [1mMATRIX_ACCEPTR_BLENDED<CR>[0m

  [1mCHANGE<CR>[0m


  The edge that has been blended is on the left of the screen.  Examine and record
  the  x,y,z  values along this edge using the keypad keys [1m8[0m and [1m2[0m that correspond
  to the ones previously recorded for the unblended righthand edge.   Compare  the
  two sets of z values.

  To exit from DTIEDIT type [1mCtrl/Z[0m (hold down the Ctrl key and type Z),  and  then
  in response to the [1mDTIEDIT>[0m prompt type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The module DTICOMBINE will be used to compare  the  edited  DTI  file  with  the
  original.   Differences  between  the values in the 2 files, will be output to a
  'differences' DTI file.  This file will  be  converted  to  a  text  format  and
  printed on the screen using DTI2TEXT in the next stage of acceptance.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  DTI2TEXT will be used to convert the DTI binary data in the  'differences'  file
  to  an  ASCII  representation.  The window option in the program will be used to
  restrict this operation to a small part of the DTI file.  The text file will  be
  listed on the terminal screen.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The edited DTI file will be used as input to DTIROTATE.  DTIROTATE will be  used
  to  modify the header to indicate to subsequent programs that the data should be
  interpreted as  rotated  by  90  degrees  so  that  the  columns  and  rows  are
  transposed.   DTIEDIT  will  be  used  to confirm the successful rotation of the
  matrix.  The print option will be used to allow comparison  with  the  unrotated
  DTI file.

  To examine the rotated  matrix  in  DTIEDIT,  type  the  following  commands  in
  response  to  the  prompt  [1mDTIEDIT>[0m [1mFILEIN[0m [1mMATRIX_ACCEPT_ROT<CR>[0m will select the
  rotated DTI file.  You will see a message  about  non-standard  data  origin  or
  direction  values,  telling  you that unexpected results are very likely and may
  occur.   As  this  is  an  intentionally  rotated  file  this  can  be  ignored.
  [1mCHANGE<CR>[0m will display the matrix as a series of characters on the screen.  The
  values may now be examined  using  the  keypad  keys  as  described  above.   If
  possible  compare  the  values  with  the  hardcopy listing of the matrix before
  rotation, and the note that the columns and rows are transposed.

  To exit from screen mode, and return to the [1mDTIEDIT[0m prompt,  type  [1mCtrl/Z[0m  (hold
  down the Ctrl key and type Z).

  If a line printer  is  available,  then  acceptance  proceeds  by  outputting  a
  classified  listing of the matrix to the lineprinter.  Type [1mPRINT[0m [1m100[0m [1m100<CR>[0m to
  output 100 columns and 100 rows of the matrix to the printer.

  The module DTIPATCH will be used to examine and edit  the  metre  grid  interval
  values   in   the  DTI  header.   The  commands  to  DTIPATCH  must  be  entered
  interactively at  the  terminal  in  response  to  a  series  of  prompts.   For
  acceptance the following sequence of commands should be entered:

  [1mMATRIX_ACCEPT_ROT<CR>[0m
  [1m<CR>[0m
  [1m<CR>[0m

  The module DTICONVERT is used to convert between  different  DTI  file  formats.
  The conversion of the elevation data in the DTI file from integer word values to
  real (floating point) values  will  be  demonstrated.   The  following  commands
  should  be  entered  interactively  at  the  terminal in response to a series of
  explanatory prompts.

  [1mMATRIX_ACCEPT_ROT<CR>[0m
  [1mMATRIX_ACCEPT_REAL<CR>[0m
  [1mLSLA<CR>[0m

  Observe the list showing suitable characteristics eg.  Header:LSLA Data:REAL.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Successful update of the grid interval values and the  conversion  of  the  data
  values may be demonstrated using the module DTIEDIT.

  When the [1mDTIEDIT>[0m prompt is displayed on the terminal, select the converted  and
  patched DTI file by typing [1mFILEIN[0m [1mMATRIX_ACCEPT_REAL<CR>[0m.  Select metre units of
  measurement by typing [1mUNITS[0m [1mMETRES<CR>[0m and then examine the header  of  the  DTI
  file  by typing [1mSHOW[0m [1mFILEIN<CR>[0m.  Note that DTIPATCH has successfully edited the
  east and north grid interval values to 5 metres.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Successful conversion of the data values from word to real format, is  shown  by
  examining the matrix values using the keypad keys.  To display the matrix on the
  screen type [1mCHANGE[0m.  If you now use the keypad keys [1m1[0m [1m2[0m [1m3[0m [1m4[0m [1m6[0m [1m7[0m [1m8[0m [1m9[0m to move  the
  cursor  around  the  matrix,  you  will  see  that the matrix points are held as
  floating point values.

  To exit from DTIEDIT type [1mCtrl/Z[0m (hold down the Ctrl key and type Z),  and  then
  in response to the [1mDTIEDIT>[0m prompt type [1mEXIT<CR>[0m.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Acceptance of the module DTIVIEW is performed next.  Firstly, the acceptance DTM
  will  be  viewed  as  an  isometric  model using the default viewing parameters.
  Subsequently, quarter screen mode will be used in order to generate 4  isometric
  views using different viewing parameters:  quadrant 1 will show a view generated
  using the defaults; quadrant 2 with a x rotation of value of 0; quadrant 3  with
  a  y  rotation  value  of  -50.0 and a x rotation of 45.0, and quadrant 4 with a
  direction of view from the north.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  In addition to changing the viewing parameters, the  acceptance  procedure  will
  also  demonstrate  how  the colour representation of the views may be varied.  A
  isometric view using a ZSTEP interval of 200 metres will be generated, and  then
  a view with a ZLIMITS value of 0 to 500.  In this view, terrain above 500 metres
  will be shown in white.

  The annotation of the display with a height/colour legend, and  with  user  text
  will be shown.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The DTM will be  viewed  as  a  perspective  image  using  the  default  viewing
