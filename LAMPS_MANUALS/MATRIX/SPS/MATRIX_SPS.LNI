  1  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan MATRIX package is the support  package  for  all  Laser-Scan  DTM
  generation  and  manipulation  software, and other Laser-Scan software using the
  DTI matrix file format.

  There are 4 Laser-Scan DTM production and manipulation packages:

        o  DTMPREPARE -  prepares  IFF  format  vector  data  for  subsequent  DTM
           construction using package DTMCREATE,

        o  DTMCREATE - the DTM creation package,

        o  TVES - [1mT[0merrain [1mV[0misualisation and [1mE[0mxploitation [1mS[0moftware,

        o  DTMCONVERT - conversion of DTM data between  DTI  format  and  external
           formats.


  Package MATRIX contains:

        o  Laser-Scan DTI ([1mD[0migital [1mT[0merrain [1mI[0mmage) format DTM utility programs, for
           DTM manipulation, joining and edit,

        o  a basic DTM viewing program, and,

        o  a DTI file  interface  subroutine  library  (DTILIB)  for  applications
           programmers.

  2  [1mHARDWARE[0m [1mPREREQUISITES[0m


  The following computer hardware requirements are needed to run MATRIX.

        o  Any DEC VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation computer supported by  the  current
           version of VAX/VMS.

        o  At least 10MB of available disc space for software, plus sufficient for
           data files.

        o  At least a 4096 page working set per process, and a virtual page  count
           of  30000  pages  is  needed  for  efficient  operation  of  the larger
           utilities.


  MATRIX Software Product Specification


        o  Any DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal.

        o  Any LSL-supported graphics device, currently one of:

            -  Sigmex 6000 series colour display.

            -  Sigmex ARGS 7000 series colour display.

            -  Tektronix 4010 or 4014 DVST with  enhanced  graphics  and  optional
               Laser-Scan   TMU   controller   (provides   only   vector  graphics
               capability).

            -  A DEC VAX workstation running UIS or the DECwindows/Motif windowing
               systems.


        o  Any DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal (optional if  graphics  device
           has alphanumeric terminal capabilites).

        o  Optionally, a Laser-Scan supported  digitising  table  with  16  button
           cursor, for use with DTIVIEW matrix viewing utility for source document
           registration and command menu input.




  3  [1mSOFTWARE[0m [1mPREREQUISITES[0m

  MATRIX modules run under VAX VMS  Version  5.4-3  (or  later  version,  assuming
  continued   upwards   compatibility   by  DEC).   MATRIX  co-exists  with  other
  interactive and batch processes.

  For the use of Motif on a VAXstation, the  "DECwindows  Motif"  layered  product
  from  DEC  is  required.   The  "VMS DECwindows Developers Kit for Motif" is not
  adequate.

  For the use of UIS on a VAXstation, VAX VMS Workstation Software  (VWS)  version
  4.3 or later is required.

  A minimum working set of 4000 pages is recommended.  Larger  working  sets  will
  help performance, particularly with large matrix files.

  Laser-Scan's [1mI[0mFF [1mM[0map [1mP[0mrocessing package (IMP) is a  prerequisite.   Laser-Scan's
  LITES2 interactive digitising and editing software is recommended for digitising
  and editing vector input data.  LASERTRAK automated  digitising  is  recommended
  for large numbers of input documents.



  4  [1mGROWTH[0m [1mCONSIDERATIONS[0m

  The minimum hardware and software requirements for any future  version  of  this
  product  may be different from the minimum hardware requirements for the current
  version.



  MATRIX Software Product Specification


  5  [1mSUPPORT[0m [1mLEVEL[0m

  MATRIX is a fully supported Laser-Scan standard software product.

                                        NOTE


          There is a facility (DTIPATCH) within the MATRIX package to edit
          the  header  of a DTI file to signal to any subsequent processes
          that the data within the file  is  not  at  the  standard  start
          corner  and direction (SW and clockwise), particularly important
          for the correct display of the DTI file in LITES2.

          Support for rotated DTI files is limited  to  DTILIB,  DTIPATCH,
          DTIROTATE and LITES2.  It is provided for the purpose of initial
          examination and registration of  raw  data.   Such  non-standard
          data   should   be   rotated   using  DTIROTATE  before  further
          processing.

          It is  not  recommended  that  any  data  transformation  MATRIX
          utilities  (except  for  DTIROTATE)  be  used  on  any  of these
          non-standard DTI files as unexpected results  will  probably  be
          encountered.  DTIPATCH and DTITRANS/DESCRIPTOR may still be used
          safely to change any header parameters.



          BIT datatype DTI files are only supported by a  limited  set  of
          programs (DTICONVERT, DTITRANS/DESCRIPTOR, DTIPATCH and LITES2),
          and only for storage and display.

          For any sort of  processing  of  BIT  datatype  files,  such  as
          transformation  or  combination, the data should be converted to
          BYTE datatype using DTICONVERT.  This  restriction  arises  from
          the  fact  that  a  byte  is  the  smallest data unit capable of
          independent manipulation by the VAX computer architecture.





  6  [1mCOMPONENT[0m [1mLIBRARY[0m

  The MATRIX package contains DTILIB which provides a library of  functions  which
  enable  an  applications  program  to  access  DTI  files, and perform basic I/O
  operations on both the header and data areas.  The following groups of  routines
  are provided within the library:


       1.  File Manipulation   - eg.  DTI file creation

       2.  DTI Utility         - eg.  print header details

       3.  Header Read         - eg.  read word from header


  MATRIX Software Product Specification


       4.  Header Write        - eg.  write word to header

       5.  Data Read           - eg.  read word from data area

       6.  Date Write          - eg.  write word to data area

       7.  Header Copy         - eg.  copy array of byte values to header

       8.  Data Copy           - eg.  copy array of word values to the data area

       9.  Data Initialisation - eg.  set all data values to 0



  The library allows up to 9 DTI files to be opened simultaneously.


  It should be noted that the DTILIB functions utilise the memory mapping routines
  (eg.   VIO$OPEN_SEC)  within  the  Laser-Scan  library  LSLLIB, along with other
  LSLLIB I/O  functions.   An  applications  program  that  utilises  DTILIB  must
  therefore  be linked with LSLLIB.  A shared image of LSLLIB routines is provided
  as part of the Laser-Scan kernel LSLSYSTEM package.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIVIEW[0m

  The module DTIVIEW allows elevation data held in a grid DTM to be  viewed  as  a
  3-dimensional  image.  The module has facilities to generate a 3-D terrain image
  using either a parallel (isometric)  or  perspective  projection.   The  terrain
  image  may  be  output to a range of vector graphic devices, or to an IFF vector
  file.

  The main features of DTIVIEW are:

        o  Use of the whole or part of a digital terrain matrix

        o  DTM sub-sampling

        o  Registration of the DTM to a source document positioned on a digitising
           table

           photo-plotting device

        o  Command menu input


  The facility to overlay  data  describing  surface  features  (eg.   rivers  and
  woodland)   upon  a  3-D  terrain  image  is  available  with  the  TVES  module
  DTIVIEWEXTRA.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIEDIT[0m

  The module DTIEDIT enables the interactive display and editing of  a  Laser-Scan
  Digital Terrain Image (DTI) file, using a VT100 compatible display.  In addition
  a number of non-interactive editing commands are  provided,  and  an  option  to
  output the matrix display to a line printer or file.

  The program will  handle  all  types  of  digital  terrain  image  headers,  and
  currently supported data formats (ie.  byte, word, longword, real and bit).

  The matrix is displayed as an image of up to 26 classes, with  each  class  (ie.
  band  of values) being represented by an alphabetic character (lowest A, highest
  Z).  The class interval, range of values displayed, and the area of  the  matrix
  displayed and available for editing may be set by the user.

  Interaction with the display is via the keypad keys.

  The main features of DTIEDIT are:

        o  Display and editing of all Laser-Scan DTI raster format files

        o  Full interaction with the displayed data including

            -  Use of the keypad keys to move a screen cursor around the matrix

            -  Continually updated  display  of  cursor  position  and  associated
               matrix value

            -  Editing of individual matrix points

            -  Editing of line or rectangular area of matrix points

            -  Scrolling of the display in y


        o  User control over the class interval and display range

        o  Output of the matrix representation to a line-printer

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIBLEND[0m

  DTIBLEND is the MATRIX [1mD[0migital [1mT[0merrain [1mI[0mmage (DTI) file edge blend utility.   It
  takes  as  input two DTI files, usually containing terrain elevation models, and
  edge matches them to avoid value discontinuities at the matrix  adjoining  edge.
  Options  are  provided to hold one matrix unchanged while smoothing the other to
  match it, or to smooth both matrices to a common mean along the edge.  An option
  is  provided  to  read  in  IFF  vector data for use as control to the smoothing
  process.

  The data in all the input DTI files should be at the same  grid  resolution  (no
  grid interpolation is performed).

  Changes of DTI file grid resolution should be performed first using the DTITRANS
  utility.

  DTIBLEND offers the following features:

        o  holds one matrix unchanged while smoothing the other to match it, or

        o  smooths both matrices to a common mean along the edge.

        o  reads in IFF vector data for use as control to the smoothing process.

        o  processes in_situ, i.e. open  both  input  files  for  read  and  write
           access.   This option is useful when edge blending large DTI files when
           the user's virtual address quota is inadequate for  opening  additional
           DTI files for output.

        o  override of default blend border width (3 posts).

        o  reports changes that exceed a user specified threshold value and

        o  outputs editing directives to ROVER guidance files, and

        o  generates a listing file.

        o  is command driven.

        o  on-line help and full user documentation.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTITILE[0m

  DTITILE will either merge up to 8 DTI  ([1mD[0migital  [1mT[0merrain  [1mI[0mmage)  files  into  a
  larger  DTI  output  file, or will extract an area of interest from an input DTI
  file and write this to a separate DTI output file.  In addition DTITILE  may  be
  used to create void areas in a DTI file.

  The data in all the input DTI files should be at the same  grid  resolution  (no
  grid interpolation is performed).

  The output DTI file will be produced at the same grid resolution  as  the  first
  input DTI file

  Changes of DTI file grid resolution should be performed first using the DTITRANS
  utility.

  DTITILE offers the following features:

        o  joins DTM grids generated by the DTMCREATE  package  or  other  systems
           which use DTI files.

        o  creates void areas or areas of constant value in the DTI file.

        o  very efficient amalgamation algorithm.

        o  is command driven.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTICOMBINE[0m

  The module DTICOMBINE allows data values in one or more (up to 8) DTI  files  to
  be  combined  according  to  user  specified  arithmetic operations.  The module
  creates an output DTI file containing the resulting data values.

  Optionally only data values that lie within a user specified rectangular  window
  may be processed.

  DTICOMBINE is used to  perform  overlay  operations  and  determine  differences
  between DTI files.

  DTICOMBINE may use the following operators and functions in the expression:

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIROTATE[0m

  DTIROTATE is a matrix manipulation module to permit reordering of DTI format DTM
  rows and columns to suit customer requirements.

  DTIROTATE offers the following features:

        o  takes a DTI format DTM grid generated by DTMCREATE  or  another  system
           and   reorders   (flips)   its   rows  and  columns  to  suit  customer
           requirements.

        o  changes the 'origin' of the output file to be any of the  four  corners
           of the input DTM if required.

        o  enables the data to be ordered by row or by column with respect to  the
           original model.

        o  creates a DTI format DTM file.

        o  provides "most often required" default settings for all options.

        o  is command driven.

        o  offers command file operation to reduce operator error rate and use  of
           "guidance files" for training, demonstrations, and semi/fully-automated
           operation.

        o  on-line help and full user documentation.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTI2TEXT[0m

  The module DTI2TEXT converts a DTI file into a formatted text file.  The  record
  format  of  the text file may be user defined at run-time.  Integer and floating
  point format output may be specified.

  DTI2TEXT provides a data window facility to enable the user to select  sub-areas
  of the DTI file for text conversion.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTICONVERT[0m

  The module DTICONVERT enables a user to convert between the header and data type
  formats  supported within Laser-Scan's Digital Terrain Image (DTI) raster files.
  This conversion may be carried out to reduce the size of raster images stored on
  disk, or to prepare data for display using TVES modules such as ROVER.

  The module allows conversion:

        o  from MIKE,TED4,UHL1,ALVY and LSLA header formats to UHL1, TED4 and LSLA
           formats

        o  between BYTE, WORD, LONGWORD, REAL and BIT data formats

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIPATCH[0m

  The module DTIPATCH enables the  contents  of  a  DTI  header  to  be  modified.
  Currently DTIPATCH operates only on the record fields that are common to all DTI
  header types (ie.  matrix extent  values,  grid  interval  values,  minimum  and
  maximum range values and data corner and orientation).

  DTIPATCH is an interactive prompt driven program.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTITRANS[0m

  The module DTITRANS performs the following sets of operations on grid data  held
  in a DTI format:

        o  transforms  data  held  in  one  map  projection  system  into  another
           projection system

        o  transforms data held in a  map  projection  system  into  Geographicals
           (latitude   and   longitude),   or  from  Geographicals  (latitude  and
           longitude) to a map projection system

        o  transforms data using affine transformation  parameters  determined  by
           the  IMAGEPROCESS  (was  SATMAP) image orientation module, to create an
           image map

        o  resamples date to new x and y sample intervals  and  coordinate  space,
           using control point files for alignment, without any projection change.

        o  allows a DTI projection record to be created and modified

  The module is applicable to all types of raster data, but is primarily  used  to
  transform satellite or digital terrain data.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIFROMTEXT[0m

  The module DTIFROMTEXT converts a text  file  into  a  DTI  file.   The  program
  supports  a  range  of  text  file  input formats, controlled by the qualifiers,
  including the reading of z height data only, or x,y,z data, and a limited  range
  of customised translations.
