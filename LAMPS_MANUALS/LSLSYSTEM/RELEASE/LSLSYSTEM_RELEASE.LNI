  This document describes  recent  changes  to  the  Laser-Scan  software  package
  LSLSYSTEM.   This package provides run time library support and system utilities
  to create an environment which is assumed by all other Laser-Scan software.

  The programs and libraries of the LSLSYSTEM package are documented  as  part  of
  the  various  application  packages  which use them.  In particular, the user is
  referred  to  the  MAPPING  package  documentation   for   general   environment
  information.   The  main  components of LSLSYSTEM are the LSL run time libraries
  such as LSLLIB.OLB, which is also provided as a shareable image file LSLSHR.EXE.

  This document covers the changes to package LSLSYSTEM since the  previous  LAMPS
  release (V5.1) which went into Alpha test in August 1999.  See the release notes
  for the previous LAMPS release for information about earlier changes.

  See the release notes for the  previous  LAMPS  release  for  information  about
  earlier changes.

  The specified versions of the LSLSYSTEM package libraries and programs  had  the
  following facilities added, implemented or their actions altered.

      (A)  RELEASE NOTES:  - These have been trimmed  back  to  the  last  regular
           issue.

      (B)  LSLGOTHICSHR.EXE     - Version of 1-Mar-2000 (OpenVMS VAX V6.2)
           LSLGOTHICSHR_AXP.EXE - Version of 1-Mar-2000 (OpenVMS Alpha V6.2)

          (a)  SPR 4675.   New  LSLGOTHICSHR  with  most  recent  version  of  the
               geometry  handling  library,  geomlib (v1-66).  It includes various
               fixes and enhancements, in particular to operations  involving  the
               combination of geometries.

               NOTE:  The VAX version of this library was  built  on  OpenVMS  VAX
               V6.2.   It  hence cannot be used under earlier versions of VMS such
               as V6.1 or V5.5-2.  It is supported on OpenVMS VAX V6.2  and  V7.1.
               The  Alpha version is built on OpenVMS Alpha V6.2, and is supported
               on V6.2 and V7.1.

      (C)  DPSDUMMYSHR.EXE    - Version of 17-Oct-2002
           DPSDUMMYSHR_TV.EXE - Version of 17-Oct-2002

          (a)  Dummy client libraries for Display PostScript  (DPS).   Adobe,  who
               produced Display PostScript have now ceased support, and instructed
               distributors such as Compaq  to  remove  it  from  their  operating
               systems.   Hence  the  version  of  DECWindows  (Motif V1.2-6) that
               accompanied OpenVMS VAX V7.3 removed the client libraries for  DPS.
               Unfortunately it did not provide stub libraries as replacements, so
               all the programs like LITES2 which  had  been  linked  against  DPS
               failed to start.

               This dummy library can be used as a replacement  for  the  original
               Compaq  DPS  libraries - see next item for command procedure to set
               up appropriate logical names.

      (D)  DPSDUMDEF.COM - Version of 17-Oct-2002

          (a)  Command procedure to set up logical names  for  Display  PostScript
               under  Motif  1.2-6  to  point  to  a  dummy  client library.  (see
               previous item for explanation).  The three  logical  names  set  up
               are:   XDPS$DPSBINDINGSSHR,  XDPS$DPSCLIENTSHR, and XDPS$DPSLIBSHR,
               together with their _TV equivalents for Alpha.

               The supplied procedure defines the logical names  system-wide,  and
               it  should  be  invoked  from  the  system-wide initialisation file
               LSL$STARTUP:LSDEFNS.COM, using @LSL$COM:DPSDUMDEF.COM.  If you want
               to  use  the  procedure  instead in a per-process context, then the
               qualifier /SYSTEM should be removed each line,  and  the  procedure
               executed at login time.
