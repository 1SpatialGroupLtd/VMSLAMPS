  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  The Laser-Scan system support software package  (LSLSYSTEM)  is  assumed  to  be
  present  by  all LSL software components.  It includes environment setup command
  files, run time library support, supplementary  system  utilities,  and  utility
  programs   needed  by  more  than  one  package.   It  provides  the  underlying
  environment to the applications packages that make up the  Laser-Scan  Automated
  Map  Production System (LAMPS), and the XGIS layered GIS products of Horizon and
  Metropolis.

  The programs and libraries of the LSLSYSTEM package are documented  as  part  of
  the  various  application  packages  which use them.  In particular, the user is
  referred  to  the  MAPPING  package  documentation   for   general   environment
  information, notably the "LAMPS Environment Guide".



  2  [3m[1mFACILITIES[0m

  The following facilities are included in the LSLSYSTEM package software.

       1.  The main component of LSLSYSTEM is the LSL run time library LSLLIB.OLB,
           which  is  also  provided  as  a shareable image file LSLSHR.EXE.  This
           library is not for direct customer use, but it is referenced  by  other
           standard LSL libraries, eg LSLFRTLIB, and is accessed as a shared image
           by most LAMPS applications.  Use of the LSLSHR shared image results  in
           smaller  image  size  for LAMPS programs, better sharing of memory, and
           ease of installing modifications and upgrades to LAMPS software.

       2.  Automated   software   installation   procedure   LAMPSINSTALL   allows
           installation  of  LAMPS  software  on  new  customer computers, using a
           customer-specific issue tape generated at Laser-Scan.  Note  that  this
           procedure is intended for use by a LSL software engineer.  LAMPS is not
           customer-installable.  Included in the LSLSYSTEM package  are  template
           command files for LSL environment setup, both as a layered product, and
           as a turnkey system.

       3.  Automated  software  upgrade  procedure  LSLUPDATE  allows  upgrade  by
           customer  of  existing  LAMPS  and  XGIS  software packages on existing
           systems.

       4.  Various support utilities are included in LSLSYSTEM as they are  needed
           by  more  than one LAMPS application package.  These include the SD and
           SI set  default  directory  utilities,  and  the  MLOAD  microprocessor
           loader.

       5.  Various unsupported utilities  such  as  those  for  number  conversion
           (CALC,  CVT,  ERROR) and system inquiry (QUO) are provided as they have
           been found to be generally useful.  Note that these  are  not  part  of
           supported LAMPS software, but are supplied "as is".

       6.  Various file management  utility  command  procedures  (FREE,  MV,  NV,
           PROTECT,  REPEAT,  OPER)  are  provided  as  they have been found to be
           generally useful.  These include template command files for  a  turnkey
           operator function for system backups etc.  Note that these are not part
           of supported LAMPS software, but are supplied "as is" as examples.

       7.  A help library UTILITIES.HLB is provided as outline  documentation  for
           some of the above utilities.

       8.  A package-specific initialisation file LSLSYSTEMINI.COM is provided  to
           set up symbols for the above utilities.  See this file for an annotated
           list of programs and command procedures.
