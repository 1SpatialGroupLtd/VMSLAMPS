  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure  for  the  Laser-Scan  IMP
  (IFF  Map  Processing  package)  which is part of the Laser-Scan LAMPS automated
  mapping system.  It assumes that the user is familiar with digital  cartography,
  with  the  IMP modules, with LAMPS, with the LITES2 map editor, and with the VMS
  operating system.  See the "IMP User Guide", and the "IMP Reference Manual"  for
  further information on IMP.

  The relevant data files and command files for the acceptance tests are listed in
  Appendix A and are supplied by Laser-Scan on installation of the package.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserve the right  to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.

  2  [1mIMP[0m [1mInitialisation[0m

  2.1  [1mEnvironment[0m

  Check  that  the  Laser-Scan-supplied  package   initialisation   command   file
  LSL$COM:IMPINI.COM  has been invoked.  This has probably been done automatically
  on your behalf at login time.  A good check is to use the DCL command:

          $ SHOW SYMBOL IMERGE

  to verify that the DCL symbol IMERGE exists and points to the program image file
  of the IMP module "LSL$EXE:IMERGE".  If symbol IMERGE is not defined then invoke
  the package initialisation command file by giving the DCL command:

          $ @LSL$COM:IMPINI Q

  then repeat the check for the existence of DCL symbol IMERGE.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Repeat the invocation of the initialisation command file, this time without  the
  Q (quiet) modifier by giving the DCL command:

          $ @LSL$COM:IMPINI

  and note the list of the available modules.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  Ensure that logical name LSL$IF:  points to the directory containing  a  working
  copy  of  the  acceptance  test  IFF  file  'filename'.IFF.  (For a list of file
  specifications supplied see appendix A).  This will usually involve copying  the
  standard test file to a working directory with a command such as:

          $ COPY LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[IMP.ACCEPT]IMPTEST.IFF LSL$IF:/LOG



  2.2  [1mInvoking[0m [1mThe[0m [1mPackage[0m

  Invoke  the  acceptance  test  command  procedure  by  giving  the  DCL  command
  "@LSL$COM:IMP_ACCEPT".

  Give the customer name when prompted for it and the acceptance  test  IFF  file.
  (For file specifications see appendix A).  Any error in the file-spec will cause
  a warning message to be produced and a re-prompt for the file-spec.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  3.1  [1mIRENUMBER[0m

  The first module to be used is IRENUMBER to create unique Feature Serial Numbers
  in the output file.  Note the command line given is:

  [1m$ IRENUMBER/LOG[0m [1mfilename.IFF[0m [1mfilename.REN <CR>[0m

  The /LOG qualifier specified to send supplementary  messages  to  the  terminal.
  The defaults for the renumbering BASE, INCREMENT and UPPER_LIMIT and LOWER_LIMIT
  are taken.  The input file is filename.IFF and the output file filename.REN.

  Note the messages showing successful opening of the input and output files,  the
  renumbering  parameters  being  used,  and  a  note  of  each  layer  as  it  is
  encountered.  A message is also output as each  FSN  is  renumbered  and  totals
  information  when  the  end  of  file  is  detected.  Note the timing statistics
  produced  at   program   termination   and   that   $STATUS   is   returned   as
  "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL, normal successful completion".

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.2  [1mICHECK[0m

  ICHECK is used to check for digitised loops  and  for  correspondence  with  the
  IMPTEST FRT (Feature Representation Table) file.

  [1m$ ICHECK/LOG/FRT[0m [1m=[0m [1mIMPTEST[0m [1mfilename.REN <CR>[0m


  The /FRT qualifier is specified to check the  characteristics  of  each  feature
  within  the file against its graphical type in the IMPTEST FRT file (expanded to
  LSL$FRT:IMPTEST.FRT).  The /CROSS (to check for crossing segments)  and  /OUTPUT
  (to  send  messages  to  SYS$OUTPUT) qualifiers are taken by default.  The input
  file is the renumbered file filename.REN.

  Note the messages confirming the input file.  A message is output as each  layer
  is  encountered.   Error totals information is displayed when the end of file is
  detected.  Note the timing statistics produced at program termination  and  that
  $STATUS is returned as "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL, normal successful completion".

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.3  [1mITOTEXT[0m

  ITOTEXT is the IMP module to create a text file from an  IFF  file.   The  input
  file  is  the  renumbered  IFF  file  produced  by IRENUMBER and the output file
  filename.TXT.  The /LOG qualifier sends supplementary messages to the  terminal.
  The command line given is:


  [1mIMP[0m [1mAcceptance[0m [1mtests[0m                                                      Page 6



  [1m$ ITOTEXT/LOG[0m [1mfilename.REN[0m [1mfilename.TXT<CR>[0m


  Note the messages showing successful opening of the input IFF  file  and  output
  text  file  and each layer as it is encountered.  Timing statistics are produced
  at program termination and $STATUS  is  returned  as  "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL,  normal
  successful completion".

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.4  [1mEditing[0m [1mThe[0m [1mText[0m [1mFile[0m [1mUsing[0m [1mEDT[0m

  It is now possible to edit the TEXT  file  (filename.TXT)  using  the  VMS  text
  editor  EDIT.   The  command procedure puts the user into the VMS EDITOR.  If an
  asterisk prompt appears then give the command '[1mC[0m' (for CHANGE)  to  go  to  full
  screen  display  mode.   The  user can now change any of the IFF entries.  It is
  recommended that the user change a few feature codes (the first integer after an
  FS  entry),  some text entries and some ACs.  Note that alteration of NF numbers
  (the FSN) may destroy the unique sequence of FSN's created by IRENUMBER.

  Give the command "<CTRL/Z>" (pressing the CTRL and Z  keys  together)  and  type
  "EXIT" to exit from EDT.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.5  [1mIFROMTEXT[0m

  IFROMTEXT is used to create an IFF file from a text file.  The input  text  file
  is  new  version  of filename.TXT created on exit from EDIT.  The output file is
  filename.NEW.  The /LOG qualifier  is  again  specified  to  send  supplementary
  messages to the terminal.  The command line is:

  [1m$ IFROMTEXT/LOG[0m [1mfilename.TXT[0m [1mfilename.NEW<CR>[0m


  Note the messages showing successful opening of the input text file  and  output
  IFF  file  and  each  layer as it is written.  Timing statistics are produced at
  program  termination  and  $STATUS  is  returned  as  "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL,  normal
  successful completion".

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.6  [1mIPATCH[0m

  IPATCH is used to check the validity of IFF  files  and  to  examine  individual
  entries in them.  The command line specified is:

  [1m$ IPATCH[0m [1mfilename.NEW<CR>[0m



  [1mIMP[0m [1mAcceptance[0m [1mtests[0m                                                      Page 7


  with the input file being filename.NEW (created by IFROMTEXT).  If  on  a  VT100
  type  terminal,  note the STATUS block at the top of the terminal confirming the
  name of the input file.  Use the IPATCH commands "NEXT" to step forward  through
  the file, "PREVIOUS" to step backwards, "EXPLAIN" to examine an entry and "TYPE"
  to type an entry.  Type "HELP" to get help on IPATCH and  "HELP  subcommand"  to
  get  help  on  IPATCH commands and IFF entries.  Type "STATUS OFF" to switch off
  the status block and "STATUS ON" to switch it back on.  Type "*" to  rewind  the
  file then type "PREV" and note the error message produced.  (For full details of
  IPATCH commands see the IMP User Guide and the IMP Reference Manual).

  Give the command "<CTRL/Z>" (pressing the CTRL and  Z  keys  together)  or  type
  "EXIT" to exit from IPATCH.  Note that $STATUS is returned as "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL,
  normal successful completion".  If user has specified an  invalid  command  then
  $STATUS will return as "%SYSTEM-E-ABORT, abort".  Either of these codes indicate
  a successful exit.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.7  [1mIDIFFERENCE[0m

  IDIFFERENCE is now used to compare the renumbered IFF file filename.REN and  the
  file created by IFROMTEXT filename.NEW.  The command line given is:

  [1m$ IDIFFERENCE/LOG[0m [1mfilename.REN[0m [1mfilename.NEW<CR>[0m


  with the  /LOG  qualifier  specified  to  send  supplementary  messages  to  the
  terminal.

  Note the messages indicating successful opening of the two input files  and  the
  messages  produced as each layer is encountered.  Note how the default tolerance
  used by IDIFFERENCE affects the comparison of real numbers  in  the  RA  and  AC
  entries.   These differences occur in the seventh significant figure and may not
  necessarily appear obvious to the user.  Note that the HI entry is missing  from
  both files.  The changes in the text file during the text editing session should
  be noted by the program, and a summary of  the  differences  between  the  files
  output   at   program   termination.    Note   that   $STATUS   is  returned  as
  "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL, normal successful completion".

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.8  [1mISTART[0m

  ISTART is used to create 'new' type template IFF files.  The file to be  created
  is called filename.SRT and the /LOG and /LEARNER qualifiers are specified on the
  command line to send supplementary messages to the terminal and give  additional
  explanation  about  the  information  required  by  the  program.   The  /SYMBOL
  qualifier causes corner symbols to be output to  the  file  rather  than  corner
  ticks.


  [1mIMP[0m [1mAcceptance[0m [1mtests[0m                                                      Page 8


  The command line given is:

  [1m$ ISTART/LOG/LEARNER/SYMBOL[0m [1mfilename.SRT<CR>[0m


  The user is told that the output file opened successfully.   The  user  is  then
  given  a  brief description of ISTART and is asked whether he wants to continue.
  Type "YES".  Then the user is prompted  for  the  map  scale.   Type  "2500"  to
  represent a 1:2500 scale map.

  The next prompt is:

  Specify coordinates for the top left control point (X then Y) :

  Type "0 1000" to represent a control point of 0 in X and 1000 in Y.  Type "0  0"
  when  prompted for the bottom left control point.  Type "1000" when prompted for
  the bottom right control point and note the prompt for the Y ordinate.  Type "0"
  in  response  to  this.   Type  <RETURN> when prompted for the top right control
  point and note the re-prompt for the coordinates.  Type "1000 1000" in  response
  to this.

  Note the message verifying the control point values before program  termination,
  and   that   $STATUS   is   returned  as  "%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL,  normal  successful
  completion".

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m



  3.9  [1mIMERGE[0m

  IMERGE is used to merge the 'new' type  IFF  file  created  by  ISTART  and  the
  (modified)  original  file  created by IFROMTEXT.  The input files therefore are
  filename.SRT and filename.NEW.  The 'new' type file is specified  first  in  the
  command line to preserve the HIstory entry and type 2 Map Descriptor (MD) in the
  output  file  (filename.MER).   The  /LOG  qualifier  is  again  used  to   send
  supplementary messages to the terminal.

  The command line given is:

  [1m$ IMERGE/LOG[0m [1mfilename.SRT,filename.NEW[0m [1mfilename.MER<CR>[0m


  Note the messages confirming the opening of the input files and the output  file
  and  the  message that the second input file has no HIstory entry.  Messages are
  also  output  as  each  layer  is   encountered.    $STATUS   is   returned   as
