  1  [1mINTRODUCTION[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan Package
  DTMPREPARE  which  is part of the Laser-Scan LAMPS automated mapping system.  It
  assumes that the user is familiar with the LITES2 map editor, and with  the  VMS
  operating system.  See the "DTMPREPARE Reference Manual" for further information
  on DTMPREPARE.

  The relevant data files and command files for the acceptance tests are  supplied
  by Laser-Scan on installation of the package.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserves the right to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.

  DTMPREPARE is a package of routines which prepares vector data for  use  by  the
  DTM generation utilities.

  Check  that  the  Laser-Scan-supplied  package   initialisation   command   file
  LSL$COM:DTMPREPAREINI.COM  has  been  invoked.   This  has  probably  been  done
  automatically on your behalf at login time.  A good check  is  to  use  the  DCL
  command:

          $ SHOW SYMBOL I3D

  to verify that the DCL symbol I3D exists and points to the  program  image  file
  "LSL$EXE:I3D.EXE".   If  symbol  I3D  is  not  defined  then  invoke the package
  initialisation command file by giving the DCL command:

          $ @LSL$COM:DTMPREPAREINI

  then repeat the check for the existence of DCL symbol I3D.

  Use the DCL SHOW LOGICAL command to ensure that logical name LSL$IF points to  a
  suitable  working  directory  to receive the acceptance test IFF files.  If not,
  then use the SI utility to set LSL$IF appropriately.

  The acceptance test command procedure  will  check  for  the  existence  of  the
  required  acceptance  test data files in their usual directory on the Laser-Scan
  software  distribution  directory  tree.   It  will  set  up  a   logical   name
  LSL$DTMPREPARE_ACCEPT to point to this directory.

  Invoke the acceptance test command procedure by giving the DCL command

          $ @LSL$COM:DTMPREPARE_ACCEPT

  The acceptance tests for DTMPREPARE are in two parts.  The first is  for  module
  ITCHECK,  the  terrain checker, the second is for I3D, the river/ridge heighting
  utility.


  [1mDTMPREPARE[0m [1mAcceptance[0m [1mtests[0m                                               Page 3


  The acceptance command procedure then explains briefly the various phases of the
  ITCHECK  acceptance  procedure.   Before  starting processing, it offers you the
  option of using the LITES2 map editor to inspect the initial data.  It then runs
  the ITCHECK utility six times to carry out the various classes of error checking
  provided with the vector checking module.  After each ITCHECK run the  tabulated
  error  file  and  LITES2  command file can be optionally printed.  After all the
  ITCHECK runs are complete it offers you the  option  of  using  the  LITES2  map
  editor to inspect the errors detected in each run.

  The second part of the acceptance gives you the option of using the  LITES2  map
  editor  to  inspect  the  initial unheighted river/ridgeline data.  A first pass
  through I3D is then run with processing mode "INTERSECT".  After this first pass
  you  are  given  the  option  of examining the river/ridgeline data which is now
  heighted at each terrain intersection.  A second pass through I3D  is  then  run
  with  processing  mode  "FLOW".   This  will  detect  a  number  of nodes in the
  river/ridgeline network for which a height is required which cannot be estimated
  automatically.  A height must be edited into the partially heighted data at each
  node indicated, using LITES2 together with the LITES2 command file  produced  by
  I3D.   The  output from such an interactive heighting session, which is required
  by the third pass through I3D, has been saved.  I3D is then run  in  INTERPOLATE
  mode,  but  before this you are given the option of using LITES2 to perform this
  height editing yourself.  Finally the acceptance command  procedure  offers  you
  the  option  of  using  the  LITES2  map  editor  to  examine the height control
  generated for the river and ridgeline features.

  For the purpose of acceptance, a data file containing contour  and  spot  height
  data will be supplied.  A number of errors in the height coding of the data, and
  in the geometry of the data have been introduced into the file.  The errors  are
  of  the  kind  which  may  commonly  occur  during the data capture process (eg.
  crossing contour lines, incorrect heighting of a spot height and missing contour
  in a sequence of contours).

  The acceptance procedure first runs ITCHECK six times with the  detected  errors
  being  stored  in  tabulated error file and a LITES2 command file.  Between runs
  the option to print out these files is offered.  The six sets of tests  will  be
  carried out in the following sequence.

  [1mCHECK 1[0m tests that:

       1.  All supplementary contour heights are divisible  by  the  supplementary
           contour interval.

       2.  All contour heights are divisible by the contour interval.

       3.  All index contour heights are divisible by the index contour interval.

       4.  All contour heights lie within a specified height range.

       5.  All index contour heights lie within a specified height range.

       6.  Coastline items have zero height.

  [1mCHECK 2[0m tests that:

       1.  No items cross or lie outside the rectangular map border as defined  by
           the corner point (CP) entry.

       2.  Correct contour, lake and island closure if loop lines.

       3.  Unconnected contour line items.

       4.  Linking contour lines with height mismatch.

       5.  Contour lines linking to more than two other feature.


  [1mCHECK 3[0m tests:

       1.  For touching or crossing contour lines.

       2.  For river lines crossing contour lines more than once.


  [1mCHECK 4[0m tests:

       1.  The validity of the heights of neighbouring features.   (This  involves
           carrying out profiles across the map at a fixed eastings interval).


  [1mCHECK 5[0m tests:

       1.  Start and end vectors of contour loops do not cross.

       2.  Contour lines do not contain internal loops.

       3.  Contour lines do not contain duplicate points.

       4.  Spot heights are defined by a single coordinate.


  [1mCHECK 6[0m tests:

       1.  Spot height and neighbouring contour height values are valid.


  The acceptance procedure will supply appropriate contour interval and  tolerance
  values for each set of checks.  The tabulated error files will be created on the
  current directory and will have the following filename specification:-

          DTMPREPARE_ACCEPTn.LIS          (where n is check number eg 1 - 6)

  The LITES2 command files will be created on the directory defined by the logical
  LSL$LITES2CMD and will have the following filename specification:-

          DTMPREPARE_ACCEPTn.LCM          (where n is check number eg 1 - 6)

  After all the ITCHECK runs have been completed  you  are  given  the  option  to
  inspect  the  errors  detected  for  each  of  ITCHECK  runs  using LITES2.  The
  acceptance command procedure will  automatically  run  LITES2  with  the  LITES2

  command files generated from within the ITCHECK run.

  At each error the LITES2 command file will position the cursor on the feature in
  error  with  message  to  the  text  screen or window.  At this point control is
  passed to you.  After examination of detected error you may continue the  LITES2
  command file by issuing the CONTINUE command.

  The following sequence of LITES2 sessions are used in the acceptance of  ITCHECK
  module.

          1. CHECK 1 - contours in range, divisible by contour int. etc. 

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

          2. CHECK 2 - items within boundary, etc.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

          3. CHECK 3 - touching or crossing features.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

          4. CHECK 4 - validity of heights of neighbouring items.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

          5. CHECK 5 - loops, duplicate points etc.

          6. CHECK 6 - spot heights and neighbouring contour heights.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  For the purpose of acceptance two files containing river and ridgeline data  and
  one  file  containing  terrain data will be supplied.  The first river/ridgeline
  file does not contain any height data.  This file will be used in the first pass
  through  I3D  with mode INTERSECT enabled.  The second river/ridgeline file will
  contain data heighted at the nodes which will be identified by  I3D  during  the
  second  pass  through  I3D with FLOW mode enabled, as requiring heighting by the
  user.  This file will be used in the third and final pass through I3D with  mode
  INTERPOLATE enabled.

  Note:  the second river/ridgeline  file  would  normally  be  created  after  an
  interactive  session using LITES2 map editor to height the nodes indicated.  The
  heighting of all these  nodes  during  the  acceptance  test  would  be  a  time
  consuming  task  since  considerable  care  must  be taken to supply node height
  values which will enable I3D to determine the correct river flow.

  You will be asked if you want to examine the original IFF file in LITES2.

  [1mCHECK 1[0m tests that:

        o  LITES2 can be optionally invoked to examine the  first  river/ridgeline
           input  data  to  the  acceptance  test.   Note that the river and ridge
           features have no height attribute (use EXAMINE  ATTRIBUTE  on  selected
           river  or ridgeline features).  Also confirm that all the contours have
           a height attribute (type VERIFY AC).  To proceed  to  the  next  check,
           exit from LITES2 by entering [1mQUIT[0m.


                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  [1mCHECK 2[0m tests that:

        o  The first pass through I3D will be invoked with enable  mode  INTERSECT
           selected.   A  touch tolerance is declared which determines when rivers
           or ridgelines which almost touch terrain features will be considered as
           actually  touching.   This creates a new output IFF file.  In this test
           rivers (FC 2) and ridges (FC 9) are of particular interest.   Expect  a
           'normal successful completion' message.


                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  [1mCHECK 3[0m tests that:

        o  LITES2 can now be optionally invoked to check that nodes on rivers  and
           ridges  intersecting with contours are heighted ( use EXAMINE ATTRIBUTE
           on selected river or ridgeline features).  Enter [1mQUIT[0m to  proceed  with
           next check.


                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  [1mCHECK 4[0m tests that:

        o  The second pass through I3D will  be  invoked  with  enable  mode  FLOW
           selected.   A  maximum  height  interval and clip tolerance is declared
           which determines the output IFF file.  This run finds a number of nodes
           in  the river and ridgeline network which require interactive heighting
           ; storing them in a LITES2 command file -  error  messages  identifying
           the  'number  of  unheighted  free ends' and 'undirected river terminal
           links' are displayed.  The LITES2 command file created will  visit  all
           nodes  for  which  a required height cannot be estimated automatically.
           Also expect a warning stating 'data error was detected' and  a  'normal
           successful  completion'  message.  A checkplot IFF file containing flow
           symbols will also be created.


                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  [1mCHECK 5[0m tests:

        o  After the second I3D run you will be given the option to use LITES2  to
           height a few of these nodes, using the LITES2 command file generated by
           I3D.  The checkplot IFF file is displayed - arrow  and  box  symbols  -
           showing a provisional direction of flow.  On entering LITES2 the cursor

           immediately visits an unheighted node and the operator should  zoom  in
           to obtain a satisfactory display.  On entering [1mCONTINUE[0m the operator is
           prompted for a height value for the node in question  -  every  contour
           has  a height label to help in this process.  The command file proceeds
           to the second unheighted node  -  maintaining  the  zoom  factor  -  to
           continue  with  the  interactive  process.  To abort the LITES2 command

           A  file already exists with the correct node heights which will be used
           in the subsequent checks.

  [1mCHECK 6[0m tests that:

        o  The third pass through I3D will be invoked with enable mode INTERPOLATE
           selected.   Diagnostics  will  be  enabled to show progress through the
           various stages of the heighting procedure.  The  run  will  generate  a
           river/ridgeline  IFF  file with 3D strings containing heighted data.  A
           new checkplot IFF file containing flow symbols will also be created  to
           indicate   the   final  flow  determined.   Expect  a  warning  message
           confirming that 'flow determined in river network is  not  unique'  and
           'normal successful completion' message.

  [1mCHECK 7[0m tests:

        o  After the third I3D run you will be given the option to use  LITES2  to
           examine  the results of the heighting process.  The checkplot file will
           be overlayed to give a graphical representation of  the  derived  flow.
           Note that all river features with FC = 2 and ridgeline features with FC
           = 9 will be heighted at every  point  (use  LITES2  commands  NEXT  and
           EXAMINE  ATTRIBUTE).   Other  river  or  ridgeline  features  having  a
           different FC will not be heighted since they were not  defined  in  the
           group  definition table that was loaded using the LOOKUP command in the
           I3D run.  To exit out of LITES2 enter [1mQUIT[0m.
