  DTMPREPARE Software Product Specification


  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  DTMPREPARE is an advanced data preparation package for vector data which  is  to
  be  used  for  DTM  generation.   It  is recommended for use with the Laser-Scan
  "DTMCREATE" DTM creation package.

  The DTMPREPARE package is one of 3 Laser-Scan DTM  production  and  manipulation
  packages:

        o  DTMPREPARE - prepares IFF format vector data for DTM construction using
           package DTMCREATE

        o  DTMCREATE - the DTM creation package

        o  TVES - [1mT[0merrain [1mV[0misualisation and [1mE[0mxploitation [1mS[0moftware


  All three packages are supplied with a  background  package  "MATRIX".   Package
  MATRIX  contains  Laser-Scan  DTI  ([1mD[0migital [1mT[0merrain [1mI[0mmage) format DTM management
  programs, a basic DTM viewing program and a DTI manipulation subroutine  library
  for applications programmers.  (See separate SPS for MATRIX package)

  [1mDTMPREPARE[0m [1m-[0m [1minput/output[0m

  Data input to the DTMPREPARE package is from Laser-Scan  IFF  ([1mI[0mnternal  [1mF[0meature
  [1mF[0mormat)  vector  files.  Input vector data may consist of contour strings and/or
  spot heights, and two dimensional river and ridgeline strings.   Modules  within
  DTMPREPARE  enable the user to select automatic contour data validation options,
  and options to derive three dimensional river and  ridgeline  strings  from  two
  dimensional  input  by  reference  to  relevant contours.  Data output is in IFF
  format.

  [1mFACILITIES[0m

  DTMPREPARE offers the following features:

        o  use of standard DEC VAX

        o  use of junction structured (link-node) data to form network  links  and
           improve processing performance

        o  options to produce LITES2 command files to enable automated  assistance
           in IFF editing

        o  diagnostic printout facility.


  [1mHARDWARE[0m [1mPREREQUISITES[0m

  The following computer hardware requirements are needed to run DTMPREPARE.

  DTMPREPARE Software Product Specification


  [1mMODULE[0m [1mI3D[0m

  The module I3D is a 3D string generator.  Its purpose is  to  generate  heighted
  river  or  ridgeline  3D  strings  by overlaying unheighted strings with contour
  data.

  The 3D strings output by I3D may be input to the Laser-Scan DTMCREATE package as
  rivers,  ridgelines  or  3D  breaklines  to control valley floors, hill tops and
  complex geomorphic areas disturbed by mining or other human activity.

  The module must be used in conjunction with the STRUCTURE package module  ILINK,
  and the LITES2 interactive cartographic editor.

  ILINK is used to ensure that the unheighted river and ridgeline data  has  exact
  junctions  suitable  for link-node structuring within I3D.  In the case of river
  strings, the link-node data structure is used to derive network relationships to
  enable  accurate  heighting  of  river confluences and to ensure consistent down
  hill flow.

  The LITES2 cartographic  editor  is  used  to  generate  supplementary  heighted
  features  for  areas  of  the  map  where the contour information alone provides
  insufficient control.  I3D produces a LITES2 guidance file that will  allow  the
  creation of supplementary features to be automatically driven.

  I3D offers the following features:

        o  produces three  dimensional  strings  from  two  dimensional  river  or
           ridgeline  strings  by  overlaying  with  source  contours  and/or spot
           heights.

        o  accepts Laser-Scan's IFF ([1mI[0mnternal [1mF[0meature [1mF[0mormat) data as  input  from
           disk.

        o  outputs modified data to IFF disk file as 3 dimensional strings.

        o  enables the user to apply IFF layer and feature code selection criteria
           to  the  incoming  strings  to  identify  each as a river, ridgeline or
           contour feature.

        o  creates an internal representation of a river  network  allowing  river
           confluences  to  be  efficiently  identified, and checks for consistent
           down-hill flow of rivers to be performed.

        o  user control over the mode of operation and heighting parameters.

        o  options to output LITES2 command files to enable  automated  assistance
           in IFF editing.

        o  diagnostic printout facility.



  DTMPREPARE Software Product Specification


  [1mMODULE[0m [1mITCHECK[0m

  The module ITCHECK detects and tabulates errors in IFF vector data.  It is  used
  to  validate  a  height  value  associated  with a map feature, and to check for
  errors in the form of a feature.

  Typically, the data input for checking will consist  of  heighted  contours  and
  spot  heights,  and map features such as rivers and ridge lines.  These features
  are used in the generation of a DTM by modules in the package DTMCREATE.

  Errors in height or form may arise from data capture or data editing operations.
  Validating  the  map  data  using ITCHECK is an important aid to controlling the
  quality and accuracy of the output DTM, and in a production situation may  avoid
  expensive  and time-consuming problems resulting from the input into the terrain
  modelling process of incorrectly heighted or malformed data.

  Features found in error are reported in a text file and may be optionally copied
  to  a  separate  IFF  file for subsequent plotting or interrogation.  Optionally
  also  a  LITES2  guidance  file  may  be  produced  to  assist   correction   or
  investigation of the features that have been detected in error.

  The checks performed by ITCHECK are  grouped  into  six  categories.   A  single
  category  or a number of categories of checks, may be selected at run time.  The
  following checks are performed in each category:

  [1mCategory[0m [1m1[0m Height checks

      Supplementary contour heights are divisible  by  the  supplementary  contour
      interval.

      Contour heights are divisible by the contour interval.

      Index contour heights are divisible by the index contour interval.

      All heights lie within a specified range.

      Contour values between lower and upper range limits are present.

      Index contour values between lower and upper range limits are present.

      Coastline features have zero height.

  [1mCategory[0m [1m2[0m Link checks

      Features lie within a rectangular map border as defined by the control point
      (CP) entry or via the BORDER command.

      Loop features are correctly closed.

      Connecting line features have the same height.

      Line features such as contours are connected to two other items.

  [1mCategory[0m [1m3[0m Intersection checks


  DTMPREPARE Software Product Specification


      River features do not cross line features more than once.

      Line features do not cross other line features.

  [1mCategory[0m [1m4[0m Profile height checks

      The heights  of  neighbouring  features  are  consistent  with  the  contour
      interval.

  [1mCategory[0m [1m5[0m Loop, duplicate points and spot height single coordinate checks.

      Spot heights have a valid CB (one coordinate in CB entry).

      Line feature ends do not cross.

      Line features do not contain internal loops.

      Line features do not have duplicate points.

  [1mCategory[0m [1m6[0m Validity of spot heights checks

      Spot heights are consistent with neighbouring contours.

  The user may select which group of features are  input  into  the  checks.   For
  example,  checking  may be restricted to just index contours.  Feature codes are
  used to define which features belong to a given group.

  All parameters controlling the check operations may be defined by  the  user  at
  run time.
