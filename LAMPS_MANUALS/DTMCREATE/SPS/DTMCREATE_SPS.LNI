  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  DTMCREATE is a semi-interactive Digital Terrain Model (DTM) production system.

  The DTMCREATE package is one of 3 Laser-Scan  DTM  production  and  manipulation
  packages:

        o  DTMPREPARE - prepares IFF format vector data for DTM construction using
           package DTMCREATE,

        o  DTMCREATE - the DTM creation package,

        o  TVES - [1mT[0merrain [1mV[0misualisation and [1mE[0mxploitation [1mS[0moftware  -  an  advanced
           DTM manipulation, validation and editing package


  All three packages are supplied with a  background  package  "MATRIX".   Package
  MATRIX  contains  Laser-Scan  DTI  ([1mD[0migital [1mT[0merrain [1mI[0mmage) format DTM management
  programs, a basic DTM viewing program and a DTI manipulation subroutine  library
  for applications programmers.  (See separate SPS for MATRIX package)




  1.1  [3m[1mDTMCREATE[0m [1m-[0m [3m[1mInput.[0m

  Data input to the DTMCREATE package is from  Laser-Scan  IFF  ([1mI[0mnternal  [1mF[0meature
  [1mF[0mormat) files on magnetic disk.  Data may consist of contour strings and/or spot
  heights, clifflines and three dimensional river and  ridgeline  strings.   Whole
  IFF  layers  or  individual  feature  codes may be nominated as indicating slope
  breaklines, clifflines, ridgelines and rivers at run time.

  TRIANG is the spatial structure generation  program  that  defines  source  data
  inter-node  relationships  based  on  a Delaunay triangulation.  It produces two
  binary files which serve as input to other DTMCREATE package programs.

  TRIANG features are:

        o  accepts Laser-Scan's Internal Feature Format (IFF) data as  input  from
           disk.

        o  offers the choice between an  idealised  Delaunay  triangulation  (more
           suited  for  large  scale geological surface estimation) or constrained
           Delaunay triangulation for complex geomorphological applications.

        o  enables the  user  to  select  IFF  layers  and/or  feature  codes  for
           breakline allocation.

        o  enables the  user  to  select  IFF  layers  and/or  feature  codes  for
           cliffline allocation.

        o  has  feature  coding  facility  for  rivers  and  ridgelines,  enabling
           geomorpholical constraints to be applied to automatic interpolations of
           DTM points in river valleys and on hill tops.

        o  enables the user to select specific IFF layers and/or feature codes for
           triangulation from a large multi-layer IFF file.

        o  enables the user to select  input  from  DTI  (Digital  Terrain  Image)
           format DTM files for edge matching purposes.

        o  creates "imaginary points" around the edge of  supplied  data  area  to
           automatically  overcome  "edge  of  the world effects", leading to high
           quality inter-DTM edge matching.

        o  provides "most often required" default settings for all options.

        o  offers change of  measurement  system  on  data  input,  eg  metric  to
           imperial or vice-versa, (or to any user defined system).

        o  enables the user to ignore selected IFF layers and/or feature codes.

        o  enables multi-file input to the same triangulation  run,  enabling  the
           user to change input parameters between files.

        o  offers the user the option of graphical output showing  the  growth  of
           the triangulation.

        o  enables the user to specify a  rectangular  window  defining  the  area
           required  for  triangulation;  input data lying outside of these limits
           will be ignored.

        o  defaults to use of the IFF file range to determine the  extent  of  the
           triangulation.

  TRIDER takes as input the binary files which define the triangulation  structure
  created  by TRIANG (or output by TRIEDIT) and estimates the first derivatives of
  slopes at each node within the triangulation.  Output is to a binary file  which
  is used as input to TRIGRID.

  TRIDER offers the following features:

        o  four options for estimation of Z values for "imaginary points"  outside
           the  area  for  which  source data is available.  This greatly enhances
           edge matching between DTMs.

        o  produces a disk file containing the slope derivatives for each node  in
           the  triangulation.   This  may be rapidly read into the DTM generating
           module (TRIGRID) each time a grid of differing resolution is required.

        o  provides "most often required" default settings for all options.

        o  offers user option of graphical output showing progress  of  derivative
           estimation.

        o  is command driven.

        o  offers command file operation to reduce operator error rate and use  of
           "guidance files" for training, demonstrations, and semi/fully-automated
           operation.

  TRIGRID is a grid (DTM) generation  program  operating  on  the  data  structure
  created by TRIANG or TRIEDIT and TRIDER,

  TRIGRID offers the following features:

        o  production of DTMs with differing cell sidelengths in X and Y.

        o  enables the user to specify repeatedly the extent of the  desired  DTM,
           associated  DTM  size  and  sidelength until the desired combination is
           presented.

        o  offers the choice between linear facet estimation of  DTM  post  values
           (fast  but rather angular DTM surface) or a smooth surface patch option
           which fits local quintic surfaces for DTM post estimation  (slower  but
           very smooth DTM surface).

        o  offers options to restrain the smooth surface patch interpolation, both
           within  individual triangles and over the whole data range, to suit the
           source contour interval and terrain character.

        o  enables the user to  select  automatic  limits  for  the  smooth  patch
           interpolation  based  upon the geomorphological context of the triangle
           and the feature code attributes of the triangle vertices.

        o  outputs the Laser-Scan internal DTI (Digital Terrain Image) format  DTM
           files   which  are  the  common  file  medium  for  the  TVES  (Terrain
           Visualisation and Exploitation Software) package.

        o  offers graphical output showing growth of the DTM grid.

        o  provides "most often required" default settings for all options.

        o  is command driven.

        o  offers command file operation to reduce operator error rate and use  of
           "guidance files" for training, demonstrations, and semi/fully-automated
