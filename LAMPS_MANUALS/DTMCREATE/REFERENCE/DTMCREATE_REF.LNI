            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The first three chapters provide an  overview  of  DTMCREATE  and  are
            intended  as  a  quick  reference guide to the salient features of the
            DTMCREATE package.

            There then follow the User Reference Guides for the individual modules
            which  comprise  DTMCREATE.   Each individual module contains the same
            basic categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the DTMCREATE module.

            REPLACES            - which older Laser-Scan programs it replaces.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the modules does

            FORMAT              - a summary of the module command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            DESCRIPTION         - the definitive description of the module action.

            EXAMPLES            - annotated examples of module useage.

            MESSAGES            - all classes of message are listed and described
                                  and suggested user action given. The messages
                                  are divided into sections according to message
                                  severity within which the messages are ordered
                                  alphabetically by message mnemonic.

            Where  applicable,  additional  categories  are  available  for   some
            modules.  Some modules, for example, have a "RESTRICTIONS" category.

            The Laser-Scan DTM software packages provide tools for the production,
            validation,  manipulation  and viewing of matrix data, particularly of
            elevation (height) data.   The  DTMCREATE  package  consists  of  four
            interlocking  software  modules  for  the  generation of DTM data from
            Laser-Scan IFF (Internal Feature Format) vector data.

            In most cases the output matrix, or DTM, will be derived from contour,
            3D  river,  3D  ridgeline and spot height information.  Other forms of
            input data can be handled.  For instance, 2D seismic line information,
            random  borehole  or  oil  well  data.   Laser-Scan DTMCREATE software
            represents an attempt to provide a single mapping  system  that  copes
            well with all these types.

            It is however optimised and extensively used for  grid  terrain  model
            generation.

            Incoming string data usually consists of digitised x,y data locations,
            each  with  an  associated  z  or  height  value.   An alternative for
            isarithmic data are strings of x,y locations  with  a  single  implied
            surface value.  Single point (spot height) data can also be used.

            Data  entering  the  system  may  contain  information  about  surface
            characteristics other then height, as well as defining the location of
            particular values.  The usual case  is  either  implied  or  specified
            detail concerning the local slope at the data point.  This could be of
            various types:

            1.  smooth continuous variation in slope around a point,

            2.  slope discontinuities at the point (ridge  lines,  river  courses,
                sea lake or embankment edges, non-vertical geological faults), or,

            3.  discontinuities in the thematic variable (cliffs, vertical faults,
                boundaries).


            All three types are still represented by location and  value,  but  in
            addition   every   string   must   also   possess  a  type  identifier
            corresponding to the classes above.

            In addition to data type, individual data points may also  be  flagged
            to represent the following geomorphological attributes:

             o  Point is part of a river

             o  Point is part of a ridgeline

             o  Point has no particular geomorphological significance.

  INTRODUCTION                                                     12 October 1992


            The Laser-Scan DTM creation software uses such data coded with height,
            type and geomorphological flag attributes to produce a TIN (Triangular
            Irregular Network).  An interactive graphical editor  is  provided  to
            enable the user to alter and refine the triangulation.

            The triangulation is then used to generate a rectangular  grid  spaced
            at  some  geographical  interval  over  the area concerned.  It is not
            possible in such a grid - unless it is very fine - to ensure that  the
            data  values  themselves  are  represented  at the grid nodes, but the
            general convenience of using the very simple structure of  direct  row
            storage  makes  grid manipulation and automated comparison of one grid
            with another quite straightforward.

            The blend of triangulation and grid  based  methods  provided  by  the
            Laser-Scan   DTM  software  offers  economy  of  execution  speed  and
            convenience of use.  Once calculated and stored, further  editing  and
            revision  of a triangular digital terrain model (DTM) can occur at any
            time.  It is a simple process to  output  a  grid  DTM  based  on  the
            triangular structure at the resolution required by the user.  The same
            triangular DTM can then  be  used,  without  further  calculation,  to
            generate as many rectangular grids as required from all or part of the
            data area.

            This manual attempts  to  explain  the  philosophy  of  the  DTMCREATE
            triangulation  approach  to  DTM production, together with a module by
            module reference guide to the package.

            The Laser-Scan DTM software  packages  consist  of  discrete  software
            modules  which may be used to form a DTM production flowline.  Salient
            modules are:


            [1mTRIANG[0m [1m-[0m [1mdata[0m [1mstructure[0m [1mgeneration[0m

            Contour strings are assumed to have no connection with each other.  If
            they  do,  and  the  spatial  relationships between them and any other
            points are known, some other data structure creation module  would  be
            more  sensibly  employed.   TRIANG  determines  the Thiessen (Brassel,
            1979) neighbours for each point in the complete data  set.   From  the
            neighbours  surrounding  the  point a system of triangles can be built
            (McCullagh, 1980) which uniquely segment the map area -  the  Delaunay
            (1934)  triangulation  (dual  of  the Thiessen polygon - also known as
            Dirichlet tesselation, Vorodnoi network, etc.)

            The area of coverage for data structuring is specified  by  the  user.
            As  the  triangulation  is unique it is not necessary to map the whole
            area at once, but it is perfectly possible to join areas seamlessly by
            allowing  a  minimum  of  one  triangle  of  overlap.   This is a very
            powerful feature of the system.

            All data are converted to integer on input to enhance execution speed.
            The  basic  system  operates  at  a  resolution of 150000 units in the
            longest map axis direction; equivalent to  a  positional  accuracy  of
            0.015  mm for a map 1 metre long.  Choice of coverage is therefore not
            crucial, but if super high resolution  is  required  the  map  can  be
            divided  into sections and each section structured separately, gridded
            using TRIGRID and then assembled using DTITILE.

            TRIANG supports the following data types:

            1.  breaklines - (X, Y,constant Z) and (X, Y,continuous Z)

            2.  clifflines - (X, Y,constant Z, constant Z) only

            3.  normal strings, eg contours - (X, Y, constant Z)

            4.  spot heights - (X, Y, Z)


            In addition TRIANG supports the following node flags:

            1.  ordinary string/data node

  General                                                          12 October 1992


            2.  river string/data node

            3.  ridge-line string/data node


            The neighbour search procedure does not rely on  contour  integrity  -
            gaps  are  allowed,  as are spot heights and discontinuities of slope.
            Thus one can use partially digitised maps  where  the  digitising  has
            attempted  to  maintain  a  given  density  of information rather than
            represent every contour.  The effect of variable contour  interval  is
            shown  in  Figure  2.1.   The  information content is much more evenly
            spaced in the bottom section of the Figure than in the top, and  would
            result  in  a  better  (or at least more even) surface representation.
            This is an acceptable form  of  data  input,  and  can  speed  contour
            acquisition  using manual methods in areas of varying relief.  Contour
            strings can be supplemented by data strings for cliffs,  ridge,  river
            and  valley  lines to provide slope discontinuities, always bearing in
            mind that all locations will have to be tagged with height values.

            TRIANG offers a  triangulation  constraint  option  which  forces  the
            Delaunay triangulation to honour the connectivity of the original data
            strings, thus preventing triangles from "leaking" through contours and
            other strings, see Figure 2.2.

            If edge matching to adjacent DTMs is  required,  TRIANG  provides  the
            option  to  include  relevant post values from the adjacent DTI format
            DTM as edge control to the current triangulation.

            Output from TRIANG  is  in  the  form  of  binary  node  and  Thiessen
            neighbour  files.   These  are  used  directly by TRIEDIT (editor) and
            TRIGRID (grid creation).

            It is possible that when a data structure has been created it contains
            defects  caused  by insufficient or incorrect data in certain areas of
            the  map  leading  to   the   incorrect   definition   of   particular
            characteristics of the shape.  Examples of this type of flaw could be:

            1.  inaccurate location of nodes,

            2.  inaccurate node flagging,

            3.  inaccurate node height values.


            TRIEDIT may be used to insert extra nodes or strings of nodes into the
            existing  network  in  such a manner that links along the strings will
            remain connected in the network irrespective of string point  spacing.
            This  is  particularly  important  for highway engineering examples or
            other boundary limit situations where the spacing between  the  points
            may  well lead to severe "breaking" of discontinuity lines if included
            in the original data structuring.

            The process of data insertion in TRIEDIT assumes permanent connections
            between  points  in an input string.  The resulting triangulation is a
            distortion of the Delaunay criterion, and hence any retriangulation of
            the  data  set  including  these  unbreakable  strings  could  lead to
            problems.  The  triangular  structure  modified  in  this  manner  can
            therefore only be used in TRIGRID and later phases.

            TRIDER takes the binary triangulation node and neighbour files created
            by  TRIANG (or edited output from TRIEDIT) and produces an output file
            containing slope derivatives at each data point in the  triangulation.
            These  data  may  then be used by TRIGRID in conjunction with the node
            and data files as the basis for DTM grid estimation.  Once TRIDER  has
            been  used to generate a slope derivative file many subsequent runs of
            TRIGRID may be made to produce DTM grids at differing resolutions.

            TRIDER is also used to provide  Z  values  for  the  imaginary  points
            generated  around  the  edge  of  the  triangulation  by TRIANG.  Four
            interpolation options are available for  imaginary  point  estimation,
            the  default  is  based on a trend surface fit through data points for
            which Z values are known.  TRIDER must be  re-run  to  produce  a  new
            derivative  file  every time the triangulation node and data files are
            modified.


            [1mTRIGRID[0m [1m-[0m [1mgrid[0m [1mgeneration[0m

            Grids (DTMs) of virtually unlimited  size  can  be  created  from  the
            spatial  structure  created  by  TRIANG  (or TRIEDIT) and TRIDER using
            TRIGRID.  The program automatically chops the DTM into  sections  that
            hold  as  many  rows  of  the DTM as possible for the amount of memory
            available.  An example of the grid  generation  process  is  shown  in
            Figure  2.3.   In  this  example,  three  passes through the neighbour
            network are needed to complete  the  grid.   The  program  will  often
            contain  the entire DTM at one pass.  For larger DTMs the program will
            automatically make the appropriate number of passes through  the  data
            to ensure that the grid is complete.

            The Thiessen  node-neighbour  file  created  by  TRIANG  supplies  the
            structure from which the triangles are generated.  These triangles are
            then mapped into the DTM (Figure 2.4) so that all grid nodes that fall
            within triangles are assigned values based on the values, and possibly
            the  estimated  derivatives,  at  the  vertices  of   the   triangles.
            Triangles can be dumped quickly into the DTM without need for point in
            polygon checks.

            TRIGRID uses two methods of interpolating the height value for a  grid
            node position within a given triangle area:

            1.  Interpolation based on a  linear  triangle  facet.   Although  the
                interior  triangle surface will be smooth, none of the derivatives
                along the triangle edges or at the vertices will be continuous.

  General                                                          12 October 1992


            2.  Interpolation using a smooth surface patch fitted to the  triangle
                vertices  and  estimated  derivatives in a manner to ensure both a
                continuous  surface  and   at   least   continuous   first   order
                derivatives.


            The linear facet approach results in a  perfectly  acceptable  surface
            where  the  data  density  is  high  in  relation  to  the  grid being
            generated, or the surface gradient is low.  In  such  cases  the  flat
            facet  of  any  triangle will probably supply only one or two nodes of
            the final DTM, and will have a  slope  in  close  agreement  with  the
            actual surface.

            Smooth surface interpolation requires considerable  computation  owing
            to  the  irregular  triangle  shapes  but will be worthwhile where the
            surface is considered  "smooth"  -  for  instance  where  the  DTM  is
            intended  to  represent not terrain but some thematic variable such as
            gravity data isarithms.  The requirements for many DTMs are,  however,
            rather  different.   In  the  case of terrain the existence of varying
            morphology within the DTM area -  plains,  rolling  hills,  mountains,
            cliffs,  lakes  and  sea  shores - may make the use of a smooth curved
            patch function essential.   The  patch  must  be  continuous  but  not
            necessarily  all directions.  For instance where a ridge or river line
            indicates a discontinuity that discontinuity must be reflected in  the
            patch  covering  the triangle area.  Other limitations may also apply.
            For instance where contour data has been used,  and  in  all  possible
            contours  of  a  fixed  height interval are present, the interpolation
            procedure must not give a value that is above the next contour height,
            or below the last one.

            When using smooth patch interpolation an option is provided  to  apply
            automatic  interpolation limits which take into account triangle facet
            slope and the feature codes of the triangle vertex points.

            TRIGRID offers an option to trace along the original data strings upon
            which  the  triangulation  is  based.   Up-hill/down-hill side of line
            information is collected  for  each  string.   This  may  be  used  to
            supplement  or  override the slope derivatives estimated for triangles
            which have all three vertices at the same height on the  same  string,
            eg a contour.

            Estimation of the derivatives at  each  data  point  is  an  essential
            precursor  to  any  smooth  patch calculation.  This process employs a
            separate pass through the Thiessen node-neighbour file to enable local
            distance   weighted   estimates  of  the  partial  derivatives  to  be
            calculated.

            Figure  2.5  shows  both  the  standard  situation   with   continuity
            guaranteed  across  the  triangle  and between triangles, and also the
            desired situation where a river is  present  along  one  side  of  the
            triangle.  The same situation can occur on one, two or all three sides
            of the triangle in cases such as lakes and coastal margins.  For  most
            geologic  mapping from randomly located data the situation on the left
            is the preferred result.   For  topographic  or  geologically  faulted
            surfaces however, the example on the right may be the required surface
            form.  This causes problems!

            The objections to grid based methods are:

            1.  considerable computer time to interpolate a large regular grid  to
                represent relatively few data points,

            2.  lack of flexibility in responding to variable  data  densities  in
                different parts of a map,

            3.  non-honouring of data points caused by insufficiently fine a  grid
                in order to keep computer time down to reasonable levels, and

            4.  difficulty in  representing  fault  information  adequately  on  a
                continuous surface.


            These have led  to  the  intensive  development  in  recent  years  of
            alternative methods of generating contour maps.

            The two most widely known are methods based on  triangulation  of  the
            data  set, and the process of contour following without either grid or
            triangulation as a guide.

            The human cartographer, given a scattered data set  to  contour,  will
            visualize  a  set of triangles in the area in which he is working that
            helps him locate the contour he is tracing.  These triangles  have  no
            existence  but provide a structure for him to use to estimate position
            of the contour line relative to other  data  points.   It  would  seem
            likely  that  an  automated  approach  that  did  the  same would have
            considerable benefits, particularly as it would always honour all data
            points   -  as  the  data  points  would  form  the  vertices  of  the
            triangulation.  This approach is summarised in Figure  3.1  where  the
            data  points  connected by a triangulation can then be contoured using
            linear approximations across the planar facets of the  triangles  that
            have  been created.  There used to be little interest in the automatic
            triangulation of seismic and other data sets because:

            1.  it appeared impossible to generate  the  same  triangulation,  and
                hence  the same map, from the same set of data, independent of the
                starting point of the triangulation process, and

            2.  the  time  taken  for  automatic  triangulation  was   exorbitant.
                Although  the  time taken for gridding is related to the square of
                the number of data  points,  some  of  the  methods  of  automatic
                triangulation were at best related to the cube!


            Improvements  in  the  last  ten  years  have  now  produced  reliable
            triangulation  procedures  that  produce  the  'most equilateral' (and
            therefore  unique)  set  of  triangles   possible   -   the   Delaunay
            triangulation  -  in  a  time  linearly  related to the number of data
            points, and without the need for large computer  memory  requirements.
            Some  of the multitude of alternative names for the same procedure (or
            its dual) found in the literature are Thiessen, Vorodonoi,  Dirichlet,
            and  Deltri.  For any given data set it is now much faster to generate
            unsmoothed contours from an  automatic  triangulation  procedure  than
            from  use of a grid interpolation approach.  At the same time all data
            points are honoured, the resolution of the map varies  with  the  data
            density, and maps can be joined together without error at the margins.

            The problem with the triangulation  technique  is  presently  that  of
            smooth  contouring.   A  number of 'patch' functions exist as for grid
            contouring, but their calculation is more involved because the network
            of  triangles  is irregular and no calculation short cuts can be wrung
            from nice orthogonal axes.  Smooth contouring from triangles presently
            takes  two  to  five  times longer than smooth contouring of a regular
            rectangular grid.

            A major reason for the upsurge of interest in triangulation techniques
            has  been  that  they  are  ideally suited to fault insertion.  If the
            fault location is entered as a set of data points,  the  triangulation
            process  will  include  them and will automatically relate them to the
            rest of the data set.  Then, the triangulation can  be  'unzipped'  so
            that  there  is no direct connection in the data structure between the
            two halves of the fault.  Contouring  can  then  take  place  and  the
            result will be a perfect edge to the fault depending only on the input
            resolution of the fault line.

            Any triangulation that is to be used for the  basis  of  isarithm  map
            production must have the properties of stability, equilateralness, and
            non-intersection.  It is desirable that  the  triangulation  resulting
            from any data distribution should be independent of the starting point
            of  the  triangulation  process  inside  the  distribution.   This  is
            particularly important in cases where ambiguity of triangulation might
            be expected to occur, for instance where four  near  equidistant  data
            points  could  be  divided  into  two triangles in either of two ways.
            From the triangulation view point there would  be  little  difference,
            but  in terms of the contoured surface there could be dramatic changes
            related not to real variation but purely to the imposed triangulation.
            Any triangular approach usually attempts to achieve a set of triangles
            that are as equilateral as possible with minimum  line  strength.   In
            the past this has often meant iterative processes such as those in SCA
            (1975)  and  GTN  (1977)  that  attempted  refinement  of  an  initial
            triangulation.   This  did  not  produce  a  unique  solution, and was
            expensive in computer time.

            Brassel and Reif (1979) published a paper concerning the  sub-division
            of a two-dimensional area into Thiessen polygons based on the location
            of a set of random data points.  Their method is related  to  work  by

            (1978), Gold (1977) and Elfick ( 1979).  The Thiessen  polygon  is  an
            important  concept in geographical thought as it can be used to define
            the region of influence of any point in a real context.  It is however
            only  one  form  of  display  of the final solution in that instead of
            showing the regions surrounding points it is also possible to  connect
            the  neighbouring  points, or Thiessen neighbours, to produce the dual
            of  Thiessen  polygons,  the   Delauney   triangulation.    The   same
            calculation  procedure  that calculates one can be use to generate the
            other.  Figure 3.2 shows the relation between  the  Delauney  triangle
            connecting  a  point  with  its  neighbours  and  the Theissen polygon
            surrounding a points.  In Brassel and Reif's case the polygon  network
            was  the most important.  In the present instance the triangulation is
            wanted.

            The Delaunay  triangulation  (Delaunay,  1934)  has  all  the  desired
            properties for use as a base for automatic contouring.  The problem of
            calculating the triangulation is closely  akin  to  that  of  Thiessen
            polygon  generation  but  certain  modifications  can  be  made  which
            increase the speed of computation, help the algorithm reach linearity,
            and  allow certain calculations to be omitted.  The only major problem
            is that considered by Yoeli (1977) related to  the  representation  of
            known  topographic  structure  where  'break-lines'  may  have  to  be
            included to maintain ridges and valleys.  More recently there has been
            a  great  increase of interest in triangulation approaches to mapping,
            and a number of algorithms and  reviews  have  appeared  (Sabin  1980,
            Peucker 1980, Sibson 1981, Watson 1982).

            The Brassel and Reif algorithm  approaches  the  problem  of  Thiessen
            polygon  formation  by  choosing  an  arbitrary starting point and, as
            necessity demands, creating a set of imaginary  guaranteed  neighbours
            outside  the  data area to be polygonised.  Once a known neighbour has
            been determined by this arbitrary starting method each neighbour of  a
            given  point  can be found by rotation about that point in a clockwise
            direction, at the same  time  building  up  an  index  list  of  other
            neighbourhood relationships for use later on.

            The algorithm works on a one-dimensionally sorted data list and has to
            check  a  considerable  number  of points that may be the correct next
            neighbour out of the neighbours surrounding the data  points.   Figure
            3.3  illustrates  the  principle.   If  point  0  is  the  point whose
            neighbours are to be discovered and 1 is a known neighbour,  the  line
            0-1  is  a  base  from  which  the  next  rightmost  neighbour  can be
            determined.   A  new  rightmost  neighbour  has  been  found  when   a
            circumscribing  circle  passing  through the base line 0-1 and the new
            point, 2, contains within it no other data point.  The line  0-2  then
            becomes  the  new  base-line  and  point  3  can  be found as the next
            neighbour, and so on around the rotation point, 0, until  point  1  is
            reached  again.   At this time all the neighbours of point 0 have been
            defined and a Thiessen polygon for point 0 could  be  calculated.   In

            the  Brassel  and Reif algorithm the formation of the Theissen polygon
            coincides with the discovery of the neighbours.  While the  neighbours
            for  the  rotation point are being discovered it is possible to update
            indices of the neighbours for all connected points,  greatly  reducing
            calculation  effort  at  later  stages.   In  a  random data set about
            two-thirds of all calculations will have already been made by the time
            any  given  data  point  is  investigated.  It should be noted that if
            Delaunay triangulation is required no polygon calculation is necessary
            as it is simply the triangle set indicated by ABCD etc in Figure 3.3.


            [1mProblems[0m

            Much of the Brassel and Reif algorithm is related to searching for the
            next  neighbour  for a given base line.  In Figure 3.3 their method is
            to calculate the centre and radius of the  circumscribing  circle  for
            some  suitable  starting  point  using  points from the sorted list to
            define the area of search.  If a point is found inside  the  circle  a
            new  centre and radius are calculated for the new circumscribed circle
            and the process iterates until all possible points in the sorted  list
            have  been  checked.  This process has two disadvantages.  First, in a
            direction perpendicular to the sort there is  no  segregation,  so  by
            using  a singly sorted list the band of points to be considered within
            the radius of the present circumscribing circle can be  very  numerous
            in  a  large  data  set.   It  would  appear  therefore  that  a  two-
            dimensional sort structure should be used to minimise  searching  time
            for any given point.  Associated with the single direction sort is the
            fact that all points in the sorted list within the radius limit bounds
            have  to be checked.  There is no way of checking the points which are
            nearer the base line in preference to those which are less  likely  to
            be neighbours because they lie further away.

            The second problem relates to the amount of  calculation  involved  in
            determining the new circumscribing circle centre and radius.  Although
            some method must be used to determine point position in relation to  a
            possible  circumscribing  circle  the  centre  calculation  should  be
            avoided  for  Delaunay  triangulation  as  it   necessarily   involves
            considerable floating point calculation and should be used only when a
            Thiessen vertex needs to be calculated and all neighbours are known.

            A major strength of their approach, however, is that it  enables  them
            to  proceed  in  a  logical spatial manner through the data set, never
            covering the same ground again.  Once neighbours have been  determined
            no  more  points  will  be  found  in  that  region.   This  makes for
            considerable economy in storage.

            points.  It can be seen by inspection that the points,  A,  B,  and  C
            form  a  set  of  Thiessen  neighbours  and a Delaunay triangle as the
            circumscribing circle through those points includes no other points in
            the  data distribution.  This is also the case for all other triangles
            shown in the network on the right of Figure 3.4.

            In all triangulation systems there is a boundary problem that must  be
            solved  in some manner.  The points lying within the data window (left
            box, Figure 3.4) may well not be isolated but only part  of  a  larger
            data  set.  If this is the case any arbitrary triangulation around the
            outside of the  present  data  area  must  be  incorrect.   As  it  is
            impossible  to  know  what  lies outside the data window some boundary
            condition must be set up to act as a frame and to  provide  a  set  of
            boundary  triangles  so that isarithms can be extrapolated outside the
            present apparent data area.  Many possibilities exist for this but one
            of the most efficient is to place a set of imaginary points around the
            outside of the area, just outside the data window.   The  position  of
            these  imaginary points is shown on the right of Figure 3.4, as is the
            Delaunay triangular relationship with  the  real  data  points.   Once
            these  imaginary  points  have been added to the original data set the
            whole area can be triangulated starting with  any  pair  of  imaginary
            points  as  initial  known  neighbours.   The  question  of  how  many
            imaginary points should be used and their distribution  is  considered
            later.

            [1mData[0m [1mstructure[0m

            A suitable data structure that enables fast access to points lying  in
            the  immediate  proximity  of  others  according  to Knuth (1973) is a
            two-dimensional sort that can be likened to a box  structure.   Figure
            3.5  shows  a simplified data set containing some 16 points.  A single
            sort in the X direction results in the X order shown at the bottom  of
            the  diagram  and  similarly  the  result of a Y order is given to the
            right of the diagram.  Only the four points labelled 1, 4, 8,  and  12
            have  been  entered  in  the  X  and  Y  order.  If first a Y order is
            performed, and  then  multiple  X  orders,  a  box  structure  can  be
            achieved.   The  Y  order  has  first  been  split  into a series of Y
            sections.

            This operation of putting data points in boxes is very fast and linear
            as  no sorting is necessary.  A division of the X and Y coordinates by
            the box side length provides an instant  reference  to  the  box  that
            contains  the  point.   In  Figure  3.5 boxes A and B form the first Y
            section and C and D the second section.  Each Y section is then sorted
            in  terms  of X and the resulting X order can be divided into sections
            in its turn thus segregating A and B into  separate  boxes  and  later
            segregating C and D when the second Y section has been put in X order.
            The result is to create a succession of points in an  ordered  listing
            such  that  each  row of boxes is in Y order, but the data inside each
            box is in X order.  An index to the first point in each box  can  then
            be  created  as  in  the  right  of  Figure 3.5.  Given the coordinate
            position of any point in the area it is then very  fast  to  find  the
            boxes  that will contain its probable neighbours.  In the simple 2 x 2
            box structure of Figure 3.5 there is only  a  small  advantage  to  be
            gained.  The larger the data set, however, the greater the saving will
            be providing the box structure becomes similarly more detailed.

            An immediate  question  is  the  number  of  points  which  should  be
            contained  on  average  within  each  box  in  order  to  maximise the
            likelihood of finding the desired Theissen  neighbour  as  quickly  as
            possible.   As  the  search procedure is local both the rotation point
            and the known neighbour of Figure 3.3 will often  exist  in  the  same
            box.   As the rightmost neighbour is wanted in the clockwise algorithm
            of Figure 3.3, the data distribution is assumed random,  and  the  two
            base  line  points are probably in the box.  An average of four points
            seems reasonable.  Very few redundant points will  be  searched  while
            looking for the Thiessen neighbour for any given base line.

            Of course  base  line  length  will  be  variable  depending  on  data
            distribution.   In  those  cases where the base line is very long, the
            number of boxes containing on average four points that will have to be
            opened  and  searched  will  be  quite large.  They will not, however,
            contain as many points as if a uni-dimensional sort was employed.

            Figure 3.6 shows the application of the structure to  a  more  complex
            data  set.   Here  the  total  data set includes about 80 points which
            leads to a rectangular 20 box structure with 5 boxes along the X  axis
            and  4 boxes down the Y axis.  A single sort algorithm would search on
            the basis of an outwards-inwards approach  in  that  the  points  most
            likely to be found first and considered as neighbours are those likely
            to lie furthest away from the base line.  On  average  many  incorrect

            neighbours will be tested before the right point is found.

            A better approach would be  to  attempt  to  find  the  most  probable
            neighbours  first,  thus reducing calculation but giving a complicated
            program structure.  In Figure 3.5 the base line A-B has  the  rotation
            point B and known neighbour A.  As the algorithm is always looking for
            the most clockwise neighbour only points above the diagonal line  need
            be  considered.  All boxes below the diagonal line can be ignored.  It
            is clear from the diagram  that  the  neighbour  that  will  form  the
            Delaunay  triangle is included in box 14 and happens to lie within the
            circle of which line A-B is a diameter.  An efficient  starting  point
            for  a  search  would  therefore be one that considered in the initial
            cases all boxes covered by the circle with A-B as diameter - boxes  13
            and  14.  Any points below the line A-B could be discarded immediately
            leaving  four  possible  neighbours.   These  could  then  be  checked
            individually  using either the circumscribed circle centre calculation
            approach of Brassel and Reif or alternatively using  a  faster  method
            proposed  later in this Chapter.  It is possible that the point, while
            lying within a box that is to be searched,  may  not  lie  within  the
            circle  shown in Figure 3.6.  If no other points exist in boxes 13 and
            14  other  than  points  A  and  B  the  preliminary  search  will  be
            unsuccessful.  It will, however, have taken very little time as search
            time is only related to points that are present, and opening a box  to
            check  its  contents  is very fast.  If boxes 13 and 14 had been empty
            the search would then have enlarged over the surrounding area of boxes
            15, 18, 19 and 20 according to the inwards-outwards rule.  It is worth
            comparing the average number of points likely to be searched using the
            outwards-inwards  approach  and the inwards-outwards approach.  In the
            former the equivalent of  approximately  5  boxes  would  be  searched
            containing  on average 4 points, giving a total of 20 points.  Many of
            these would not involve a complete check as they are on the wrong side
            of  the  line  or  obviously  too far away, but would be perfunctorily
            checked.  Using the alternative approach  only  on  average  8  points
            would  be  checked,  with only partial checking of many of the points.
            In a large data set, the box structure  still  on  average  holding  4
            points,  the  necessary  search  would still require 8 points.  In the
            single  sort  method  the   number   considered   would   have   risen
            dramatically.

            An inwards-outwards search involves an iterative expansion of the area
            being  searched  if  no suitable points are found.  If there are large
            empty areas in the data set there will be  a  large  number  of  empty
            boxes.    As   these  can  be  searched  very  quickly  speed  is  not
            significantly degraded in the empty areas.  There  is,  however,  some
            decrease  in  speed  in  the  populated areas as, although the average
            contents per box would have been four,  the  actual  contents  in  the
            populated  area  will  be proportionately higher to compensate for the
            empty areas.  The process of iterative expansion is  shown  in  Figure
            3.7  indicating the method of determining the Delaunay triangle and of
            resolving problem cases.  The algorithms always start from a  rotation
            point  and  a  known  neighbour  which  form  a  base line for further
            computation.  The area of interest for the first search is defined  as
            the  series  of boxes covered by the circle having as its diameter the

            base line.  A first approximation is that the boxes to be searched are
            those  covered  by  the square that encloses the circle.  This ensures
            fast determination of the desired area but can lead to difficulties at
            the  corners  of  the square but outside the search circle.  In Figure
            3.7 point 3 can be seen to lie within circle A and would definitely be
            the Thiessen neighbour required to form the Delaunay triangle with the
            base line.  As it is quite possible that more than one point will  lie
            within   the  circle  it  is  important  to  be  able  to  distinguish
            immediately which point inside the search circle will be the  Thiessen
            neighbour.

            Consider a point lying on circle A on the clockwise side of  the  base
            line.   Wherever  that point may fall the angle subtends from the base
            line to that point will always be the same.  In the special case  when
            the base line is the diameter of the circle that angle will be a right
            angle.  Any point lying outside circle A will have an angle more acute
            and  any  point  inside subtended an angle more obtuse than the circle
            perimeter angle.  Simple geometry shows that the desired neighbour  is
            the  point  lying  inside  the  circle  which  has  the  largest angle
            subtended from the base line.  Point  3  will  have  an  angle  rather
            greater than 90 .  If there were another point inside circle A as well
            as point 3 and its angle were larger than that subtended  by  point  3
            then  it  would  be the Thiessen neighbour and would form the Delaunay
            triangle.

            Imagine that circle A has no point inside it.  The search circle  area
            must  then be increased by some factor to the size indicated by circle
            B.  All boxes covered by the square enclosing circle B are then opened
            and  the  points  inside  inspected.   Points  1, 2, 4 and 10 would be
            discovered.  The only  point  subtending  an  angle  larger  than  the
            perimeter  angle  of  circle  B would be point 4 and hence it would be
            discovered as a neighbour.  The inefficiency of  using  the  enclosing
            square  rather  than  the circle B as the search area is that point 10
            would be investigated as it lies within the  square  but  outside  the
            circle but would be discarded as its subtending angle is less than the
            circle B perimeter angle.  This inefficiency can be  quite  useful  in
            that  if  no  points  exist  inside  the search circle the new maximum
            search circle that need be employed is that which would include  point
            10  on  its  perimeter  rather than the much larger circle C in Figure
            3.7.  Thus, although point 10 would be  ignored  in  the  presence  of
            point 1, 2 and 4, it would serve as a limitation for further search if
            those interior points were not present.

            It is  possible  that  in  some  cases,  particularly  with  regularly
            distributed  data,  more  than one point may lie exactly on the circle
            perimeter whereas no points lie inside the circle.  It is necessary to
            employ a decision rule to decide which (in Figure 3.7) of the points 1
            and 2 should be chosen as the Thiessen neighbour of the rotation point
            and  the  known neighbour.  The angles subtended at points 1 and 2 are
            the same, but in terms of a clockwise  rotation  around  the  rotation
            point it is clear that point 1 should be chosen in preference to point
            2.  The correct neighbour can be determined once the point closest  to
            the  known  neighbour and the point closest to the rotation point have

            been determined.  The chosen point is the one that is closest  to  the
            known  neighbour  providing  it  is  not  also closest to the rotation
            point.

            If no points are found in either circle A or B the search circle would
            be enlarged again to size C.  This process could continue indefinitely
            at the edge of the data  point  distribution  as  there  would  be  no
            further points to discover and no limit to which the circle size could
            be increased that would discover any  further  points.   This  is  one
            reason  why  the  imaginary points that lie outside the data window in
            Figure 3.4 are essential.  Any expanding circle search inside the data
            area  will  be halted at some stage by contact with an imaginary point
            that will always be able to form a Delaunay  triangle  and  act  as  a
            Theissen  neighbour.   When  the rotation point is itself an imaginary
            point as is the known neighbour, further effort is  abandoned  as  the
            two  points  are  already  known  to  be  neighbours.  It is therefore
            essential to include the imaginary points in the basic  box  structure
            of  the  data.  Every perimeter box contains one imaginary data point.
            This ensures that a limit is set on all searches no matter which boxes
            are opened during a search for a neighbour.

            The increase in circle size at each phase of a  possible  search  must
            ensure  that  the absolute minimum of redundant searching is performed
            and that the circle area does not grow so rapidly that a  vast  number
            of  new points are found.  A reasonable area increase lies between two
            and three times for each circle expansion.  If the base line  is  very
            small  this  is usually indicative of an area in the window where data
            is densely packed.  Although absolute circle size growth will be slow,
            it is likely a neighbour will be found very quickly.  If the base line
            is large there is always the possibility that an over large number  of
            points  will  be  searched,  but as the algorithm starts with the base
            line as diameter, as in Figure 3.7, even then  the  number  of  points
            being searched is unlikely to be too excessive.

            The triangulations resulting  from  many  triangular  mapping  program
            systems  have  been  critically affected by the choice of the starting
            point for  the  triangulation  process.   It  is  essential  that  the
            triangulation  should  be  stable within the data area irrespective of
            starting position.  This is particularly necessary to ensure that maps
            of consecutive areas can be overlapped successfully without join marks
            so that updating and modification of maps  can  be  performed  without
            complete   redrawing   of  an  entire  area.   Figure  3.8  shows  the
            triangulated data set of Figure 3.4 in two  orientations.   In  A  the
            orientation  is  the  same  as in Figure 3.4 and in b the data set has
            been rotated through 180 degrees.  As the Delaunay network is  unique,
            the  triangulation  is  the  same  in  both  cases.   The  process  of
            triangulation is in both cases that of an expanding wave.

            As an arbitrary decision the bottom left hand corner is chosen as  the
            starting  point.  The neighbours for the bottom left hand corner point
            are those in contact with shell 1  in  Figure  3.8.   Thus  after  the
            points  on  shell  1 are found we have complete rotational information
            for the lower left corner point and partial information for the points

            lying  on  shell  1.  The information available for these shell points
            concerns all their relationships to the previous shell.  At the  start
            the  only  information available is related to their neighbours on the
            first shell and to the original starting point, which is on  shell  0.
            Each  point  on shell 1 is then considered in turn as a rotation point
            and a new set of neighbours built up on shell 2.  By the time shell  2
            is  complete  all neighbours for points on shell 1 have been found and
            some of the  neighbours  for  shell  2  including  all  neighbours  on
            previous  shells.  For both Figure 3.8A and 3.8B the process continues
            shell after shell until by shell 6 all neighbours for all points  have
            been  found.   Every  point  is  only visited as a rotation point once
            unless its neighbours  have  already  been  discovered  from  previous
            rotation  points  in  which  case it is complete.  An updating process
            enables track to be kept of all the relationships.   Investigation  of
            the  length  of  each shell indicates that in large data sheets only a
            small proportion of the points exist on any  given  shell.   As  these
            points are the only active ones in terms of finding new neighbours and
            also for the relationships between points, they are the only ones that
            need  to  be kept in memory.  Relationships that have to be maintained
            for instant  reference  are  kept  quite  small.   The  algorithm  can
            therefore  be run equally efficiently on small or large computers.  In
            all, the number of active relationship lists that need be kept will be
            on  average  approximately  1.5 times the square root of the number of
            data points for a randomly distributed data set, with  six  items  per
            list.

            Although the same starting location was used  for  both  A  and  B  in
            Figure  3.8,  the  shell  formation  is different as it adjusts to the
            different data distribution encountered.  The  final  pattern  of  the
            triangulation, however, is the same.

            In Laser-Scan DTM software a rather different order of calculation  is
            used.   The  first  shell includes all the imaginary points.  Thus the
            shells are circular.  This uses rather more memory as the  live  shell
            is  approximately  4 times the square root of the number of points (at
            maximum).

  [1mFUNCTION[0m

            TRIANG is the main data structuring program in the DTMCREATE  package.
            Its  purpose  is  to  extract heighted data from IFF (Internal Feature
            Format) files and existing DTMs held in DTI  (Digital  Terrain  Image)
            files to produce a triangular data structure.

  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m


  [1mGeneral[0m

            TRIANG can handle input  from  IFF  (Internal  Feature  Format)  files
            consisting  of  strings  of  contour, seismic, or other types of data,
            marked as either continuous or discontinuous data  points  or  cliffs.
            In  addition  data  can  be  input  from existing DTI (Digital Terrain
            Image) format DTM files as an aid to intra-DTM edge matching.

            The input data are  used  to  form  a  Delaunay  triangulation.   This
            provides  a  structure  that  relates  every  point  with its Thiessen
            neighbours.  The triangulation is optimum in the sense that it has the
            most  equilateral  set  of  triangles  possible for the data set under
            consideration.  This does  not  necessarily  imply  that  locally  the
            triangles will be very equilateral.

            As an alternative to production of an optimal Delaunay triangulation a
            CONSTRAINT option is offered.  This option forces the triangulation to
            honour the connectivity of contour, coastline and river  strings  etc.
            such  that  no  string is cut through by a triangle.  This approach is
            more suitable for the definition of complex geomorphological  surfaces
            than   the   Delaunay   ideal   and   is   strongly   recommended  for
            geomorphological surface modelling.

            TRIANG enables the user to apply feature flagging to the incoming data
            points  to  identify  each  point as either a river point, a ridgeline
            point or an unflagged point.  This deature  flagging  is  used  within
            TRIGRID to control the limits applied to smooth surface interpolation.

            [1mCoordinate[0m [1msystem[0m

            DTMCREATE assumes absolute  coordinates,  (i.e.   all  coordinates  in
            input  files  are  offset  by  the  file  (X,Y)  origin offset) in the
            specification of windows and positions.

            The UNITS command enables  the  user  to  specify  in  what  units  of
            measurement  he  wishes  to  define the triangulation window using the
            WINDOW command, or in what  units  of  measurement  details  from  the
            header of the DTI file are displayed.

            By default metre units are assumed.

            The UNITS command should be given before specifying the  triangulation
            window  the  user  wishes  to  specify  the window in units other than
            metres.

            Currently the projection information for the  first  input  file  read
            with  a FILEIN command is copied to the .NOD and .DTA output files for
            subsequent use in setting up the header of  the  LSLA  type  DTI  file
            created  in  TRIGRID.   In  a  future release of DTMCREATE, coordinate
            consistency checks between input files will be implemented.

  [1mOutput[0m [1mdata[0m [1mfiles[0m

            Output from module TRIANG is in the form  of  two  binary  files,  not
            directly   readable   by  the  user.   For  details  of  default  file
            specifications used for the binary output files see the FILEIN command
            section below.

            The binary output files are used  to  convey  the  triangulation  data
            structure  between  the various modules of the DTMCREATE package.  The
            first file (filename.DTA) contains the data in  scaled  integer  form,
            together  with  various indices and tables concerning the distribution
            of the data over the triangulation area.  This data set  is  augmented
            by  a set of imaginary points acting as a frame around the edge of the
            map area.  The second file (filename.NOD) contains the data  structure
            itself with a list of the neighbours of each data point in the set.

            These triangulation files must always be handled as matched pairs,  as
            the  data  contained  in  one  is the key to the inter-node structures
            described in the other.  If one file is to be deleted then BOTH  files
            must  be deleted.  DTMCREATE modules TRIEDIT, TRIDER and TRIGRID which
            require input from .NOD and .DTA files check that the two files  share
            a common version number and complain if they do not!

            Never use the DCL SET FILE, RENAME  or  COPY  commands  to  alter  the
            version  numbers of mismatched .NOD and .DTA files to make them into a
            matched pair.

            Input to module TRIANG consists of contour and breakline  strings  and

            between these different file types the FORMAT command should be used.

            TRIANG is designed to be compatible with  the  "new"  type  IFF  files
            introduced  in  conjunction with the IMP (IFF Map Processing) package.
            The origin offset entry in a type 2 MD (Map  Descriptor)  is  used  to
            offset coordinate values within an input IFF file.  Although downwards
            compatible with "old" type IFF files a warning message is issued if an
            IFF  file  is  found  not  to contain a set type 2 MD (Map Descriptor)
            entry.

            Data within IFF files may have string type and feature type attributes
            assigned  within  TRIANG  via  the  IFF feature code and layer values.
            Commands such as  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC,  ASSIGN  RIDGE_LAYER  etc  are
            provided to make the feature type/code assignments to enable TRIANG to
            realize that a string is to be stored as a breakline  or  a  ridgeline
            etc.

            TRIANG scales all the input coordinates of the IFF file  into  integer
            form  in  order  to speed up calculations.  The range of integers into
            which the coordinates will be scaled will lie between 0 and 300000  by
            default.

            However, the user may define a logical,  LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION,  to
            be a value between 300000 and 10000000 to increase this resolution and
            will default to 300000 if it is not given.

            The purpose of this is because very dense datasets could  have  points
            so  close  together  that  TRIANG  would become 'stuck' or produce the
            STOPNOD error message as it was unable to distinguish between them.

                                          IMPORTANT

                    It   is   essential    that    the    logical    value
                    LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION  remains  the same when going
                    from TRIANG all  the  way  through  to  TRIGRID  on  a
                    particular  dataset.   If  the  resolution  is altered
                    between any of the stages, unpredictable results  will
                    occur and programs may fail.

            Cliff lines heights may be transmitted in one of two ways:

               1.  The IFF feature contains two  constant  floating  point  height
                   values;  one  for  the  terrain  to  the  left of the cliffline
                   (relative to the direction  of  digitising)  and  one  for  the
                   height  of  the  terrain to the right.  The left hand height is
                   held in a type 80 AC and the right hand height in a type 81 AC.

               2.  The cliffline coordinates have  per-point  attributes  for  the
                   height  on the left and right of the cliffline (relative to the
                   direction of digitising).   This  enables  clifflines  to  have
                   heights  which  vary along their top and bottom.  The per-point
                   attributes are held  in  CB  (Coordinate  Block)  entries.   CB
                   entries  replace  the  use  of  ST  (STring) and ZS (3D string)
                   entries.

                   IFF features which represent clifflines will have the  X,Y  and
                   two attribute fields set for each coordinate in their CBs.  The
                   attributes are 80 ("cliff left height") and  81  ("cliff  right
                   height"),  both of which contain a real (floating point) height
                   value.

                   To generate CB entries containing  (X,Y,Cliff-left,Cliff-right)
                   coordinates,  the  user  will  have  to digitise the clifflines
                   using LITES2 with the IFF output revision level set to 1.   For
                   details  of IFF input and output revision levels and the use of
                   LITES2 for the generation of  CBs  see  the  MAPPING  Reference
                   Manual and the LITES2 Reference Manual.

                   LITES2 macros can be set up to facilitate digitising  cliffline
                   features which are to receive varying Z values along their left
                   and right sides.  The following  unsophisticated  examples  are
                   provided for guidance:

                   This command sequence could be typed into a LITES2 command file
                   and the command file read at the start of the LITES2 session by
                   use of the LITES2 @'file-spec' command.

                   If possible a puck or function  button  should  be  defined  to
                   issue  each  of  the  two macros.  A single press of the button
                   defined for the CLIFF_START macro will then cause the  user  to
                   be  prompted  for  the left and right height and the point will
                   then  be  inserted  with  the  appropriate  attribute   values.
                   Subsequent  points  should  be  inserted using the same button.
                   The button defined for the CLIFF_STOP macro should  be  pressed
                   to insert the last point in the cliff string.

                   It is essential that the user  sets  the  IFF  output  revision
                   level  to 1, before starting the LITES2 session.  Failure to do
                   this will result in all the  per-point  attributes  being  lost
                   when the user exits the LITES2 session.

            IFF files are read into TRIANG using the FILEIN  command.   More  then
            one  input  file  may be specified using a new FILEIN command for each
            file.  Defaults may be changed between reading files.  This means that
            IFF  files  with  different  allocations  of  IFF  entries  for height
            information  or  with  heights  relative  to  different  data  may  be
            combined.

            Height information within a single IFF file may be stored relative  to
            different  height  data providing that the features pertaining to each
            height datum can be distinguished by feature code or layer.  The DATUM
            command  can  be  used to set the height datum for a subsequent FILEIN
            command.  If required, a single IFF file may be  read  in  many  times
            relative to different height data, feature selection being achieved by
            SELECT FC and SELECT LAYER commands.

            Imperial heights may be converted to metric on input with  the  ENABLE
            TOMETRES  command.   The  reverse  is  possible with the ENABLE TOFEET
            command.  Incoming heights may be multiplied  or  divided  by  a  user
            specified  constant  with  the  ENABLE  MULTIPLYBY and ENABLE DIVIDEBY
            commands respectively.

            Incoming heights may be inverted if  the  ENABLE  INVERSE  command  is
            specified  prior  to  reading  an IFF file.  This enables modelling of
            hydrographic data where  sea  depths  are  often  stored  as  positive
            heights, drying zone heights as negative and land heights as positive!

            [1mBREAKLINES[0m

            In order that all surface discontinuities are honoured  in  the  final
            DTM it may be necessary to designate some IFF strings as "breaklines",
            which will ensure a  change  of  slope  character  at  that  line.   A
            breakline  in  the  IFF  file may be identified by its feature code or
            position in a separate layer.  The allocation of IFF feature codes and
            layers  for  breaklines  must  be  input  to  TRIANG  using the ASSIGN
            BREAKLINE_FC and ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_LAYER  commands  respectively.   As
            with the IFF height storage mechanisms different allocations of layers
            and feature codes for breaklines may be made between successive FILEIN
            commands.

            As breaklines define important slope discontinuities in the landscape,
            it  is  important that their points are always retained.  TRIANG takes
            great care to ensure that breaklines are  never  violated  during  the
            (optional)  triangulation constraint phase, and that all river, coast,
            and isoline strings are cut where  crossed  by  a  breakline.   It  is
            therefore  important  that  care  is  exercised in the registration of
            breaklines relative to other source data during data preparation.

            It is recommended that breaklines,  clifflines  and  spot-heights  are
            read  in  before  the  bulk  of  contour  data.   Spot  heights  often
            contribute much to the form of hill tops and valley floors.  All other
            data  may  then follow, in an order reflecting the importance attached
            to the landscape elements which they describe.

            Once all the source data is read into  TRIANG,  triangulation  may  be
            started.   Unless the CONSTRAINT option has been enabled, (see below),
            at the end of the triangulation phase the binary files containing  the
            triangulation will be output.

            If  CONSTRAINT  is  in  force  the  following  procedure  is  adopted.
            TRIANG's  internal  workspace is reorganised and if necessary a random
            access disk  file  is  set  up  to  enable  rapid  selection  of  node
            neighbours.  Breaklines are identified and their course traced through
            the data structure.  If the neighbour list of the nth  node  does  not
            contain  a  reference  to  the  (nth + 1)  node  along a string then a
            logical break has occurred.  This break is repaired by  the  insertion
            of an additional point at the intersection of the line between the nth
            and (nth + 1) node in the string and every triangle  link  which  cuts
            that  line.   These  additional 'patch' nodes are stored in a separate
            area of workspace for later use.  The node neighbour lists are updated
            and  the next node in the breakline string is considered.  The process
            is repeated until all breakline strings  have  any  gaps  filled  with
            additional points.

            All the 'patches' of additional points  are  then  inserted  into  the
            breakline  gaps and the strings are reordered so that the patch points
            appear in the correct positions within the strings.  The whole process
            is  then  repeated  for non-breakline strings.  However, any breakline
            connections encountered while tracking along  a  non-breakline  string
            will  be  considered  inviolable  and the non-breakline string will be
            broken at the  intersection  point.   After  all  string  patching  is
            complete,  the (probably somewhat enlarged) intermediate files will be
            output to disk for use by TRIDER or TRIEDIT.

            The number of data points generated to patch strings  will  depend  on
            the  original  data  density  and  distribution of the data points.  A
            river containing points at 10cm intervals which lies between  contours
            having  points  at  1mm  intervals  will  probably  be cut by triangle
            connections many times.  Many points will be generated  in  the  river
            string  patches  to  restore  the  continuity  of  the string.  If the
            relative point density was reversed between the two  features,  it  is
            most unlikely that the river would be cut by triangle links at all.

            Cliffs are a comparatively complex feature to digitise as two  heights
            must be associated with each (X,Y) coordinate pair, one height for the
            right hand side of the cliffline and one for the left hand side.   The
            sides  of  the  cliff  line  are  defined relative to the direction of
            digitising.  (See [1mHeights[0m above).

            A cliff feature should be given a type 80 AC (Ancillary Code) to carry
            the height on the left side of the cliff (relative to the direction of
            digitising) and a type 81 AC (Ancillary Code) to carry the  height  on
            the right side of the cliff.

            A cliffline must have at least 4 points.

            Internally DTMCREATE supports 2 cliff data types:

            1.  open cliffs, which may rise out of  and  then  sink  back  into  a
                continuous  surface.   When  digitising  a  line  which  is  to be
                interpreted by TRIANG as an open cliff, care should  be  taken  to
                observe the following:

                    o  The locations of the first and last points in the digitised
                       string  should  not  lie  in such a position that each will
                       become a neighbour of the other within  the  triangulation.
                       If  they  do  fall  within each others neighbour lists, the
                       line will be treated as a closed cliff, with  a  continuous
                       top and bottom loop, (like an island in the sea).

                    o  TRIANG  will  treat  the  first  and  last  points  in  the
                       digitised line as the positions from which the cliff starts
                       to rise from the surface and finally  sink  back  into  the
                       surface.   The  distance  between  the  first to the second
                       point and the distance between the  penultimate  point  and
                       the  last  point  controls how rapidly the cliff rises from
                       and falls back into the surface.  If it is desired that the
                       cliff  should  rise  and  fall  abruptly at its ends, these
                       inter-point distances should be kept as small  as  possible
                       without digitising the points so close together that TRIANG
                       discards one of each on initial read-in.

                    o  The link between the first point and the  second,  and  the
                       penultimate  with  the  last  is  not  flagged as a line of
                       derivative discontinuity.

                    o  TRIANG will automatically assign  to  the  first  and  last
                       points  in  the string the minimum of the two cliff heights
                       (left and right)


            2.  Closed cliffs, which in plan form a continuous closed  loop,  (for
                example, an island in the sea or a lake).

                    o  The locations of the first and last points in the digitised
                       string  should lie in such a position that each will become
                       a neighbour of the other within the triangulation.  If they
                       do  not  fall  within  each others neighbour lists the line
                       will be treated as an open cliff, which rises from and then
                       sinks back into the surrounding surface.

            It is recommended that all  coastlines  are  defined  as  cliff  lines
            having  as  their seaward height 0.0 and their landward height 1.0 (or
            more).  This will ensure a clean "step" between land and  sea.   Water
            bodies   in   estuarine  areas  may  be  similarly  defined.   Because
            clifflines are treated as lines of surface discontinuity, their use at

            the edge of water bodies like the sea, ensures that no rippling of the
            flat water surface occurs.  Such surface rippling is a result  of  the
            use  of a smooth patch function as employed during DTM grid estimation
            within TRIGRID.

            In sea areas, if no other data lies between a coastal  cliff  and  the
            edge  of  the  triangulation area, a breakline of height 0.0 should be
            used along the edge of the triangulation area.  This will ensure  that
            heights  estimated for imaginary points along the edge of the sea area
            do no cause slopes in the sea!

            TRIANG can accept for  input  MIKE,  UHL1,  TED4  and  LSLA  type  DTI
            (Digital  Terrain Image) files.  The elevation data within these files
            may be held as word (default), real*4 and longword values.   Byte  and
            bit valued DTI files are not supported by DTMCREATE.

            TRIANG is designed to enable the user to edge  match  with  DTI  files
            which  contain null DTM post values (i.e.  post values which have been
            assigned a height value of -32767).  This is achieved by ignoring  all
            posts which have the null height value.

            TRIANG reads and interprets the header information from the input  DTI
            file.   DTI  files of type UHL1, TED4 and LSLA with projection record,
            contain an (X,Y) origin offset value for the SW corner (row 1,  column
            1)  of  the  file  in  the  file  header  information.   As  TRIANG is
            particularly concerned with the registration of the DTI file data with
            data  from  IFF input sources, unless the origin offset information is
            available from the file header, the user is prompted for the  position
            of the SW corner of the DTI file.

            The MIKE type of DTI header is now obsolete.  DTMCREATE  continues  to
            support  input  of data from this file type but it is recommended that
            the user converts any existing MIKE type DTI files  to  the  new  LSLA
            type  with  projection record by using the MATRIX utilities DTICONVERT
            and DTITRANS.  This gives the advantage that all the  file  locational
            information  is  stored  in  the  header  of an LSLA type DTI file and
            consequently the user is not prompted  for  manual  specificatyion  of
            origin offset coordinates at run time.

            It is important that the DTI file (X,Y) grid intervals and  the  value
            supplied  for  the  position  of  the  SW  corner  of the DTI file are
            expressed in the same units of measurement as used in  the  IFF  input
            files.   It  is  possible to change the header values in a DTI file by
            use of the MATRIX package DTIPATCH utility  although  care  should  be
            exercised  to  ensure  that  changes are made that are compatible with
            other stages of the production flowline.

            It is essential to ensure that all IFF data is  transformed  into  the
            coordinate  system  of  the  output  DTMs  prior  to  using DTMCREATE.
            Failure to do this will mean that the completed DTM will  have  to  be
            transformed using the MATRIX utility DTITRANS.

            Data extracted from DTI format DTM files are always read in as  normal
            3D  strings,  the  discrete  post values of a row or column of the DTI
            file being logically strung together for ease of data handling.

  [1mEDGE[0m [1mMATCHING[0m

            DTMCREATE maintains a concept of "imaginary points" which  lie  around
            the  edge  of a triangulation.  These are used to stop the DTM surface
            from "falling off the edge of the world" during surface fitting.  When
            created by TRIANG these imaginary points have location but no Z value.
            Later, when  estimating  slope  derivatives  TRIDER  offers  the  user
            several  interpolation  options  to estimate suitable Z values for the
            imaginary points at the edge of  the  triangulation.   Of  course  the
            resulting  heights  are  only estimates and it would be better to have
            actual data points available at the triangle vertices near the edge of
            the triangulation.

            DTMCREATE offers two approaches to edge matching  between  DTMs  using
            real data points:

            1.  Overlap of source  data  used  for  triangulation.   This  can  be
                achieved by triangulating data covering a bigger area than that of
                the final DTM.  The  overlap  area  that  this  approach  requires
                ensures   that  real  world,  rather  than  imaginary  control  is
                available for the edge of the DTM area.   When  the  adjacent  DTM
                area  is  triangulated, a corresponding overlap area is taken into
                the previously triangulated area.  The result  is  that  the  same
                control  points  are  available for DTM post estimation within the
                edge zone of both DTMs.  The same post values should then  result,
                plus or minus arithmetic rounding errors.

            2.  TRIANG allows the user to force the edges of adjacent DTMs to have
                common  post heights by supplying as data to TRIANG the edge posts
                of completed DTMs.  A maximum of 2 rows or columns should be  used
                and  are  selected  out  of  the  DTI file using the TRIANG WINDOW
                command in reference to the origin and extents of  the  DTI  file.
                Because the coincident posts of adjacent DTMs are treated as nodes
                in the  triangulation,  DTMCREATE  preserves  their  location  and
                height  throughout  the modelling process.  The end result is that
                exactly the same post values will  appear  in  both  models.   For
                perfect edge matching this is the recommended procedure.


            The DTMCREATE system assumes default  settings  for  all  options  and
            parameters unless otherwise specified.  The status for all options may
            be examined at any time using the SHOW ENABLE command.

            Although TRIANG offers the  user  a  bewildering  number  of  possible
            commands,  only  6 are obligatory for a successful TRIANG run.  TRIANG
            contains interlocks to ensure that processing steps cannot be  entered
            without having first defined the necessary defaults.

            The obligatory TRIANG command sequence is:

  WINDOW 'real' 'real' 'real' 'real' ! define area of triangulation
  ZLIMITS 'real' 'real'              ! specifies the Z-range of the data
  MAXPOINTS 'integer'                ! specifies approx. number of points
  FILEOUT 'file-spec'                ! create and open output files 
  FILEIN  'file-spec'                ! input data (default IFF)
  GO                                 ! triangulate it


            This  set  of  commands  is  sufficient  to  produce  a  triangulation
            containing  no  breaklines or geomorphological feature tagging.  Input
            is to be all the data from a single IFF file  that  falls  within  the
            specified window.

            The exact sequence given above is not rigidly enforced.  The only hard
            and fast rules are that WINDOW, MAXPOINTS, ZLIMITS, FILEIN and FILEOUT
            must come before GO and that the other commands come,  in  any  order,
            before FILEIN.

  TRIANG offers the facility of command input from an indirect command file.   The
  '@'  character preceding a file-spec will cause TRIANG to open and read commands
  from the specified file until:

       1.  a  RETURN  command  is  detected  and  command  input  is  returned  to
           SYS$COMMAND.

       2.  a GO command is detected - after completion of the triangulation TRIANG
           exits.

       3.  end-of-file is detected.  This provokes an error  message  and  command
           input is returned to SYS$COMMAND.


  Nested command files are not supported (i.e.  a command file containing  an  '@'
  command),  although  sequential  '@'  commands  are  supported  when  read  from
  SYS$COMMAND.

  As an aid to batch log interpretation TRIANG will echo all commands read from an
  indirect command file.

  ASSIGN  CLIFF_FC  command  enables  the user to specify the feature codes of IFF
  features which are to be treated as cliffs when included in the triangulation.

  For information about digitising and the internal treatment of  clifflines,  see
  the main Description section above.

  By default no feature codes are assigned for breaklines, rivers etc. and all IFF
  data  that  lie  within  the  WINDOW  bounds  are included in the triangulation.
  Explicit IFF layer or feature codes may be removed from a assignment list by use
  of the appropriate DEASSIGN command.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status
  by  an  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  9 command, all features with FC 9 will be excluded
  from input if the user has specified a DESELECT_FC  9  command.   Use  the  SHOW
  SELECTIONS  command to examine current input selections and the SHOW ASSIGNMENTS
  command to examine current assignments.

  On program statup a DATUM default value of 0.0 is assumed.

  Height information within a single IFF file may be stored relative to  different
  height  data  providing that the features pertaining to each height datum can be
  distinguished by feature code or layer.  The DATUM command can be  used  to  set
  the height datum for a subsequent FILEIN command.  If required a single IFF file
  may be read in many times relative to different height data,  feature  selection
  being achieved by SELECT FC and SELECT LAYER commands.

  If the DATUM command is specified prior to reading a DTI file (using the  FORMAT
  DTI  and  FILEIN  commands), the datum change is applied to all posts within the
  DTI file.

  If the INVERSE command has been used to specify height inversion the heights are
  inverted before the datum value is added.

  The DEASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC command complements the ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  command.
  DEASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  enables  the user to remove specified feature codes from
  the list of  feature  codes  that  have  been  assigned  for  interpretation  as
  breaklines.

  By default no feature codes are assigned for breaklines, rivers etc. and all IFF
  data that lie within the WINDOW bounds are included in the triangulation.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status
  by  an  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  9 command, all features with FC 9 will be excluded
  from input if the user has specified a DESELECT_FC  9  command.   Use  the  SHOW

          An IFF feature code which must lie in the range 0  to  32767.   Multiple
          feature codes may be specified separated by commas or spaces.  Ranges of
          feature codes may be specified by separating the range  start  and  stop
          values  by  a colon e.g.  DESELECT FC 2:6 will result in the deselection
          of feature codes 2,3,4,5 and 6.

          If an FRT file has been read into TRIANG any valid  feature  code  group
          names may be used as arguments to the DESELECT FC command.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The DESELECT FC command complements the SELECT FC command.  DESELECT FC  enables
  the  user  to  prevent  TRIANG  from  reading in any IFF features which have the
  specified feature codes.

  On program startup all FCs are selected for input.

  Specific FC selections may then be made with the SELECT FC  command.   Only  the
  specified  FCs  will  be  used for input.  All FCs not explicitly specified in a
  SELECT FC command will be then excluded from input.

  ALL FC and layer selections are cancelled by the SELECT ALL command;  i.e.   all
  layers and FCs are reselected for input.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  TRIANG always seeks  to  produce  a  Delaunay  triangulation.   Unfortunately  a
  triangulation which fits the Delaunay ideal may not necessarily honour the paths
  of the  string  input  from  IFF  file.   The  constraint  option  ensures  that
  triangulation never cuts through through any string features.

  The CONSTRAINT option is applied by default and must be explicitly disabled with
  the  DISABLE  CONSTRAINT  command  if  an  unmodified  Delaunay triangulation is
  required.

  The current status of the CONSTRAINT option  can  be  examined  using  the  SHOW
  ENABLE command.

  By default TRIANG checks that the control points in an IFF input file are square
  to  the map coordinate system.  If the map held in the IFF file is not square to
  the coordinate system axes there is a danger that some rows or  columns  of  the
  DTM  will  be missed out or be incomplete as DTMCREATE uses only axis minima and
  maxima to define the model area.  If the IFF control point values are not square
  and  the  SQUARE  option  is  active then an error message is issued and the run
  aborted.

  The DISABLE SQUARE command disables the squaring test for IFF control points.

  The current status of the SQUARE option can be examined using  the  SHOW  ENABLE
  command.

  It is possible that different input files may have heights recorded in different
  measurement systems.  The model must be relative to one system only.  Two preset
  height conversion options are available:  ENABLE TOMETRES and ENABLE TOFEET.

  The ENABLE TOFEET command enables the conversion of heights held in the IFF file
  in  metres  to  feet.   It  has the same effect as an explicit ENABLE MULTIPLYBY
  3.2808455 command.  It is possible to read in one file with heights in feet with
  one  FILEIN  command  and then use the ENABLE TOFEET command and read in another
  file with heights in metres converting to feet during  read-in.   The  DTM  will
  then be produced in feet.

  If one of the height modification options is enabled  using  ENABLE  MULTIPLYBY,
  ENABLE  TOFEET  etc., you must give the ZLIMITS in the target measurement system
  or height range (ie feet for the ENABLE TOFEET command).  Failure to do this may
  result in flattening of all model relief!.

  N.B.  DISABLE TOFEET will not cancel an  explicit  ENABLE  MULTIPLYBY  3.2808455

  The current status of the TOFEET option can be examined using the SHOW ENABLE or

  triangulation which fits the Delaunay ideal may not necessarily honour the paths
  of the  string  input  from  IFF  file.   The  constraint  option  ensures  that
  triangulation never cuts through through any string features.

  The CONSTRAINT option is applied by default and must be explicitly disabled with

  required.

  ENABLE DIAGNOSTICS allows the user to enable diagnostic printout.

  Because it is usually used in a batch processing environment, by default  TRIANG
  produces  minimal  diagnostic  printout.  If however, the user wishes to receive
  indications of processing progress and of the effect of input  data  assignments
  and  selections  on  data  input,  diagnostic  printout may be selected with the
  ENABLE DIAGNOSTICS command.

  It should  be  noted  that  if  DIAGNOSTICS  are  enabled,  TRIANG  can  produce
  voluminous  printout, particularly if used during the input phase in conjunction
  with selections from IFF files.

  On a heavily loaded computer it may be reassuring to ENABLE DIAGNOSTICS for  the
  triangulation  stage  of TRIANG processing to indicate progress through the data
  set.  If SYS$OUTPUT is directed to a video screen terminal, messages  indicating
  percentage progress are issued.

  The current status of the DIAGNOSTICS option can  be  examined  using  the  SHOW
  ENABLE command.

  Incoming IFF heights may be inverted if the ENABLE INVERSE command is  specified
  prior  to  reading an IFF file with a FILEIN command.  This enables modelling of
  hydrographic data where sea depths are often stored as positive heights,  drying
  zone heights as negative and land heights as positive!

  By default heights are not inverted.

  If the DATUM command has been used to specify  a  change  of  height  datum  the
  heights are inverted before the datum value is added.

  The current status of the INVERSE option can be examined using the  SHOW  ENABLE
  or SHOW HEIGHTS commands.

  By default TRIANG checks that the control points in an IFF input file are square
  to  the map coordinate system.  If the map held in the IFF file is not square to
  the coordinate system axes there is a danger that some rows or  columns  of  the
  DTM  will  be missed out or be incomplete as DTMCREATE uses only axis minima and
  maxima to define the model area.  If the IFF control point values are not square
  and  the  SQUARE  option  is  active then an error message is issued and the run
  aborted.

  The ENABLE SQUARE command enables the squaring test for IFF control points.

  The current status of the SQUARE option can be examined using  the  SHOW  ENABLE
  command.

  If one of the height modification options is enabled  using  ENABLE  MULTIPLYBY,

          themselves provide the default filename  and  extension  fields  of  the
          specification.    For  example,  a  valid  definition  of  logical  name
          LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK is:

          $ DEFINE LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.DTMCREATE]

          This mechanism allows all DTMCREATE triangulation files to be stored  in
          a  central  directory,  rather  than  scattered  in  many different user
          directories.  It thus mimics the use of logical  names  LSL$IF  for  IFF
          files and LSL$DTI for DTI files.

          If the logical name is not defined,  any  parts  of  the  file-spec  not
          supplied  for  the  FILEOUT  command  will  be  taken  from the defaults
          'SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0' and 'SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0'.  These defaults  result  in
          the  output  files  being created in your current default directory, set
          using the VMS SET DEFAULT or Laser-Scan SD commands.

  When all necessary files have been read in the  GO  command  will  commence  the
  triangulation process.  Unless relatively small data-sets are being handled (say
  less then 50,000 data points) it is strongly recommended that TRIANG is  run  in
  batch mode at an off-peak time.

  The  GO  command  will  cause  TRIANG  to  first  produce  an   ideal   Delaunay
  triangulation.   If  the CONSTRAINT option is enabled TRIANG will then constrain
  the idealised triangulation to the  paths  of  input  data  strings.   When  all
  triangulation  creation  and modification is complete TRIANG writes out the data
  structure to binary disk files and then exits.

  MAXPOINTS

     The value supplied for the MAXPOINTS command determines the  dimensioning  of
     TRIANG  internal  workspace  and the number of imaginary points placed around
     the edge of the triangulation.  It is very likely that  the  user  will  have
     only  a  very  rough  idea  of  the amount of data expected within the window
     defined using the WINDOW command.  This does  not  matter  as  only  a  rough
     estimate  is needed.  If ludicrously few points are estimated, say 10% of the
     actual data-set, then program running times will be  significantly  increased
     because  the  box  data structure will not accurately reflect changes in data
     density.  A rough figure, say 80% accurate, is better than nothing.

     The number of points specified using the MAXPOINTS command must  reflect  the
     total  from  [1mALL[0m  the  files input using FILEIN commands which lie within the
     triangulation window specified using the WINDOW command.

     To calculate the number of points extracted from a  DTI  file  determine  how
     much  of  the DTI files lies within the TRIANG window, divide this by the DTI
     file x or y grid step as appropriate then multiply the  resulting  number  of
     row and columns together.  The DTI file size, coverage and x and y grid steps
     and Z-range may be simply determined by reading the file into MATRIX  utility
     DTIEDIT.

     The IMP utility IINFO can be used to determine  how  many  points  there  are
     within  an  IFF  file,  in  total,  by feature code and by layer.  It cannot,
     however, reveal the number of points that lie within a subwindow of the whole
     IFF  file.   The Z range of the IFF file may be determined using the same run
     of IINFO if the /HEIGHT qualifier is specified.

     If there are more than the permitted number of points within the window  then
     a smaller WINDOW should be specified and the data triangulated in two or more
     separate triangulations.  Allow a small amount of  overlap  between  adjacent
     windows,  the  sub-DTMs created by TRIGRID from these separate triangulations
     will then perfectly edge match when  joined  together  using  MATRIX  utility

          An IFF feature code which must lie in the range 0  to  32767.   Multiple
          feature codes may be specified separated by commas or spaces.  Ranges of
          feature codes may be specified by separating the range  start  and  stop
          values  by  a  colon e.g.  SELECT FC 2:6 will result in the selection of
          feature codes 2,3,4,5 and 6.

          If an FRT file has been read into TRIANG any valid  feature  code  group
          names may be used as arguments to the SELECT FC command.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The SELECT FC command complements the DESELECT FC command.   SELECT  FC  enables
  the user to select any IFF features which have the specified feature codes.

  On program startup all FCs are selected for input.  IFF features which  are  not
  required  for input must be specifically excluded using the appropriate DESELECT
  FC and DESELECT LAYER commands.  For example, the command DESELECT FC 0:7 11:300
  302:32767 will leave only features with FCs 8,9,10, and 301 selected for input.

  The first SELECT FC command has the effect of deselecting  all  FCs  from  input
  except  those  explicitly  specified  as the arguments to the SELECT FC command.
  Subsequent SELECT FC commands have the effect of adding the specified FCs to the
  list of FCs selected for input.

  All layers and FCs may be reselected for input  by  specifying  the  SELECT  ALL
  command.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status
  by  an  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  9 command, all features with FC 9 will be excluded
  from input if the user has specified a DESELECT_FC  9  command.   Use  the  SHOW
  SELECTIONS  command to examine current input selections and the SHOW ASSIGNMENTS
  command to examine current assignments.

  layer

          An IFF layer number must lie in the range 0 to 32767.   Multiple  layers
          may be specified separated by commas or spaces.  Ranges of layers may be
          specified by separating the range start and stop values by a colon  e.g.
          SELECT LAYER 2:6 will result in the selection of layers 2,3,4,5 and 6.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The SELECT LAYER command complements the DESELECT LAYER command.   SELECT  LAYER
  enables  the  user  to  select  any  IFF features which are contained within the
  specified layers.

  By default TRIANG will input all features within an IFF file, regardless of  the
  layer in which they lie.

  On program startup all layers are selected for input.  IFF  features  which  are
  not  required  for  input  must  be  specifically excluded using the appropriate
  DESELECT FC and DESELECT LAYER commands.   For  example,  the  command  DESELECT
  LAYER  0:7  11:300  302:32767  will  leave only features which lie within layers
  8,9,10, and 301 selected for input.

  The first SELECT LAYER command has the effect of  deselecting  all  layers  from
  input  except  those  explicitly  specified as the arguments to the SELECT LAYER
  command.  Subsequent SELECT  LAYER  commands  have  the  effect  of  adding  the
  specified layers to the list of FCs selected for input.

  All layers and FCs may be reselected for input  by  specifying  the  SELECT  ALL
  command.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status
  by  an  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  9 command, all features with FC 9 will be excluded
  from input if the user has specified a DESELECT_FC  9  command.   Use  the  SHOW
  SELECTIONS  command to examine current input selections and the SHOW ASSIGNMENTS
  command to examine current assignments.

  Shows current triangulation window values.

  The units of the WINDOW command parameters are set using the UNITS command.   By
  default metre units are assumed.  If it is more convenient to specify the window
  in latitude and longitude the sexagesimal lat long values may be supplied  after
  specifying a UNITS LATLONG command.  This assumes that the data read in from the
  DTI and IFF files are in units of tenths second of arc.  A similar assumption is
  made for UNITS SECONDS.

  The SHOW WINDOW command displays  the  window  values  in  the  units  currently
  selected  by  the  UNITS command.  No projection transformation is performed, so
  the unwise user could easily specify  that  the  window  be  shown  as  latitude
  longitude despite the fact that his data are in metres!

  If UNITS SECONDS or UNITS LATLONG are used it is assumed that the data  read  in
  using FILEIN commands are in units of tenth seconds of arc.

  UNITS METRES (the default) or UNITS PROJECTION assume that the the data read  in
  using FILEIN commands are in metres or projection units.  In a future release of
  DTMCREATE coordinate consistency checks between input files will be implemented.

  Currently the projection information for the first input file read with a FILEIN
  command  is  copied  to  the  .NOD  and  .DTA output files for subsequent use in
  setting up the header of the LSLA type DTI file created in TRIGRID.

  xmax ymax

          The coordinates of the top right hand corner of the defining  rectangle,
          (including any IFF origin offset values).

  The units of the WINDOW command parameters are set using the UNITS command.   By
  default metre units are assumed.  If it is more convenient to specify the window
  in latitude and longitude the sexagesimal lat long values may be supplied  after
  specifying a UNITS LATLONG command.  This assumes that the data read in from the
  DTI and IFF files are in units of tenths second of arc.  A similar assumption is
  made for UNITS SECONDS.

  Remember that the WINDOW parameters must be specified in the order  SW  latitude
  longitude,  NE  latitude  longitude  if  using  latlong  units,  (i.e.   x and y
  specification is reversed).

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The command is used to define rectangular limits to  the  area  of  data  to  be
  included  within  the  triangulation.  The limits must be specified in the order
  bottom left hand (or south west) corner then top  right  hand  (or  north  east)
  corner.

  WINDOW command parameters must be expressed in absolute coordinate  space  (i.e.
  including the origin offset), not local map coordinate space (which excludes the
  origin offset).  Only by doing this will the correct  data  clipping  limits  be
  applied to IFF and DTI data coming from different source files.

  The WINDOW command can be used to clip data from input IFF or DTI files.

  The WINDOW command is obligatory.

  The rectangular limits set by the WINDOW command cannot be reset once  a  FILEIN
  command  has  been  issued as the WINDOW command arguments are used to determine
  scaling between DTMCREATE internal workspace coordinates and map units.

  [1mDescription:[0m

  All data is scaled by TRIANG to an internal common form.  Until all the required
  IFF and DTI files have been read in the full range of the Z-variable is unknown.
  The ZLIMITS command allows the user to specify the Z-variable range  before  any
  IFF  files  are  read.  The values that the user supplies are used to set up the
  Z-scaling.  The ZLIMITS command requires only a rough indication of the expected
  minimum  and  maximum  Z values.  It is important to remember though, that the Z
  range specified should represent not only that of the first data set but also of
  any  subsequent  IFF files.  The Z range should also reflect any later grid that
  may be interpolated allowing for any expected highs or lows outside the possible
  data range.

  [1mIMPORTANT[0m If one of the height modification  options  is  enabled  using  ENABLE
  MULTIPLYBY,  ENABLE  TOFEET  etc.,  you  must  give  the  ZLIMITS  in the target
  measurement system or height range (ie feet for the TOFEET command).  Failure to
  do this may result in flattening of all model relief!

  EXAMPLES                                                         12 October 1992


            In this example TRIANG has been used to create a constrained  Delaunay
            triangulation  of  a subset of data windowed out of a single IFF input
            file.  For the purposes  of  explanation  the  diagnostics  have  been
            enabled,  resulting in voluminous printout.  The user has used copious
            comments in the command lines to tell us  what  he  was  doing.   Such
            comments  are  extremely  useful  when  writing command files to drive
            TRIANG in a batch processing environment, as the comments make it much
            easier  to work out what is going on when processing problems arise or
            the command file has to be modified months after its creation.

            Examination of the example printout shows that the user  has  set  the
            MAXPOINTS  argument  to  4000  points.  This value has been derived by
            using the IMP (IFF Map Processing) package module IINFO and as we  are
            taking  a  windowed  subset  of  the  data,  an  educated  guess.  The
            MAXPOINTS value has only to  be  around  80%  accurate  for  perfectly
            adequate allocation of TRIANG internal workspace.

            The user has then used the ZLIMITS command to set the Z limits for the
            incoming  data.   Until  all  the required IFF data have been read the
            full range of the Z-variable is unknown.  The  values  that  the  user
            supplies  are  used to set up the TRIANG internal Z-scaling.  Like the
            MAXPOINTS  command,  the  ZLIMITS  command  requires  only   a   rough
            indication  of  the  expected  minimum  and  maximum  values.   It  is
            important to remember, though,  that  the  Z  range  specified  should
            represent  not  only  that  of  the  first  data  set  but also of any
            subsequent IFF files.  The Z range should also reflect any later  grid
            that  may  be  interpolated  allowing  for  any expected highs or lows
            outside the possible data range.  In this example the  user  has  used
            the  IMP  IINFO  utility  with  the  /HEIGHT_RANGE  qualifier  set  to
            determine the Z minima and maxima in  the  file.   To  allow  for  any
            interpolation  undershoot  or  overshoot,  it is good practice to then
            extend the Z limits by one contour interval top and bottom.

            The user has next specified the rectangular WINDOW which defines  that
            portion of the data that is to be extracted from the IFF file and used
            for the triangulation.  From the discussion of the diagnostic printout
            below, it is evident that the user has used the WINDOW command to clip
            out a comparatively small part of the whole data set.

            In this simple example, input has been taken from only one  IFF  file.
            In  more  complex  processing cases, where input is taken from several
            IFF and DTI files, it is important to remember that the WINDOW command
            arguments  must  reflect the data range for the desired triangulation,
            not just the coverage of the input file that happens to be read first.

            Presumably for reassurance, the user has given the SHOW WINDOW command
            immediately  after  the  WINDOW command.  SHOW WINDOW caused TRIANG to
            print out the newly defined window bounds.

            Satisfied with the window, the  user  has  proceeded  to  specify  the
            generic  file  specification  to  be used for the binary output files.
            All components of the supplied file-spec are used to form  the  output
            file  specifications  but with the substitution of the extensions .NOD
            and .DTA.  Any parts of the file-spec not  supplied  for  the  FILEOUT
            command   are   taken   from   the  defaults  'SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0'  and
            'SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0'.     This    indicates    that    logical     name

  EXAMPLES                                                         12 October 1992


            LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK  is not currently defined, the missing parts of the
            file file-spec being taken from the user's current default device  and
            directory.   (For  details  of  the  use  of this logical name see the
            FILEOUT command above).  These defaults result  in  the  output  files
            being created in your current default directory, set using the VMS SET
            DEFAULT or Laser-Scan SD commands.  For reassurance  TRIANG  issues  a
            message as the output files are successfully created and opened.

            The next command issued is the  SHOW  ENABLE  command.   The  printout
            produced  by  this  command  will tell the user all the current option
            settings.  The SHOW SELECTIONS command is used to  give  feature  code
            and  layer  selection  defaults.  It is evident that at the start of a
            TRIANG run there are no feature code or  layer  selections  set.   The
            SHOW  ENABLE  command can be issued at any time to a TRIANG> prompt to
            display the current command settings.

            Because it is usually used  in  a  batch  processing  environment,  by
            default  TRIANG produces minimal diagnostic printout.  In this example
            the user wishes to receive indications of processing progress  and  of
            the  effect  of selections on data input and so has enabled diagnostic
            printout using the ENABLE DIAGNOSTICS command.

            From this example it is  obvious  that  if  DIAGNOSTICS  are  enabled,
            TRIANG  can  produce  voluminous printout, particularly if used during
            the input phase associated with FILEIN commands.   It  is  recommended
            that in a batch processing production environment, diagnostic printout
            is suppressed.

            The user  next  supplied  feature  code  assignments  for  breaklines,
            ridgelines  and  rivers by specifying feature code arguments to ASSIGN
            sub-commands.  Notice the use of comments and also the use of  feature
            code ranges, which save a lot of typing!

            The user has supplied a comment telling us that  are  some  road  data
            present  in  layer  16  of  the  IFF  file which are not wanted in the
            triangulation.  It is quite common for data unsuitable for use as  DTM
            control  to  be mixed up with the required heighted information.  Here
            the user knows that all the road data are isolated in layer 16 and has
            issued the DESELECT LAYER 16 command to prevent TRIANG from reading in
            any data from that layer.  It would similarly have  been  possible  to
            have  used  the  DESELECT  FC  command  with  appropriate feature code
            arguments to perform the same task if the road data were  more  simply
            differentiated by feature code.

            It is important to remember that the DESELECT LAYER  and  DESELECT  FC
            commands  are  very powerful and will override any assignments made on
            the same layers and feature codes.   This  will  cause  features  with
            those  assignments to be excluded from the triangulation, even if, for
            example, the user has already assigned  them  to  breaklines.   It  is
            therefore  of  the  utmost  importance to check feature code and layer
            selections  and  deselections  most  carefully  to  ensure  that  such
            assignment conflicts do not arise.

            Very sensibly the user has next issued a SHOW SELECTIONS  and  a  SHOW
            ASSIGNMENTS command so that a check for selection clashes can be made.

  EXAMPLES                                                         12 October 1992


            Satisfied with the selections made,  the  user  has  issued  a  FILEIN
            command  to  open  and read data from the specified input file.  As no
            FORMAT DTI command has been issued, TRIANG assumes that input is  from
            an IFF file.  Those parts of the file-spec not supplied for the FILEIN
            command   are   taken   from   the    default    file    specification
            'LSL$IF:IFF.IFF;0'.   The file is successfully opened and a reassuring
            message output.

            Because diagnostic printout has been enabled, TRIANG announces that it
            is  starting  a  pass  through  the  IFF  file and proceeds to issue a
            diagnostic message for every IFF feature  read  from  the  file.   The
            message  "'integer'  points  retained out of 'integer' in feature with
            FSN 'integer' ('integer')" tells the  user  how  much  data  is  being
            rejected due to:

             o  points lying too close together,

             o  points within the string lying outside of the WINDOW limits.


            It is evident that a large number of features lie entirely outside the
            WINDOW limits as all their points are rejected.

            Near the end of input from the IFF file TRIANG has issued four warning
            messages.   The  features  lack  a  type 3 (real height) AC (Ancillary
            Code) and are ignored - i.e.  omitted  from  the  triangulation.   The
            user  appears to be happy with this situation judging from the comment
            supplied.

            What is more disturbing is that the user has specified  feature  codes
            for  breaklines,  ridgelines  and  rivers,  but  TRIANG  has issued no
            diagnostics to indicate  that  such  features  have  been  found.   If
            diagnostic  printout  is  enabled,  TRIANG will always issue a message
            each time a cliff, breakline, ridge or river feature is read.

            The user seems to be content with this  situation,  however,  and  has
            proceeded   to   issue  the  GO  command  which  starts  the  Delaunay
            triangulation process.

            A message is output to indicate  the  progress  of  the  triangulation
            process  at  5%  intervals.   As  only  1081  points  lie  within  the
            triangulation WINDOW the triangulation takes little  time.   When  the
            triangulation  is  complete a message is output to indicate that there
            are now 1205 points in the triangulation area as 124 imaginary  points
            have been generated around the edge of the triangulation.

            As no DISABLE CONSTRAINT command has been issued  TRIANG  proceeds  to
            constrain  the  Delaunay  triangulation  to the paths of the input IFF
            strings.  To do this a random access node/neighbour list has to be set
            up  in  memory,  and  if  the  data set is very large, a random access
            scratch file is set up on disk.  If a big dataset is being constrained
            this  setup  may  take  some  time  and  so  messages are output at 5%
            intervals to indicate progress.

            Triangulation constraint is conducted first on breaklines, which  must
            always  override  other string features in the data structure for they
            define lines of slope discontinuity.  Next contours, ridge  and  river
            strings  are  constrained.   Finally  the  nodes  are  reorganised  in
            workspace to reflect the new string  patterns,  and  then  any  string
            patches  are  inserted  into  strings  broken by the original Delaunay
            triangulation.  The progress of each of these stages is  indicated  at
            5% intervals.

            Finally the reorganised, constrained triangulation is written  to  the
            two binary output files opened using the FILEOUT command.

            The run has completed successfully and DCL symbol $STATUS  is  set  to
            SS$_NORMAL, normal successful completion.

            The two binary output files are ready for use  by  TRIDER,  the  slope
            derivative  estimator,  or  TRIEDIT,  the  triangulation editor (which
            could be used to insert the missing  river,  ridgeline  and  breakline
            strings).

  NOV2MD, IFF map descriptor in %S is not version 2

      [1mExplanation:[0m  TRIANG expects input files to have type 2 map  descriptors  as
      it  offers  offset  merging  functionality  based on the contents of the map
      descriptor.  TRIANG is downwards compatible with old pattern IFF files which
      have  type 1 map descriptors, but no origin offset facility is supported for
      the earlier pattern files.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  If origin offsetting  is  required  use  ITRANS/DESCRIPTOR  to
      create a copy of the IFF file having a type 2 map descriptor.

  These messages indicate an error in processing which will cause the  program  to

  OPNSCR, error opening scratch file SYS$DISK:[]TRIANG.TMP;

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The data set read in has exceeded the  current  TRIANG  memory
      quota  and  a  random access disk file was going to be opened to contain the
      surplus.  However, TRIANG has failed to open this random access file.

  SQRCP, file control points are not square

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The IFF file which you are reading in has control points which
      are  not  square to their coordinate system axes.  This may lead to problems
      of edge matching between DTMs at the DTITILE stage and may lead to lost data
      on input to TRIANG due to edge clipping.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Check that the IFF control points are meant to be  non-square.
      If they are and the dangers of modelling with data in relative to non-square

      disables with the DISABLE SQUARE command.

  STACKOVR, stack overflow - triangulation will be destroyed

      [1mExplanation:[0m  When in constraint mode TRIANG has only  a  finite  amount  of
      space available to store all the new points that have been inserted into the
      data structure.  You have now used up all this space and TRIANG will have to
      give  up, losing the triangulation in the process.  It is very unlikely that
      you will get this message as a minimum of 33% of workspace is  reserved  for
      storage  of points generated during constraint.  The data supplied to TRIANG
      must have been very poorly distributed to have caused this failure.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,

  introduced by '%DTILIB' and are  documented  in  the  MATRIX  package  reference

            TRIDER takes the triangulation node and data files created  by  TRIANG
            (or edited output from TRIEDIT) and produces an output file containing
            slope derivatives at each data point in the triangulation.  These data
            may  then  be  used  by  TRIGRID in conjunction with the node and data
            files as the basis for DTM grid estimation.  Once TRIDER has been used
            to  generate  a  slope derivative file many subsequent runs of TRIGRID
            may be made to produce DTM grids at differing resolutions.

            TRIDER always works on the whole area defined within the triangulation
            files.   It  is not possible to specify a subset of the data for slope
            estimation.  This is to allow continuity of slope estimation  in  edge
            areas which may otherwise be impaired if the data area is segmented.

            TRIDER expects as input the binary structured data files (the  matched

            produces an output file containing the slope derivatives estimated for
            each data point contained in the triangulation.

  DESCRIPTION                                                      12 October 1992


            The TRIDER input file specification is used as a generic file-spec for
            both  input  (.NOD  and  .DTA)  files and as the source for the TRIDER
            output file specification.

            Any parts missing from the generic file-specification are  taken  from
            the defaults SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0 and SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0.

            The specification of the output file has the  same  device,  directory
            filename  and  version  number  as  the  input  files but is given the
            extension .DER.

            Since it is essential that the file version numbers of the .NOD,  .DTA
            and  .DER  file  always match, TRIGRID performs checks on file version
            numbers.   If  mismatches  are  found,  TRIDER  complains  and  aborts
            execution.

            Never use the VAX/VMS RENAME or COPY commands  to  alter  the  version
            numbers  of .NOD, .DTA files or .DER files to make them into a matched
            set.  TRIDER will have to be rerun every time that the .NOD  and  .DTA
            files are modified using TRIEDIT.

            The output files from TRIANG will be scaled to lie between 0  and  the
            value  defined  by logical, LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION, or 300000 if the
            logical is not defined.   The  valid  range  for  this  resolution  is
            between 300000 and 10000000.

            TRIDER uses this logical value to determine the internal resolution of
            the .NOD and .DTA files.

                                          IMPORTANT

                    It is  therefore  essential  that  the  logical  value
                    LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION  remains  the same when going
                    from TRIANG all  the  way  through  to  TRIGRID  on  a
                    particular  dataset.   If  the  resolution  is altered
                    between any of the stages, unpredictable results  will
                    occur and programs may fail.

            Beyond the edge of the triangulation there lies the abyss where  there
            are  no  heights to control the form of the surface.  Obviously if the
            user wishes to make full use of the triangulated area by  gridding  up
            to  the very edges, some sensible estimate must be made of the surface
            beyond the actual data limits.  The imaginary point frame  created  by
            TRIANG  helps  to remove uncertainty by providing a cosmetic solution.
            The imaginary points have location but no Z value.

            [1mIntroduction[0m

            One of the functions  of  TRIDER  is  to  provide  Z  values  for  the
            imaginary  points  generated  around  the edge of the triangulation by
            TRIANG.  Four interpolation options are available for imaginary  point
            estimation:

             o  FIXED - force all imaginary points to take the same  fixed  height
                value

             o  TREND - (default) - estimate imaginary point heights from a  trend
                surface

                Interpolation options:

             o  BOX - interpolate height from nodes obtained using  expanding  box
                search

             o  SHELL/NEIGHBOUR -  interpolate  height  from  nodes  in  expanding
                shells of neighbours


            Limits may be set  to  the  interpolation  process  used  to  estimate
            heights  for  the imaginary points which allow upper and lower Z value
            range clipping.  This facility may be used, for  example,  in  coastal
            areas to ensure that no imaginary point Z value is allowed to go below
            sea level, ie 0.0.

            The fixed option assumes that the user wishes the surface  to  decline
            to  some  fixed  value all the way around the edge of the triangulated
            area at some distance (yet  to  be  determined)  from  the  main  grid
            coverage.  By using the FIXED option the user can specify the value to
            be  used  for  the  imaginary  point  Z  values.   TRIDER  will   then
            automatically  insert  this value at all imaginary point locations and
            will also insert zero partial derivatives at  each  of  the  imaginary
            points.   This will have the effect of making the surface flatten to a
            plane by the time that the imaginary points are reached.   This  plane
            will be horizontal because the derivatives have been set to zero.

            Quite often the user will not have any idea what individual values  to
            give  the imaginary points but will know that he does not want a fixed
            horizontal plane at  the  edge  of  his  data.   The  second  (startup
            default)  solution  therefore is to assign the values of the imaginary
            points to be those calculated  from  a  linear  trend  surface  fitted
            through   all   the  data  points  in  the  interpolation  area.   The
            derivatives assigned to  the  imaginary  points  will  then  be  those
            partial  derivatives estimated for the plane itself.  Thus if the data

            set has a definite trend (for instance increasing  in  height  to  the
            south  west)  this  option  would  produce  an equivalent trend in the
            heights of the imaginary points.

            There are two alternative options  for  the  estimation  of  imaginary
            point values based on "reasonably" close data points.

             o  BOX

             o  SHELL/NEIGHBOUR


            Four  interpolation  techniques  are   offered   for   the   BOX   and
            SHELL/NEIGHBOUR interpolation options:

            1.  Unweighted,

            2.  linear,

            3.  quadratic, or,

            4.  quartic.


             o  IMAGINARY  BOX  -  This  option  performs  a   distance   weighted
                interpolation  based on points discovered by means of an expanding
                hollow box search.  The box search is in turn based around the box
                structure  generated  by  TRIANG.   The interpolation is formed by
                standard  methods.   The  box  size  expands  automatically  until
                sufficient  points  have been discovered.  This method is probably
                most applicable to genuinely  variable  data  of  the  seismic  or
                non-contour  type.  If spot heights form a large proportion of the
                data set or any other irregularly distributed data  is  used,  the
                box  option should be chosen as it will provide a very smooth edge
                around the data area.

             o  IMAGINARY SHELL/NEIGHBOUR -  The  method  of  collection  of  data
                points  employed is that of successively finding the neighbours of
                the  point  in  question  by  running   through   the   triangular
                node/neighbour data structure created by program TRIANG and stored
                in a file.  The process can be thought of as that  of  picking  up
                points  in  a  series of layers.  Thus the first layer consists of
                the neighbours of the point itself.  The second layer contains the
                neighbours  of  the  neighbours  that  have been picked up but not
                including  any  previously  found  points.   This  process   could
                obviously continue until all data points in the data set have been
                found!

                A height for every imaginary point will then be estimated using  a
                specified  weighting function, using the neighbours that have been
                found.  If an insufficient number  of  real  neighbours  has  been
                found  then  the program will automatically search deeper into the

                data structure.

            All imaginary points are capable of relocation by a factor from 0 to 1
            (the  maximum  grid dimension).  This can be very useful if one wishes
            to produce a grid of a larger area than the triangulation covers.   By
            positioning  the  imaginary  points  out  as  far  as  possible (ie by
            choosing 1) the area of coverage of the triangulation  is  effectively
            extended by a factor of nearly 9.  Of course this does nothing for the
            quality of the  map  as  such  but  does  ensure  that  some  sort  of
            "reasonable"  surface value will be put in these regions that are very
            distant from real data.  If the extension is not sufficiently far then
            default  values  will  be  inserted  into  the grid which can later be
            altered by the user to the default of his choice.

            When the FIXED or TREND options have been chosen  it  is  sensible  to
            locate  the  imaginary points reasonably far away from the edge of the
            grid.  This is necessary to ensure  that  the  surface  has  a  fairly
            flexible  approach  to  reaching the imaginary point values.  In areas
            where the surface is not close to the trend or fixed  value  it  needs
            room  to manoeuvre itself to these values!  If an interpolation option
            has been chosen for the imaginary points then in most cases it will be
            sensible, if not vital, to keep the imaginary points close to the grid
            itself.  This ensures that  the  imaginary  points  are  most  closely
            controlled by those points falling closest to them.

            and  TRIGRID.   The  progress  of imaginary and fixed point derivative
            estimation may then be watched.  The convoluted process  of  imaginary

  TRIDER offers the facility of command input from an indirect command file.   The
  '@'  character preceding a file-spec will cause TRIDER to open and read commands
  from the specified file until:

       1.  a  RETURN  command  is  detected  and  command  input  is  returned  to
           SYS$COMMAND.

       2.  a GO command is detected - after completion  of  derivative  estimation
           TRIDER exits.

       3.  end-of-file is detected.  This provokes an error  message  and  command
           input is returned to SYS$COMMAND.


  Nested command files are not supported (i.e.  a command file containing  an  '@'
  command),  although  sequential  '@'  commands  are  supported  when  read  from
  SYS$COMMAND.

  As an aid to batch log interpretation TRIDER will echo all commands read from an
  indirect command file.

  file-spec

          The generic specification of the .NOD and .DTA files to  be  opened  for
          data input.

          All components of the supplied file-spec are used to form the input file
          specifications but with the substitution of the extensions .NOD and .DTA
          and version number ';0', i.e.  latest version (shared by both files).

          The default file-spec used to  make  up  missing  parts  of  the  FILEIN
          file-spec   parameter  is  dependent  on  the  status  of  logical  name
          LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK.

          If logical  name  LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK  is  defined,  DTMCREATE  utilities
          translate  the  logical  name to get the default file-spec for input and
          output of triangulation files.  The logical name should  be  defined  to
          provide  a  device  and  directory  name  only.   The DTMCREATE programs
          themselves provide the default filename  and  extension  fields  of  the
          specification.    For  example,  a  valid  definition  of  logical  name
          LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK is:

          $ DEFINE LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.DTMCREATE]

          This mechanism allows all DTMCREATE triangulation files to be stored  in
          a  central  directory,  rather  than  scattered  in  many different user
          directories.  It thus mimics the use of logical  names  LSL$IF  for  IFF
          files and LSL$DTI for DTI files.

          If the logical name is not defined,  any  parts  of  the  file-spec  not
          supplied  for  the  FILEIN  command  will  be  taken  from  the defaults
          'SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0' and 'SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0'.  These defaults  result  in
          the  files  being  searched  for  in your current default directory, set
          using the VMS SET DEFAULT or Laser-Scan SD commands.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  TRIDER expects as input the 2 binary structured data files (the matched pair  of
  .NOD  and .DTA files) produced by TRIANG or TRIEDIT.  It produces an output file
  containing the slope derivatives estimated for each data point contained in  the
  triangulation.

  The specification of the output file has the same device, directory filename and
  version number as the input files but is given the extension .DER.

  Since it is essential that the file version numbers of the .NOD, .DTA  and  .DER
  file  always  match,  TRIGRID  performs  checks  on  file  version  numbers.  If
  mismatches are found, TRIDER complains  and  aborts  execution.   Similarly,  an
  error  occurs  if  TRIDER attempts to create a new .DER file which has a version
  number which already exists.

  This imaginary point height  estimation  option  performs  a  distance  weighted
  interpolation  based  on  points  discovered by means of an expanding hollow box
  search.  The box search is in turn based around the box structure  generated  by
  TRIANG.   The interpolation is formed by standard methods.  The box size expands
  automatically until sufficient points have  been  discovered.   This  method  is
  probably  most  applicable  to  genuinely  variable  data  of the seismic or non
  contour type.  If spot heights form a large proportion of the data  set  or  any
  other  irregularly  distributed data is used, the box option should be chosen as
  it will provide a very smooth edge around the data area.

  As an interpolation option has been chosen for the imaginary points then in most

  the grid itself.  This ensures  that  the  imaginary  points  are  most  closely
  controlled  by  those  points  falling  closest to them.  Thus set the imaginary
  point relocation proportion to 0.0 or close to 0.0.

  The fixed option assumes that the user wishes the surface  to  decline  to  some
  fixed  value  all  the  way  around  the  edge  of the triangulated area at some
  distance (yet to be determined) from the main grid coverage.  By using the FIXED
  option  the  user  can  specify  the  value to be used for the imaginary point Z
  values.  TRIDER will then automatically insert this value at all imaginary point
  locations and will also insert zero partial derivatives at each of the imaginary
  points.  This will have the effect of making the surface flatten to a  plane  by
  the  time  that the imaginary points are reached.  This plane will be horizontal
  because the derivatives have been set to zero.

  When the IMAGINARY FIXED  option  is  chosen,  it  is  sensible  to  locate  the
  imaginary  points  reasonably  far  away  from  the  edge  of the grid.  This is
  necessary to ensure that the surface has a fairly flexible approach to  reaching
  the  imaginary  point  values.   In  areas where the surface is not close to the
  fixed value it needs room to manoeuvre itself to these values!

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  IMAGINARY SHELL/NEIGHBOUR - The method of collection of data points employed  is
  that  of successively finding the neighbours of the point in question by running
  through the triangular node/neighbour data structure created by  program  TRIANG
  and  stored  in  a  file.   The  process can be thought of as that of picking up
  points in a series of layers.  Thus the first layer consists of  the  neighbours
  of the point itself.  The second layer contains the neighbours of the neighbours
  that have been picked up but not including any previously  found  points.   This
  process could obviously continue until all data points in the data set have been
  found!

  A height for every imaginary point will then  be  estimated  using  a  specified
  weighting   function,  using  the  neighbours  that  have  been  found.   If  an
  insufficient number of of real neighbours has been found then the  program  will
  automatically search deeper into the data structure.

  If any of the first layer neighbours  contain  points  marked  as  discontinuous
  during  the  initial  data  formation  stage  at  the beginning of TRIANG then a
  further search is made.  This checks whether any  layer  1  adjacent  neighbours
  are:

        o  discontinuous, and,

        o  have the same z value.


  If so then the interpolation point is assigned the same  value  as  these.   The
  reason  for  this  is  that  it  is  quite  possible  that  there  will  be flat
  plateau-like areas on a contour map which should remain flat at the edges  of  a
  map.   Usually,  and hopefully, there will be control points in these flat areas
  at the edges to help the automatic calculation  process  along.   But  sometimes
  this  can  be  difficult  and  hence  this  check for discontinuous points is an
  attempt  to  ensure  locally  that  the  imaginary  points  are  biased  towards
  representing locally flat discontinuous structures.

  Quite often the user will not have any idea what individual values to  give  the
  imaginary points but will know that he does not want a fixed horizontal plane at
  the edge of his data.  The default IMAGINARY option therefore is to  assign  the
  values  of  the  imaginary  points  to  be  those calculated from a linear trend
  surface fitted through all the data  points  in  the  interpolation  area.   The
  derivatives  assigned  to  the  imaginary  points  will  then  be  those partial
  derivatives estimated for the plane itself.  Thus if the data set has a definite
  trend  (for  instance  increasing in height to the south west) this option would
  produce an equivalent trend in the heights of the imaginary points.

  The ZLIMITS command enables the user to  specify  lower  and  upper  ZLIMITS  to
  imaginary  point  height estimation.  If an imaginary point height is calculated
  which falls outside of the specified limits the height will be truncated to  the
  relevant limit.

  By default TRIDER applies no limits to imaginary point height estimation.

  It is not necessary to specify  the  ZLIMITS  command  if  the  IMAGINARY  FIXED
  imaginary point height option is used.

  [1mIMPORTANT[0m If one of the height modification options was selected in TRIANG using
  ENABLE MULTIPLYBY, ENABLE TOFEET etc., you must give the TRIDER ZLIMITS argument
  values in the target measurement system or height range (ie feet if  the  TRIANG
  TOFEET  command  was specified).  Failure to do this may result in flattening of
  all model relief!

            This example shows TRIDER in use  with  the  default  TREND  imaginary
            point  height  estimation  option selected.  TRIDER first reads in all
            nodes and neighbour relationships from  the  matched  pair  of  binary
            files:

                DATA$DISK:[DTMCREATE.TRIANG]TST.DTA;1

                DATA$DISK:[DTMCREATE.TRIANG]TST.NOD;1


            The user has merely specified FILEIN TST, the rest of the  input  file
            specification  components  are  taken from the default SYS$DISK:[].DTA
            and SYS$DISK:[].NOD, i.e.   the  user's  current  default  device  and
            directory.  The file version number is taken from the actual files.

            A binary output file DATA$DISK:[DTMCREATE.TRIANG]TST.NOD;1 is  created
            and opened to receive the slope derivatives.

            After the GO command TRIDER  starts  by  estimating  heights  for  the
            imaginary  points  around  the  edge of the data area.  By default the
            imaginary points are relocated by the  maximum  possible  amount  away
            from  the  existing  edge of the data area.  This is to provide TRIDER
            with maximum leeway when fitting the quintic surface  from  which  the

            slope  derivatives  are  taken.   As  ZLIMITS  were not specified, the
            heights estimated for the imaginary points are not constrained in  any
            way.

            TRIDER then proceeds to fit quintic surface patches  across  the  data
            area wherever possible.  Where the nodes are too poorly distributed or
            simply too few for a high order surface patch  to  be  fitted,  TRIDER
            will  lower  the  order of surface to be fitted and try again.  As the
            slope derivatives for each node are estimated, TRIDER writes  them  to
            the derivative file DATA$DISK:[DTMCREATE.TRIANG]TST.DER;1.

            The run has completed successfully and DCL symbol $STATUS  is  set  to
            SS$_NORMAL, i.e.  normal successful completion.

            This  example  shows  the  SHELLNEIGHBOUR   imaginary   point   height
            estimation option in use.

            After opening the matched pair of binary input files and creating  the
            binary  slope derivative output file, TRIDER estimates heights for the
            imaginary points around the edge of the data area.  In contrast to the
            previous  example,  which  used the default TREND option for imaginary
            point height estimation, the imaginary points are left on the edge  of
            the   existing   data  area  (i.e.   the  imaginary  point  relocation
            proportion is zero).  Shells of neighbours to each imaginary point are
            collected  as  the  basis  for  the interpolation used to estimate the
            imaginary point height.  The  user  has  specified  that  a  quadratic
            (IMAGINARY  SHELLNEIGHBOUR  [1mQUADRATIC[0m)  surface  be fitted through the
            imaginary point's neighbours.

            The ZLIMITS arguments specify minimum and maximum constraints for  the
            heights interpolated for imaginary points.

            TRIDER then proceeds to fit quintic surface patches  across  the  data
            area wherever possible.  Where the nodes are too poorly distributed or
            simply too few for a high order surface patch  to  be  fitted,  TRIDER
            will  lower  the  order of surface to be fitted and try again.  As the
            slope derivatives for each node are estimated, TRIDER writes  them  to
            the derivative file DATA$DISK:[DTMCREATE.TRIANG]QUARRY5.DER;1.

            Attention is drawn to the message warning that  derivative  estimation
            has  failed  for  the  node  at  the  specified  location.  Zero slope
            derivatives are assumed for this node and TRIDER processing continues.
            Such  messages should occur comparatively rarely and reflect instances
            where the data are too poorly distributed (in x,y and z)  to  allow  a
            surface patch to be fitted.

            The run has completed successfully and DCL symbol $STATUS  is  set  to
            SS$_NORMAL, i.e.  normal successful completion.

  INSPTLAY, insufficient points found in layers - abandoning option

      [1mExplanation:[0m   When  the  shell/neighbour  approach   to   imaginary   point
      estimation  is selected, TRIDER goes through the neighbour list, keeping and
      storing in an array as much of it as possible.  This is unlikely to  be  all
      of  it  because  of  lack  of  space  in the array, but must be at least one
      shell's worth to contain all the imaginary points, or an error is  detected.
      Then  for  every  imaginary point in turn TRIDER picks up the real neighbour
      numbers, and assembles them without duplicates in the array.   These  points
      are tagged for derivative estimation, and written out to file for use by the
      interpolation algorithm.  If any imaginary point has no  neighbours  (within
      the  storage  constraints  of  the array) then shell/neighbour estimation is
      abandoned and the box interpolation option is selected.

      distributed  to  perform  the  interpolation.  Unfortunately for the present
      point there are no suitable neighbours in the search box.  NB:  the  use  of
      an   expanding  hollow  square  ensures  that  the  points  nearest  to  the
      interpolation point are included at the head of the list.  This  means  that

            available  on  the  current  terminal  line.   The  default   hardware
            selection may be overridden by the user on the initial TRIEDIT command
            line, or at a later stage while the program is  running  by  means  of
            ENABLE  command  arguments.   A  detailed  description of the hardware
            lookup files and selection  mechanism  is  given  in  the  DESCRIPTION
            section below.

            TRIEDIT may be activated in 3 ways:

            1.  $ [1mTRIEDIT<CR>[0m

                when prompted for a file-spec supply  the  file-spec  only.   This
                will  give  you the default hardware configuration for the current
                terminal line.

            2.  $ [1mTRIEDIT[0m [1mfile-spec<CR>[0m

                This will have the same effect as 1), but will  avoid  the  prompt
                stage.

            3.  $ [1mTRIEDIT[0m [1mfile-spec[0m [1mhardware-option[0m [1m[hardware-option]<CR>[0m

                Where  'hardware-option'  is  a  graphics  hardware  option   (see
                PARAMETERS  below)  This  will  result  in  the  default  hardware
                configuration for the current terminal line being overridden  with
                your explicit selection.

                You must supply the file-spec argument on the command line if  the
                default  graphics  options  are  to  be overriden from the command
                line.

            The TRIEDIT command line decoder is designed to give the user  maximum
            flexibility  with  regard  to the degree of parameter abbreviation and
            the ordering of the parameters.  The only restrictions are:

             o  one of the selected device keywords  must  be  a  graphics  device
                keyword

             o  the file-spec must be the first parameter on the command line

  file-spec

            Specifies the generic (.DTA and .NOD) file-spec that is to be used for
            input.   If  no  file-spec  argument  is supplied on the command line,
            TRIEDIT issues a prompt for the file-spec once the hardware device has
            been initialised:

            .DTA file>

            TRIEDIT expects as input the  2  binary  structured  data  files  (the
            matched  pair  of  .NOD and .DTA files) produced by TRIANG or previous
            TRIEDIT sessions.

            The TRIEDIT input file specification is used as  a  generic  file-spec
            for both input (.NOD and .DTA) files and as the default TRIEDIT output
            file specifications.

            All components of the supplied file-spec are used to  form  the  input
            file  specifications  but with the substitution of the extensions .NOD
            and .DTA and version number ';0', i.e.  latest version (shared by both
            files).

            The default file-spec used to make up missing  parts  of  the  TRIEDIT
            file-spec  parameter  is  dependent  on  the  status  of  logical name
            LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK.

            If logical name LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK  is  defined,  DTMCREATE  utilities
            translate  the logical name to get the default file-spec for input and
            output of triangulation files.  The logical name should be defined  to
            provide  a  device  and  directory  name only.  The DTMCREATE programs
            themselves provide the default filename and extension  fields  of  the
            specification.   For  example,  a  valid  definition  of  logical name
            LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK is:

            $ DEFINE LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.DTMCREATE]

            This mechanism allows all DTMCREATE triangulation files to  be  stored
            in  a  central directory, rather than scattered in many different user
            directories.  It thus mimics the use of logical names LSL$IF  for  IFF
            files and LSL$DTI for DTI files.


  DTMCREATE REFERENCE (1.8): Interactive triangulation editor             Page 6-3
                                                                   12 October 1992


            If the logical name is not defined, any parts  of  the  file-spec  not
            supplied  for  the  FILEIN  command  will  be  taken from the defaults
            'SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0' and 'SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0'.  These defaults result in
            the  files  being  searched for in your current default directory, set
            using the VMS SET DEFAULT or Laser-Scan SD commands.

            Since it is essential that the file version numbers of  the  .NOD  and
            .DTA files match, TRIEDIT performs checks on file version numbers.  If
            the two files don't have the same version  number,  TRIEDIT  complains
            and aborts execution.

            The output files from TRIANG will be scaled to lie between 0  and  the
            value  defined  by logical, LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION, or 300000 if the
            logical is not defined.   The  valid  range  for  this  resolution  is
            between 300000 and 10000000.

            TRIEDIT uses this logical value to determine the  internal  resolution
            of the .NOD and .DTA files.

                                          IMPORTANT

                    It is  therefore  essential  that  the  logical  value
                    LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION  remains  the same when going
                    from TRIANG all  the  way  through  to  TRIGRID  on  a
                    particular  dataset.   If  the  resolution  is altered
                    between any of the stages, unpredictable results  will
                    occur and programs may fail.


  hardware-option

            A hardware option keyword which will be used to override  the  default
            hardware configuration for the current terminal line.

            When such hardware option keywords are specified,  TRIEDIT  checks  in
            another  site  dependent  lookup  file  that  the  desired options are
            available (and are in a valid combination) and  then  initialises  the
            devices accordingly.

            If only one hardware option keyword  is  supplied  it  must  define  a
            graphics  terminal type.  Additional keywords may define GIN (Graphics
            INput) options, e.g.  joysticks, bitpads, etc.

            Some example command lines using these keywords are as follows:



            $ [1mTRIEDIT[0m [1mfilename.DTA[0m [1mWITH[0m [1mA[0m [1mTABLE[0m [1mA[0m [1mS7000[0m [1mAND[0m [1mA[0m [1mVT100<CR>[0m


            This will result in a SIGMA 7000 screen being  used  for  graphics,  a
            VT100 for the command text, and interaction will be via the digitising
            table.


            The same result will be achieved (rather curtly!) by:


            $ [1mTRIEDIT[0m [1mfilename.DTA[0m [1mTA[0m [1mS7[0m [1mVT<CR>[0m

            This will result in both the graphics and the command text being  sent
            to  a  Tektronix  4014.  Unfortunately you have forgotten to specify a
            device for  interaction  with  the  graphics  screen,  which  for  the
            Tektronix  would  have  to  be  thumbwheels  or  a  digitising  table.
            However, once the editing session is in progress  it  is  possible  to
            choose new GIN options with the ENABLE command (see below).

  [1mGeneral[0m

            TRIEDIT can handle supplementary  input  from  IFF  (Internal  Feature
            Format)  files  consisting  of  strings  of contour, seismic, or other
            types of data, marked as either continuous or discontinuous nodes.

            The input data are used to modify a  (possibly  constrained)  Delaunay
            triangulation  produced  by  TRIANG  or  a  previous  TRIEDIT  editing
            session.

            TRIEDIT and TRIANG share common commands for  the  definition  of  IFF
            file  input  options,  such  as  IFF  layer and feature code selection
            options, etc.

            Like TRIANG, TRIEDIT enables the user to apply feature  flags  to  the
            incoming  nodes  to  identify  each  node  as  either  a river node, a
            ridgeline node or an unflagged node.   These  flags  are  used  within
            TRIGRID to control the limits applied to smooth surface interpolation.

            Triangulation input and output from module TRIEDIT is in the  form  of
            two  binary  triangulation  files,  not directly readable by the user.
            These files are  used  to  convey  the  triangulation  data  structure
            between  the various modules of the DTMCREATE package.  The first file
            (input_filename.DTA)  contains  the  data  in  scaled  integer   form,
            together  with  various indices and tables concerning the distribution
            of the data over the triangulation area.  This data set  is  augmented
            by  a  set of imaginary nodes acting as a frame around the edge of the
            map area.  The second  file  (input_filename.NOD)  contains  the  data
            structure  itself  with  a list of the neighbours of each data node in
            the set.

            These triangulation files must always be handled as matched pairs,  as
            the  data  contained  in  one  is the key to the inter-node structures
            described in the other.  If one file is to be deleted then BOTH  files
            must  be deleted.  DTMCREATE modules TRIEDIT, TRIDER and TRIGRID which
            require input from .NOD and .DTA files check that the two files  share
            a common version number and complain if they do not!

            Never use the DCL SET FILE, RENAME  or  COPY  commands  to  alter  the
            version  numbers of mismatched .NOD and .DTA files to make them into a
            matched pair.

            As an alternative  to  using  the  INSERT  command  to  add  new  data
            interactively,  TRIEDIT accepts input of contour and breakline strings
            and spot heights from IFF files.

            TRIEDIT is designed to be compatible with the  "new"  type  IFF  files
            introduced  in  conjunction with the IMP (IFF Map Processing) package.
            The origin offset entry in a type 2 MD (Map Descriptor) entry is  used
            to  offset  coordinate  values  within  an  input  IFF file.  Although
            downwards compatible with "old" type IFF files a  warning  message  is
            issued  if  an  IFF  file is found not to contain a set type 2 MD (Map
            Descriptor) entry.

            Data within IFF files may have string type and feature type attributes
            assigned  within  TRIEDIT  via  the IFF feature code and layer values.
            Commands such as ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC, ASSIGN  RIDGE_LAYER,  etc.   are
            provided  to  make the feature type/code assignments to enable TRIEDIT
            to realize that a  string  is  to  be  stored  as  a  breakline  or  a
            ridgeline, etc.


            [1mHeights[0m

            In IFF files height values are transmitted via AC (Ancillary Code)  or
            ZS  (3D  string) entries.  By default contour and spot height Z values
            are read from type 3 ACs as floating point  values.   By  use  of  the
            ENABLE INTEGER_HEIGHT command, integer heights may be read from type 2
            ACs.

            IFF files are read into TRIEDIT using the FILEIN command.   More  then
            one  input  file  may be specified using a new FILEIN command for each
            file.  Defaults may be changed between reading files.  This means that
            IFF  files  with  different  allocations  of  IFF  entries  for height
            information  or  with  heights  relative  to  different  data  may  be
            combined.

            Height information within a single IFF file may be stored relative  to
            different  height  data providing that the features pertaining to each
            height datum can be distinguished by feature code or layer.  The DATUM
            command  can  be  used to set the height datum for a subsequent FILEIN
            command.  If required a single IFF file may  be  read  in  many  times
            relative to different height data, feature selection being achieved by
            SELECT FC and SELECT LAYER commands.

            Imperial heights may be converted to metric on input with  the  ENABLE
            TOMETRES  command.   The  reverse  is  possible with the ENABLE TOFEET
            command.  Incoming heights may be multiplied  or  divided  by  a  user
            specified  constant  with  the  ENABLE  MULTIPLYBY and ENABLE DIVIDEBY
            commands respectively.

            [1mBREAKLINES[0m

            In order that all surface discontinuities are honoured  in  the  final
            DTM it may be necessary to designate some IFF strings as "breaklines",
            which will ensure a  change  of  slope  character  at  that  line.   A
            breakline  in  the  IFF  file may be identified by its feature code or
            position in a separate layer.  The allocation of IFF feature codes and
            layers  for  breaklines  must  be  input  to  TRIEDIT using the ASSIGN
            BREAKLINE_FC and ASSIGN BREAKLINE_LAYER command respectively.  As with
            the  IFF height storage mechanisms different allocations of layers and
            feature codes for breaklines may be  made  between  successive  FILEIN
            commands.

            IFF files:

             o  The IFF command causes output of the triangulated data to  an  IFF
                file  as 2D and 3D IFF strings.  Wherever possible the IFF strings
                will represent those input for triangulation by TRIANG or  TRIEDIT
                earlier  in  the  flowline.   However, the original strings may be
                broken in  many  places  due  to  the  data  thinning  and  string
                constraint   rules   applied   in   TRIANG  and  as  a  result  of
                supplementary data insertion within TRIEDIT itself.

                The layer and feature code attributes of the output IFF  file  may
                be  set  by  the  user  using  the  SET command during the TRIEDIT
                session prior to the issue of the IFF command.   These  attributes
                are  often  complex  and  it may be simpler to have an appropriate
                series of SET commands in a TRIEDIT  command  file  which  can  be
                executed   within  TRIEDIT  using  the  @file-spec  facility  (see
                commands section).

                For further details of the characteristics of IFF files  generated
                by  the  IFF command and the TRIEDIT startup feature code defaults
                see the commands section.

             o  The  DRAW  CONTOURS  command  generates  an  IFF  file  containing
                contours derived from the currently windowed triangles.

                Two different feature codes are used to differentiate the  contour
                types.

                For further details see the DRAW CONTOURS command.

             o  The DRAW  TRIANGLES  command  generates  an  IFF  file  containing
                triangles derived from the currently display window.

                Three different feature codes are used to  differentiate  triangle
                data types.

            TRIEDIT contains a <Ctrl/C> handler.  This means that certain modes of
            TRIEDIT  processing  may be terminated by holding down the Control key
            and typing C.  This is useful if, for example, the user has  specified
            labelling (DRAW LABELS) of a large triangulation and then realises how
            long this is going to take!  By using <Ctrl/C> the  label  drawing  is
            interrupted  and  TRIEDIT  returns to the TRIEDIT> prompt.  TRIEDIT is
            ready to accept a new command.

            No harm will ensue from using <Ctrl/C> at any time  during  a  TRIEDIT
            session.   Receipt  of  a  <Ctrl/C>  at  an inappropriate time will be
            ignored.

            <Ctrl/C> will currently terminate execution of the following commands:

             o  DRAW LABELS

             o  DRAW NODES

             o  DRAW STRINGS

             o  DRAW TRIANGLES


            If output is being directed to an IFF file, the file will be correctly
            terminated  and  closed,  but of course no guarantee can be given with
            regard to validity or completeness of the file contents.

  TRIEDIT supports two graphic input options from digitising table:

        o  Laser-Scan MUART controlled digitising table

        o  Laser-Scan TABLE MONITOR controlled digitising table


  The digitising  table  option  selection  may  either  be  made  during  program
  initialisation (either explicitly on the command line or via the default options
  lookup file), or via an ENABLE TABLE or ENABLE MUART_TABLE  commmand  during  an
  edit session.

  If a digitising table is chosen as an option the user will be asked  to  set  up
  the  table-to-map-space transformation.  As DTMCREATE has no concept of fiducial
  location, only of extent, it is necessary  to  supply  the  coordinates  of  the
  fiducial marks to be used.


  DTMCREATE REFERENCE (1.8): Interactive triangulation editor             Page 6-9
                                                                   12 October 1992


  To provide fiducial values, when prompted the user can either type the X  Y  map
  coordinates for each fiducial in turn and then digitise that location, or supply
  a command file which contains the pre-typed fiducial coordinates  in  the  order
  NW,  SW,  SE and NE, one X,Y pair per line of command file.  The command file is
  specified by using the @file-spec mechanism when prompted for  the  NW  fiducial
  position.   Missing  parts  of  the  file  specification  will be taken from the
  default SYS$DISK:[].DAT.

  If a command file is used TRIEDIT will then prompt the  user  to  digitise  each
  corner  in  turn.  Clearly it is advantageous to use a corner point command file
  if the map area is likely  to  need  several  edit  sessions,  or  if  the  X  Y
  coordinates are in ground metres which tend to be prone to typing errors!

  An indirect corner point command file must obey the following rules

       1.  The corner point coordinates must be in the order NW SW SE NW

       2.  There must be only one (complete) x,y coordinate per record

       3.  Comments must be delimited by a "!".  Any characters to the right of  a
           "!" will be ignored

           input is returned to SYS$COMMAND.


  Nested command files are not supported (i.e.  a command file containing  an  '@'
  command),  although  sequential  '@'  commands  are  supported  when  read  from
  SYS$COMMAND.

  As an aid to batch log interpretation, TRIEDIT will echo all commands read  from
  an indirect command file.

  The CLEAR command causes the graphics display to be cleared and the status  area
  to be updated.

  The user may optionally select automatic redrawing of various information on the
  graphics  display  immediately  after  a CLEAR command.  The automatic redrawing
  options are:

        o  ENABLE DCUPDATE - redraw the calculated contours after a CLEAR command

        o  ENABLE DLUPDATE - redraw the selected labelling after a CLEAR command

        o  ENABLE DNUPDATE - redraw the nodes after a CLEAR command

        o  ENABLE DTUPDATE - redraw the triangulation after a CLEAR command


  Once enabled these options remain active  until  explicitly  disabled  with  the
  appropriate DISABLE command.

  It is common for the user to wish to see  the  triangulation  after  each  CLEAR
  command.  The ENABLE DTUPDATE command will save having to issue an explicit DRAW
  TRIANGLES command after each CLEAR command.

  The DATUM command enables specification of a height datum to  be  added  to  IFF
  heights read using subsequent FILEIN commands.

  On program statup a DATUM default value of 0.0 is assumed.

  Height information within a single IFF file may be stored relative to  different
  height  data  providing that the features pertaining to each height datum can be
  distinguished by feature code or layer.  The DATUM command can be  used  to  set
  the height datum for a subsequent FILEIN command.  If required a single IFF file
  may be read in many times relative to different height data,  feature  selection
  being achieved by SELECT FC and SELECT LAYER commands.

  If the INVERSE command has been used to specify height inversion the heights are
  inverted before the datum value is added.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The DELETE command enables the user to delete a whole string of  selected  nodes
  from  the  triangulation.   After  issuing  the  DELETE  command,  the user must
  position the cursor over a node in the string and press the  rightmost  function
  button.  TRIEDIT will draw a symbol over all the nodes deleted from the string.

  The "hole" left in the triangulation  by  the  deletion  will  be  automatically
  repaired with the most equilateral triangulation possible given the shape of the
  hole and the distribution of surrounding nodes.

  It is not possible to delete imaginary or cliffline nodes.

  On program startup all FCs are selected for input.

  Specific FC selections may then be made with the SELECT FC  command.   Only  the
  sepcified  FCs  will  be  used for input.  All FCs not explicitly specified in a
  SELECT FC command will then be excluded from input.

  All FC and layer selections are cancelled by the SELECT ALL command;  i.e.   all
  layers and FCs are reselected for input.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override

          An IFF layer number which must lie in the range 0  to  32767.   Multiple
          layers may be specified separated by commas or spaces.  Ranges of layers
          may be specified by separating the range start  and  stop  values  by  a

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The DESELECT LAYER command complements the SELECT LAYER command.  DESELECT LAYER
  enables  the  user to prevent TRIEDIT from reading in any IFF features which lie
  within the specified layers.

  On program startup all layers are selected for input.

  Specific layer selections may then be made with the SELECT LAYER command.   Only
  the  sepcified  layers  will  be  used  for  input.   All  layers not explicitly
  specified in SELECT LAYER commands will then be excluded from input.

  All FC and layer selections are cancelled by the SELECT ALL command;  i.e.   all
  layers and FCs are reselected for input.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status
  by  an  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  9 command, all features with FC 9 will be excluded
  from input if the user has specified a DESELECT_FC 9 command.  The use  can  use
  the  SHOW  SELECTIONS  command  to  examine  current  input  selections and SHOW
  ASSIGNMENTS to examine current assignments.

  [iff-file-spec]

          The specification of an IFF file to  which  contour  drawing  is  to  be
          directed.

          If no file-spec is supplied output is directed to the graphics screen.

          If a partial file-spec is supplied, missing parts will be taken from the
          default 'LSL$IF:IFF.IFF;0'.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  Calculate contours from the currently windowed triangles.

  If the optional IFF file-spec argument is supplied, output is  directed  to  the
  IFF file only.

  If no file-spec argument is supplied, output is directed to the graphics screen.

  On the graphics screen contours are displayed in two colours.  This enables  the
  user  to  differentiate  between  index  contours  (of  height  specified by the
  INDEX_INTERVAL command) and intermediate contours (of a height specified by  the
  INTERVAL command).

  By default 10% of the triangulation Z range is used  as  the  contour  interval.
  This  value is displayed in the status area.  If no index interval is specified,
  no index contours will be drawn.  If the intermediate contour interval  is  zero
  no intermediate contours will be drawn.

  A crude but very fast linear interpolation algorithm is used  on  each  triangle
  facet  plane  in  turn.   The  quality  of the contouring around the edge of the
  triangulation can sometimes  be  improved  by  raising  the  level  of  triangle
  accuracy  with the SET TRIANGLE_ACCURACY command.  This may, however, slow other
  edit operations.

  An automatic DRAW CONTOURS command may be selected to occur  after  every  CLEAR
  command  by  using the ENABLE DCUPDATE option.  Automatic contour output will be
  directed to the graphics screen only.

  The effect of the ENABLE DCUPDATE command will remain  active  until  explicitly
  disabled with the DISABLE DCUPDATE command.

  DRAW CONTOURS command                                            12 October 1992


  If output is directed  to  an  IFF  file  for  hardcopy  plotting  purposes  two
  different feature codes are used to differentiate the contour types.

  By default these feature codes are:

  +-----------------+--------+
  +   Contour type  |   FC   |
  +-----------------+--------+
  |   Intermediate  |    1   |
  |   Index         |    2   |
  +-----------------+--------+


  These defaults may be altered with the following commands:

  +-----------------+------------------------+
  |  Contour type   |   SET command for FC   |
  +-----------------+------------------------+
  |  Intermediate   | SET CONTOUR_FC         |
  |  Index          | SET INDEX_CONTOUR_FC   |
  +-----------------+------------------------+


  By default the IFF features will be created in layer 1, or the layer number  set
  with the most recent SET LAYER command.

  When plotting to an IFF file only contours for that portion of the triangulation
  that  would  be  displayed  on the graphics screen are sent to the IFF file.  If
  contours for the whole triangulation are to be sent to IFF file use  the  WINDOW
  command to set the screen window to cover the whole triangulation area.

  IFF coordinates are in the user units supplied to TRIANG.

  The IFF file is designed for plotting  purposes  only.   Contour  sections  are,
  wherever  possible, joined together for efficient storage and plotting.  The IFF
  features have no height tagging.

          The specification of an IFF file to which  triangle  drawing  is  to  be
          directed.

          If no file-spec is supplied output is directed to the graphics screen.

          If a partial file-spec is supplied, missing parts will be taken from the
          default 'LSL$IF:IFF.IFF;0'.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  Display (or write to an optional IFF file), the triangular connectivity  between
  nodes.

  If the optional IFF file-spec argument is supplied, output is  directed  to  the
  IFF file only.

  If no file-spec argument is supplied, output is directed to the graphics screen.

  On the graphics screen triangle links are  displayed  in  three  colours.   This
  enables  the user to differentiate triangle links that connect normal nodes from
  nodes that represent locations of slope discontinuity  (breaklines  and  cliffs)
  and imaginary points (which have location but undefined attributes).

  If output is directed to an  IFF  file  for  hardcopy  plotting  purposes  three
  different feature codes are used to differentiate the triangle links.

  By default these feature codes are:

  +-----------------+--------+
  |   Link type     |   FC   |
  +-----------------+--------+
  |   Normal        |    1   |
  |   Breakline     |    2   |
  |   Imaginary     |    3   |
  +-----------------+--------+

  DRAW TRIANGLES command                                           12 October 1992


  These defaults may be altered with the following commands:

  +-----------------+------------------------+
  |   Link type     |   SET command for FC   |
  +-----------------+------------------------+
  |   Normal        | SET LINK_FC            |
  |   Breakline     | SET BREAKLINE_LINK_FC  |
  |   Imaginary     | SET IMAGINARY_LINK_FC  |
  +-----------------+------------------------+


  By default the IFF features will be created in layer 1, or the layer number  set
  with the most recent SET LAYER command.

  When plotting to IFF file, only that portion of the triangulation that would  be
  displayed  on  the  graphics  screen  is  sent  to  the  IFF file.  If the whole
  triangulation is to be sent to IFF file use the WINDOW command to set the screen
  window to cover the whole triangulation area.

  IFF coordinates are in the user units supplied to TRIANG.

  The IFF file is designed  for  plotting  purposes  only.   Triangle  links  are,
  wherever  possible, joined together for efficient storage and plotting.  The IFF
  features have no height tagging.

  An automatic DRAW TRIANGLES command may be selected to occur after  every  CLEAR
  command  by using the ENABLE DTUPDATE option.  Automatic triangle output will be
  directed to the graphics screen only.

  The effect of the ENABLE DTUPDATE command will remain  active  until  explicitly
  disabled with the DISABLE DTUPDATE command.

  ENABLE BITPAD allows the user to select  and  enable  a  Sigmex  bitpad  as  the

  TRIEDIT supports many different graphics displays and  graphics  input  devices;
  trackerballs,  thumbwheels,  digitising  tables  etc.  However, there are severe
  compatibility restrictions between  different  graphics  displays  and  graphics
  input  devices.   When  DTMCREATE  is  installed by Laser-Scan personnel at your
  site, the available combinations of graphics display and graphics input  devices
  will  be  set  up  for  you in the lookup files referenced by TRIEDIT on program
  initialisation.   Do  not  alter  these  default  combinations   without   first
  consulting Laser-Scan.

  TRIEDIT can only accept input from one graphics input device at a time.  TRIEDIT
  will  not  allow  you  to ENABLE a new graphics input device until any currently
  active is disabled.

  Incoming IFF heights may be inverted if the ENABLE INVERSE command
  is specified prior to reading an IFF file with a FILEIN command. This enables
  modelling of hydrographic data where sea depths are often stored as positive
  heights, drying zone heights as negative and land heights as positive! 


  By default heights are not inverted. 


  If the DATUM command has been used to specify a change of height datum
  the heights are inverted before the datum value is added.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The FACET command enables the user  to  output  the  triangles  defined  by  the
  inter-node  relationships  stored within the editor, as individual IFF features.
  Each IFF feature defines the vertices of a triangle.  Each vertex has  a  height
  (Z)  and  flag  (ZB).   The  flag  indicates  whether  the vertex is a normal or
  breakline node within the triangulation, and whether the vertex  is  of  special
  geomorphological significance.

  The IFF triangle features may be used as input to triangle  based  visualisation
  software, or may be plotted using FPP or LITES2.

  Triangle features are generated for that portion of the triangulation that  lies
  within  the current screen window.  If triangle features are to be generated for
  the whole triangulation use the WINDOW command to set the screen window to cover
  the whole triangulation area.

  The IFF file differs from that optionally produced by the DRAW TRIANGLES command
  as  it  stores each inter-node link twice; once for each of the two triangles of
  which it forms a part.  The IFF file optionally created by  the  DRAW  TRIANGLES
  command  contains  each  inter-node link only once.  A single feature within the
  DRAW TRIANGLES IFF file contains links from many triangles.   The  IFF  features
  within  the  DRAW  TRIANGLES IFF file do not form triangles but are arranged for
  compact storage and efficient plotting; i.e.  purely for graphical  reproduction
  purposes.

  One result of this difference is that the FACET command can only create  an  IFF
  file  containing  a  maximum  of  65535 triangle features.  If the triangulation
  contains more than this number the WINDOW command should be used in  conjunction
  with  multiple  FACET  commands  to subdivide the triangulation into several IFF
  output IFF files.  If the user attempts to output more than 65535 triangles to a
  single  IFF  file,  a warning message is issued and the IFF file is closed in an
  incomplete state.

  FACET command                                                    12 October 1992


  The algorithm used to output the triangles to  IFF  file  ensures  that  when  a
  triangulation  is subdivided for output to multiple FACET IFF files a continuous
  cover of triangles is maintained if IFF files containing  adjacent  windows  are
  plotted side by side.  Triangles which represent links to nodes that lie outside
  of the user defined window are included in the IFF output file.   The  algorithm
  ensures  that  no  duplicate  triangles  are  output, either within a single IFF
  output file or between IFF files which share a common window boundary.

  If triangles do have links which  lie  outside  of  the  user  specified  WINDOW
  limits,  the  IFF output file RA (RAnge entry) reflects the true data range, not
  merely the WINDOW limits.  The IFF file CP (Control Point) entry does,  however,
  reflect the user specified WINDOW limits.

  To ensure that  multiple  IFF  output  files  do  share  [1mexactly[0m  common  WINDOW
  boundaries  it  is  recommemded  that  the  WINDOW command is specified with the
  optional command arguments.  Do not use the WINDOW command in  conjunction  with
  the GIN cursor.  That is:

  Another important difference between the IFF file created by the DRAW  TRIANGLES
  and FACET commands is their respective use of IFF CB (Coordinate Block) entries.
  The features in IFF files created by the FACET command  wil  always  contain  CB
  entries  regardless  of the IFF output revision level active at the user's site.
  Features in IFF files created by the DRAW TRIANGLES command  will  only  contain
  CBs  if  the IFF output revision level is set to 1 (i.e.  CBs are to be produced
  and more importantly can be handled by all IFF utility programs at that site).

  The reason for the FACET command IFF files containing CBs is to  enable  both  a
  height  (Z)  and  a  vertex  type  flag  to  be transmitted to any visualisation
  software reading the IFF file.  The vertex  type  flag  indicates  whether  each
  vertex  is  a normal or breakline node within the triangulation, and conveys any
  associated geomorphological attributes.  The vertex  type  flag  is  the  fourth
  dimension  of  each (X,Y,Z,flag) coordinate defining the triangle and is defined
  by ACD ZB (94) using  the  Laser-Scan  preset  ACD  definitions.   (For  further
  information about ACDs see the FRT User Guide in the MAPPING Reference Manual).

  Possible vertex flag (ZB) values are:

  +-----------------------------------+-------------+
  |   Vertex type                     |  Flag value |
  +-----------------------------------+-------------+
  |   Breakline ridgeline node        |   -3        |
  |   Breakline river node            |   -2        |
  |   Breakline unflagged node        |   -1        |

  |   Normal ridgeline node           |    3        |
  +-----------------------------------+-------------+


  Imaginary nodes within the triangulation have no Z value.  Triangles which  have
  imaginary vertices are omitted from FACET command IFF output files.

  IFF coordinates are in the user units supplied to TRIANG.

  By default the IFF features will be created in layer 1, or the layer number  set
  with the most recent SET LAYER command.

  By default the triangle features are given feature code 1, or the  feature  code
  set with the most recent SET LINK_FC command.

          The specification of the IFF  file  which  is  to  be  created.   If  no

          If a partial file-spec is supplied as an argument  to  the  IFF  command
          then  the  missing  parts  of  the file specification are taken from the

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The IFF command enables data to be extracted from a  triangulation  and  written
  back to an IFF file.

  By default the following feature codes are applied in the IFF file:


  +---------------------------------+--------------------+
  | Triangulation feature attribute |   FC in IFF file   |
  +---------------------------------+--------------------+
  | Unflagged string - multi node   |         1          |
  | Unflagged string - single node  |         2          |
  | River string - multiple node    |         3          |
  | River string - single node      |         4          |
  | Ridge string - multiple node    |         5          |
  | Cliff string                    |         6          |
  +---------------------------------+--------------------+


  Data types are differentiated by IFF layer:

  +---------------------------------+--------------------+
  | Triangulation data type         |   IFF layer        |
  +---------------------------------+--------------------+
  | Normal (non-break/cliff)        |         1          |
  | Breaklines                      |         2          |
  | Clifflines                      |         3          |
  +---------------------------------+--------------------+


  It can be seen from the table that, by default, triangulation feature attributes
  are  differentiated  by IFF feature code and that feature type is differentiated
  by IFF layer number.

  Using this coding scheme in the output IFF file it may be readily inferred  that
  a feature which has a feature code of 3 and which lies within layer 2 is a river
  that has been used in the triangulation as a breakline.

  Cliffline features are separated from other data by layer number.  They are also
  given a feature code that enables differentiation between cliffs and other data.

  The complete suit of SET commands required to override all  these  defaults  are
  shown in the following typical example TRIEDIT command file:

  !
  ! ASCII file to be used as an indirect TRIEDIT command file (invoked using
  ! the TRIEDIT @file-spec facility)
  !
  ! This file contains a complete set of commands to override the default
  ! feature code assignments used in IFF files created using the IFF command.
  !
  ! Note use of "!" character as a comment delimiter. All text which lies to the 
  ! right of a "!" character is ignored.
  !
  SET STRING_FC  1001
  SET POINT_FC 1002
  SET RIVER_STRING_FC  201
  SET RIVER_POINT_FC  202
  SET RIDGE_STRING_FC  305
  SET RIDGE_POINT_FC  670
  SET CLIFF_STRING_FC  671
  SET LAYER  34
  SET BREAKLINE_LAYER  2
  SET CLIFF_LAYER  8
  SET FRAME_FC 19
  !
  ! RETURN control to terminal input ...
  !
  RETURN

  Note that use of the FACET  or  IFF  commands  within  TRIEDIT  results  in  the
  generation  of  IFF  files containing CB (Coordinate Block) entries.  CB entries
  replace the use of ST (STring) and ZS (3D string) entries.

  IFF features which represent clifflines will have  the  X,Y  and  two  attribute
  fields set for each coordinate in their CBs.  The attributes are 80 ("cliff left
  height") and 81 ("cliff right height"), both of which contain a  real  (floating
  point) height value.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The INSERT command enables the user to  interactively  insert  a  new  node,  or
  nodes, into the triangulation.

  The attributes of nodes inserted with the INSERT command are defined by the  SET
  HEIGHT, SET FEATURE_FLAG and SET TYPE commands.

  Nodes may be entered singly or as strings of nodes.  These strings  may  have  a
  fixed Z value or may have a continuously varying Z value along their length.

  Nodes may be flagged as unflagged, rivers or ridgelines.  They may  be  assigned
  as either the NORMAL or BREAKLINE data type.

  Clifflines may be inserted with the INSERT command.
                                        [1mNOTE[0m

  If a node is inserted which is coincident with an existing  node,  TRIEDIT  will
  always  replace  the  existing node with the one that you have just inserted.  A
  coincident node is one which lies within the distance  defined  by  the  maximum
  triangulation extent multiplied by 7.0/300000.0.

  the  height  beforehand  with the SET HEIGHT 'height' command).  Type the height
  and press carriage return.  TRIEDIT will return to  the  TRIEDIT>  prompt.   The

  If inserting a multi-node string with varying Z values press the middle function

  represent the location of the new node.

  Add additional nodes using the leftmost function button ("node") until you  want
  to  put  in  another  master  node  for  which  you will supply a Z value.  When
  prompted, type the height and press carriage return.  A symbol will be drawn  on
  the screen to represent the location of the new node.  You will notice also that
  other symbols may be drawn between the nodes that  you  have  specified.   These
  represent  nodes  that  TRIEDIT  has  had  to  generate  to ensure that existing
  triangle links are cut by your new inserted string.  The nodes that you inserted
  explicitly  with  the leftmost function button and those automatically generated
  by TRIEDIT will be given Z values derived using linear interpolation between the
  "master" nodes that you inserted with the centre function button.

  Continue inserting  nodes  and  "master"  nodes  until  you  have  inserted  the
  penultimate node.

  Insert the last node by using  the  rightmost  function  button  ("end").   When
  prompted  for  the  final  height  type in the height and press carriage return.
  TRIEDIT will return to the TRIEDIT> prompt.  The  insertion  is  complete.   The

  LABEL SIGNS enables the user to specify that input string sign flags are  to  be
  displayed when a DRAW LABELS command is issued.

  DTMCREATE preserves the concept of inter node connectivity inherent  in  strings
  of  input nodes by flagging in memory the nodes of successive input strings with
  a change of sign.  These sign flags '+' and '-' will be drawn as labels next  to
  each  node  if  the  LABEL  SIGNS  option  is selected and a DRAW LABELS command
  issued.

  A change of string is signified wherever a change of sign occurs.

  Due to the nature of the triangulation process, and of subsequent  TRIEDIT  edit
  sessions,  original  input strings may be fragmented.  Many more changes of sign
  may occur than would  be  expected  if  all  the  original  input  strings  were
  preserved intact.

  LABEL HEIGHT, LABEL SEQUENCE and LABEL SIGNS selections may be  cancelled  using
  the LABEL NONE command.

  LABEL SMALL enables the user to specify that labels are to be
  displayed using small characters.


  LABEL SMALL is the TRIEDIT startup default.


  After issuing an explicit  LABEL SMALL command labelling with small
  characters will persist until a LABEL BIG command is issued.


  The effect of ENABLE BIG and ENABLE SMALL commands applies
  to labels drawn automatically under ENABLE DLUPDATE control.

          An IFF feature code which must lie in the range 0  to  32767.   Multiple
          feature codes may be specified separated by commas or spaces.  Ranges of
          feature codes may be specified by separating the range  start  and  stop
          values  by  a  colon e.g.  SELECT FC 2:6 will result in the selection of
          feature codes 2,3,4,5 and 6.

          If an FRT file has been read into TRIEDIT any valid feature  code  group

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The SELECT FC command complements the DESELECT FC command.

  SELECT FC selects all features with specified IFF feature codes for inclusion in
  the triangulation.

  On program startup all FCs are selected for input.  IFF features which  are  not
  required  for input must be specifically excluded using the appropriate DESELECT
  FC and DESELECT LAYER commands.  For example, the command DESELECT FC 0:7 11:300
  302:32767 will leave only features with FCs 8,9,10, and 301 selected for input.

  The first SELECT FC command has the effect of deselecting  all  FCs  from  input
  except  those  explicitly  specified  as the arguments to the SELECT FC command.
  Subsequent SELECT FC commands have the effect of adding the specified FCs to the
  list of FCs selected for input.

  All layers and FCs may be reselected for input  by  specifying  the  SELECT  ALL
  command.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status
  by  an  ASSIGN  BREAKLINE_FC  9 command, all features with FC 9 will be excluded
  from input if the user has specified a DESELECT_FC  9  command.   Use  the  SHOW
  SELECTIONS  command to examine current input selections and the SHOW ASSIGNMENTS
  command to examine current assignments.

  The SELECT LAYER command complements the DESELECT LAYER command.   SELECT  LAYER
  enables  the  user  to  select  any  IFF features which are contained within the
  specified layers.

  By default TRIEDIT will input all features within an IFF file, regardless of the
  layer in which they lie.

  On program startup all layers are selected for input.  IFF  features  which  are
  not  required  for  input  must  be  specifically excluded using the appropriate
  DESELECT FC and DESELECT LAYER commands.   For  example,  the  command  DESELECT
  LAYER  0:7  11:300  302:32767  will  leave only features which lie within layers
  8,9,10, and 301 selected for input.

  The first SELECT LAYER command has the effect of  deselecting  all  layers  from
  input  except  those  explicitly  specified as the arguments to the SELECT LAYER
  command.  Subsequent SELECT  LAYER  commands  have  the  effect  of  adding  the
  specified layers to the list of FCs selected for input.

  All layers and FCs may be reselected for input  by  specifying  the  SELECT  ALL
  command.

  Note that selections made with the DESELECT and SELECT  commands  will  override
  input  data assignments (e.g.  ASSIGN BREAKLINE_FC) which share the same feature
  code or layer numbers.  Thus even though FC 9 has been assigned breakline status

  By default, TRIEDIT uses layer 3.

  Note that use of the FACET  or  IFF  commands  within  TRIEDIT  results  in  the

  replace the use of ST (STring) and ZS (3D string) entries.

  IFF features which represent clifflines will have  the  X,Y  and  two  attribute

          unflagged node features.  This must lie in the range 0 to 32767.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The feature code set up  by  the  SET  POINT_FC  command  is  used  by  the  IFF
  'iff-file-spec'  command.   It  provides  a mechanism to enable single point IFF
  features representing isolated unflagged nodes to be differentiated from similar
  features  representing  isolated  river  and  ridgeline  nodes.  A different IFF
  feature code has to be used for single point  IFF  features  to  that  used  for
  multi-point  "string"  features to ensure that the feature is plotted correctly.
  It is normal practice to plot single point IFF features using a symbol (e.g.   a
  dot, cross or a box).

  By allowing the user  to  distinguish  between  single  point  features,  it  is
  possible  to  read  the  IFF  file  created  by the TRIEDIT IFF command into the
  triangulation module TRIANG for retriangulation.  TRIANG has to be told what the
  isolated nodes represent.

  All single point IFF features representing non-breakline nodes (including  river
  and  ridgeline  nodes)  are placed in the same IFF layer (set with the SET LAYER
  command).

  All single point IFF features representing breakline nodes (including river  and
  ridgeline  nodes)  are  placed  in  a  different  IFF  layer  (set  with the SET
  BREAKLINE_LAYER command).

  Clifflines can never occur as single nodes.

  When choosing a feature code for single point IFF features representing isolated
  unflagged  nodes, ensure that the feature code is in the FRT file which is to be
  used for plotting the IFF file and that the  feature  code  has  an  appropriate
  graphical type, i.e. unoriented symbol.

  Note that use of the FACET  or  IFF  commands  within  TRIEDIT  results  in  the
  generation  of  IFF  files containing CB (Coordinate Block) entries.  CB entries
  replace the use of ST (STring) and ZS (3D string) entries.

  Shows current triangulation window values.

  The units of the WINDOW command parameters are set using the UNITS command.   By
  default metre units are assumed.  If it is more convenient to specify the window
  in latitude and longitude the sexagesimal lat long values may be supplied  after
  specifying a UNITS LATLONG command.  This assumes that the data read in from the
  DTI and IFF files are in units of tenths second of arc.  A similar assumption is
  made for UNITS SECONDS.

  The SHOW WINDOW command displays  the  window  values  in  the  units  currently
  selected  by  the  UNITS command.  No projection transformation is performed, so
  the unwise user could easily specify  that  the  window  be  shown  as  latitude
  longitude despite the fact that his data are in metres!

  The SWAP command enables the user to specify that the selected  inter-node  link
  is  to  be  swapped diagonally within the quadrilateral formed by the four nodes
  defining the two triangles which share the selected link.

  After typing the SWAP command, place the cursor on the inter-node link  that  is
  to swapped.  Press the rightmost function button.  If the cursor is too far from
  the nearest link a warning message will be issued.  If it is  possible  to  swap
  the  link  the old link will be obliterated with symbols and the path of the new
  swapped link indicated with a line of open symbols.

  There are instances when it is not possible to swap an inter-node link within  a
  quadrilateral.  If the quadrilateral is re-entrant, crossing internode links may
  occur if the swap is allowed to take place.  Checks are  performed  and  warning
  messages  issued  if  a harmful SWAP has been attempted.  The triangulation will
  not be changed.

  It is usually possible to overcome the problem of a re-entrant quadrilateral  by
  swapping  other  inter-node  links  around  it  first  until the distribution of
  triangle links is better.

  The  command  is  used  to  define  rectangular  limits  to  the  area  of   the

  The WINDOW command differs from the  ZOOM  command  in  that  the  area  of  the
  triangulation  currently  displayed  is  shown as a box on the graphics display.
  The whole area of triangulation coverage is portrayed by an outer box.   If  the
  current window covers the whole triangulation only a single, full sized box will
  be displayed.

  The window command parameters are optional.  If omitted, the user is expected to
  define the WINDOW using the cursor.

  If WINDOW command parameters are specified the WINDOW command  may  be  used  in
  conjunction  with  the  NOGRAPHICS  graphics device option, i.e.  at an ordinary
  VT100 compatible terminal.

  If the optional WINDOW command parameters are omitted, the WINDOW limits must be
  specified  by moving the cursor to one corner of the desired window and pressing
  the rightmost function button.  An arrow head symbol will appear on the  screen.

  These messages indicate an error in processing which will cause the  program  to

  file, or an error related to command line processing and file manipulation.

  OPNSCR, error opening scratch file SYS$DISK:[]TRIEDIT.TMP

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The data set read in has exceeded the current  TRIEDIT  memory
      quota  and  a  random access disk file was going to be opened to contain the
      surplus.  However, TRIEDIT has failed to open this random access file.

  STACKOVR, stack overflow - triangulation will be destroyed

      [1mExplanation:[0m  TRIEDIT has only a finite amount of space available  to  store
      new  points  that  have been inserted into the data structure.  You have now
      used up all this space  and  TRIEDIT  will  have  to  give  up,  losing  the
      triangulation  in  the  process.  It is very unlikely that you will get this
      message as a minimum of 33% of workspace is reserved for storage  of  points
      generated  during  constraint.   The data supplied to TRIEDIT must have been
      very poorly distributed to have caused this failure.

      Laser-Scan.

  TOOMNYNODW, too many nodes in window

  ARITHMETIC, arithmetic exception detected

      [1mExplanation:[0m  TRIEDIT contains an arithmetic exception handler which invokes
      the "QUIT or SAVE" user escape route in the event of arithmetic error.  Such
      an error has just occurred, the precise nature of which is  defined  by  the

  BOXOVR, too little space for boxes

      [1mExplanation:[0m  TRIEDIT uses  the  box  structure  created  by  TRIANG.   Your
      current  version  of  TRIEDIT is insufficiently dimensioned to cope with the
      number of boxes just read in.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m   This  should  never  happen  as  the  DTMCREATE  modules  are
      dimensioned  to  be  mutually  compatible!   Please  report  this  error  to
      Laser-Scan.  Until TRIEDIT can be redimensioned divide up your original  IFF
      file  and  re-run  TRIANG  on  the  resulting  sub-areas.  TRIEDIT will then
      probably be able to cope with the reduced  data  set  size.   The  resulting
      sub-DTMs can be joined to form the whole DTM area using DTITILE.

  BUFFOVR, buffer overflow detected in PLOTQ

      [1mExplanation:[0m  If an extremely long string insertion is  attempted  then  the
      buffer  used to hold the inserted point coordinates for height interpolation
      may be filled.  Normally the buffer automatically  flushes  before  overflow
      can occur.  The buffer has overflowed.  This should not occur.

  DUFFNOD, duff node found in neighbour list - GARBAG

      [1mExplanation:[0m  When internal space becomes full TRIEDIT garbage  collects  as
      much as possible by removing all duff points from the data set, and from the
      memory/disk file.  Duff points are points which have  been  deleted  by  the
      DELETE  command, or which have been replaced by another point as a result of
      an INSERT or FILEIN command.  This may make a vital difference  for  complex
      much  overwritten  data  sets.  Neighbour list for each node are obtained to
      allow the gaps for duff nodes in the data list to be removed.  There appears
      (incorrectly)  to be a duff node still within a neighbour list.  There is no
      hope of continuing the editing session.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.

            TRIGRID takes the triangulation node and data files created by  TRIANG
            (or  edited  output  from  TRIEDIT)  and  the  slope  derivative  file
            generated by TRIDER, and produces a DTI (Digital Terrain Image) output
            file containing a regular grid DTM.

            Once the triangulation  and  derivative  input  files  are  available,
            TRIGRID  may  be  used  repeatedly  to produce DTM grids from the same
            triangulation area at differing resolutions.

            TRIGRID offers 2 types of interpolation from the  triangular  form  to
            the DTM grid.

            1.  a linear facet option, (see DISABLE SMOOTH command)

            2.  a SMOOTH patch option, (see ENABLE SMOOTH command)


            The smooth patch option is enabled by default.

            The advantage of using the linear FACET approach is that it is  faster
            and  will definitely produce no values outside the z-range of the data
            set.  If a surface is well defined by contours and spot heights  or  a
            quick  "look-see"  model is required then the FACET option is strongly
            recommended.

            The SMOOTH patch option is the most  complicated  as  it  generates  a
            fully edge continuous interpolation across the triangulated area.  The
            smooth patch option  uses  a  quintic  surface  patch  fitted  to  the
            vertices  and  estimated derivatives of the triangles to interpolate a
            grid node location falling within the triangle.  The option should  be
            used  with caution, as in areas of very sparse data points the results
            are those of a mathematical patch, NOT necessarily those of a physical
            environment  function!   There  are  however modifying triangle limits
            (see Commands section) which may be applied in  association  with  the
            smooth  patch  option,  which  can  be  used to prevent undershoot and
            overshoot outside a specified z-range.  There are no  triangle  limits
            to be set up for the linear FACET option.

            The size of the DTM generated by TRIGRID is controlled by either:

            1.  specifying the geographical extent of the model  with  the  WINDOW
                command  (an  obligatory command) and then specifying the DTM cell
                side length in X and Y, using  the  SIDELENGTH  command.   TRIGRID
                then calculates the resulting number of DTM rows and columns, or,

            2.  specifying the geographical extent of the model  with  the  WINDOW
                command and then explicitly stating the number of columns and rows
                using the SIZE command.

            For the simplest possible  gridding  run  TRIGRID  requires  that  the
            following obligatory commands are given:

                            1) WINDOW
                            2) SIZE (or SIDELENGTH)
                            3) FILEIN
                            4) FILEOUT
                            5) GO

                WINDOW 'xmin' 'ymin' 'xmax' 'ymax' - determines  the  geographical
                extent of the DTM to be gridded, for example:

                WINDOW 40.0 20.0 100.0 100.0

                defines the area of the DTM as lying between forty and one hundred
                units  in  X  and  twenty and one hundred units in Y.  Data in the
                triangulation files which lie outside the specified area  will  be
                ignored.

                The specified extent need not cover the whole  area  contained  in
                the  structured  data  files.   It  is  possible  to  "window" out
                sub-areas of DTM and patch them together to form a complete  model
                using the MATRIX DTITILE utility at a later date.

            TRIGRID expects as input the binary structured data files (the matched
            pair  of  .NOD and .DTA files) produced by TRIANG or TRIEDIT.  It also
            needs the slope derivative (.DER) file produced by TRIDER.  All  three
            files  must  share  the  same  generic filename and must have the same
            version  number.   The  single  TRIGRID  FILEIN  command  supplies   a
            file-spec  which  is  used  as a generic file-spec for all three input

                                                                   12 October 1992


            (.NOD, .DTA and .DER) files.

            Any parts missing from the generic file-specification are  taken  from
            the defaults SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0 and SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0.

            Since it is essential that the file version numbers of the .NOD,  .DTA
            and  .DER  file  always match, TRIGRID performs checks on file version
            numbers.  If  mismatches  are  found,  TRIGRID  complains  and  aborts
            execution.

            Never use the VAX/VMS RENAME or COPY commands  to  alter  the  version
            numbers  of .NOD, .DTA files or .DER files to make them into a matched
            set.  TRIDER will have to be re-run every time that the .NOD and  .DTA
            files are modified using TRIEDIT.

            The output files from TRIANG, TRIEDIT and TRIDER will be scaled to lie
            between  0 and the value defined by logical, LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION,
            or 300000 if the logical is not defined.  The  valid  range  for  this
            resolution is between 300000 and 10000000.

            TRIGRID uses this logical value to determine the  internal  resolution
            of the .NOD, .DTA and .DER files.

                                          IMPORTANT

                    It is  therefore  essential  that  the  logical  value
                    LSL$DTMCREATE_RESOLUTION  remains  the same when going
                    from TRIANG all  the  way  through  to  TRIGRID  on  a
                    particular  dataset.   If  the  resolution  is altered
                    between any of the stages, unpredictable results  will
                    occur and programs may fail.

            TRIGRID generates output files in DTI (Digital Terrain Image)  format,
            (for  a  description  of  DTI format see the MATRIX Reference Manual).
            TRIGRID offers the choice of output of 3 DTI data types:

             o  WORD

             o  LONGWORD

             o  REAL


            These may be set using the DATA_TYPE command.

            By default a DTI file of data type WORD is generated.

            TRIGRID also offers the user a choice of 3 DTI header types:

             o  TED4

             o  UHL1

             o  LSLA


            By default the DTI file is given the LSLA type header.

            If a set type 2 IFF MD (Map Descriptor) or a set DTI  file  projection
            record  were  available  in  the  first  file read into TRIANG using a
            FILEIN command, TRIANG puts this information into the  .NOD  and  .DTA
            files.   If  TRIGRID  is  creating a DTI file with an LSLA type header
            this projection information is copied from the  .DTA  amd  .NOD  files
            into  the  TRIGRID  DTI file header after appropriate modifications of
            extent, origin and gridstep.

            The output DTI file header type  may  be  set  using  the  HEADER_TYPE
            command.

            For details of the characteristics of the different  DTI  file  header
            types see the Matrix Reference Manual.  For information about which of
            the header characteristics are set  by  TRIGRID  see  the  HEADER_TYPE

       2.  a GO command is detected - after completion of grid generation  TRIGRID
           exits.

       3.  end-of-file is detected.  This provokes an error  message  and  command
           input is returned to SYS$COMMAND.


  Nested command files are not supported (i.e.  a command file containing  an  '@'
  command),  although  sequential  '@'  commands  are  supported  when  read  from
  SYS$COMMAND.

  As an aid to batch log interpretation TRIGRID will echo all commands  read  from
  an indirect command file.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The DATA_TYPE allows the user to specify the data type of the  output  DTI  file
  which contains the DTM grid.

  By default TRIGRID generates a 'MIKE' type DTI file having WORD (16 bit integer)
  post values.

  When choosing the data type of the DTI file, consideration must be given to  the
  Z  range  of  the  data to be output.  TRIEDIT will output the DTMCREATE default
  null value (-32767) if data underflow or overflow occurs when writing to the DTI
  file.

  Consideration must also be given to the nature of the output DTM.  Remember that
  integer  DTI  data  types  (WORD  and  LONGWORD) quantise the Z data values.  By
  default Z values are truncated to the next lower integer  value.   If  the  NINT
  option  is  enabled,  Z  values  in integer DTI files are rounded to the nearest
  whole integer.

  DISABLE NINT allows the user to cancel the effect  of  a  previous  ENABLE  NINT
  command.

  When output is directed to a word or  longword  DTI  file  it  is  necessary  to
  convert  the  real height value interpolated within TRIGRID to an integer value.
  This conversion is normally done  using  the  FORTRAN  NINT  intrinsic  function
  (round  to  nearest  integer).   However,  some  customers prefer to use integer
  truncation (FORTRAN INT intrinsic function).

  The ENABLE NINT and DISABLE NINT commands allow the user  to  specify  which  of
  these two functions is to be used, i.e.

          ENABLE NINT - use NINT, round to nearest integer value (Default) 
          DISABLE NINT - use INT, truncate to integer value

  By default, the NINT option is enabled during program startup.

  When  the  ORTHOGONAL  option  is  active,  individual  triangle   interpolation
  under-shoot  and  over-shoot limits are applied orthogonal to the triangle facet
  plane.  The default action is to apply the limits vertically regardless  of  the
  slope of the triangle facet plane.  ENABLE ORTHOGONAL is not recommended for use
  with data sets which have regularly spaced contours of regular interval but will
  be  beneficial if the contour data have an irregular interval and have irregular
  spacing.

  By default, the ORTHOGONAL option is disabled during program startup.

  The DISABLE SMOOTH command disables grid point  estimation  by  smooth  patches.
  Grid  heights  are  instead  estimated  using  linear  interpolation  across the

  smooth appearance to a DTM surface than that given by linear facets.

  If smooth patch interpolation is  selected,  individual  triangle  interpolation
  limits are applied.  Linear facet interpolation, by definition, does not need to

  plane.

  DISABLE TRACE allows the user to cancel the effect of a  previous  ENABLE  TRACE
  command.

  The TRACE option causes TRIGRID to  calculate  up-hill/down-hill  side  of  line
  context  for  the original data strings input to (and optionally constrained) in
  TRIANG.   These  up-hill/down-hill  data  are  then  used   to   apply   further
  interpolation  limits  to  each  individual  triangle.   These additional limits
  ensure that triangles whose vertices indicate a  flat  plane  do  bulge  in  the
  correct  direction  relative  to  surrounding  hill  slopes  even when the slope
  derivatives  estimated  for  the  triangle  vertices  conflict  due  to  complex
  surrounding relief.

  It is strongly recommended that the trace option is  selected,  particularly  if
  the resulting DTM is to be re-contoured.

  By default, the TRACE option is disabled during program startup.

  Because it is usually used in a batch processing environment, by default TRIGRID
  produces  minimal  diagnostic  printout.  If however, the user wishes to receive
  indications of processing progress and of  the  effect  of  selections  on  data
  input, diagnostic printout may be selected with the ENABLE DIAGNOSTICS command.

  On a heavily loaded computer it may  be  reassuring  to  ENABLE  DIAGNOSTICS  to
  indicate  progress  through  the data set.  If SYS$OUTPUT is directed to a video

  When output is directed to a word or  longword  DTI  file  it  is  necessary  to
  convert  the  real height value interpolated within TRIGRID to an integer value.
  This conversion is normally done  using  the  FORTRAN  NINT  intrinsic  function
  (round  to  nearest  integer).   However,  some  customers prefer to use integer
  truncation (FORTRAN INT intrinsic function).

  The ENABLE NINT and DISABLE NINT commands allow the user  to  specify  which  of
  these two functions is to be used, i.e.

          ENABLE NINT - use NINT, round to nearest integer value (Default) 
          DISABLE NINT - use INT, truncate to integer value


  By default, the NINT option is enabled during program startup.

  The ENABLE SMOOTH command enables  grid  point  estimation  by  smooth  patches.
  Smooth  patch estimation tends to give a more rounded smooth appearance to a DTM
  surface than that given by linear facets.

  By default, the SMOOTH option is enabled during program startup.

  If smooth patch interpolation is  selected,  individual  triangle  interpolation
  limits are applied.  Linear facet interpolation, by definition, does not need to
  apply interpolation limits as interpolation is restricted to the triangle  facet
  plane.

  The DISABLE SMOOTH command disables grid point  estimation  by  smooth  patches.
  Grid  heights  are  instead  estimated  using  linear  interpolation  across the
  triangle facet planes.

  For further details of interpolation limits, see the LIMITS, TRIANGLE_LIMITS and
  ENABLE AUTO_LIMITS commands.

  context  for  the original data strings input to (and optionally constrained) in
  TRIANG.   These  up-hill/down-hill  data  are  then  used   to   apply   further
  interpolation  limits  to  each  individual  triangle.   These additional limits
  ensure that triangles whose vertices indicate a  flat  plane  do  bulge  in  the
  correct  direction  relative  to  surrounding  hill  slopes  even when the slope
  derivatives  estimated  for  the  triangle  vertices  conflict  due  to  complex
  surrounding relief.

  It is strongly recommended that the trace option is  selected,  particularly  if
  the resulting DTM is to be re-contoured.

  By default, the TRACE option is disabled during program startup.

  file-spec

          The generic specification of the .NOD .DTA and .DER files to  be  opened
          for data input.

          All components of the supplied file-spec are used to form the input file
          specifications  but  with  the substitution of the extensions .NOD, .DTA
          and .DER and version number ';0', i.e.  latest version  (shared  by  all
          three files).

          The default file-spec used to  make  up  missing  parts  of  the  FILEIN
          file-spec   parameter  is  dependent  on  the  status  of  logical  name
          LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK.

          If logical  name  LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK  is  defined,  DTMCREATE  utilities
          translate  the  logical  name to get the default file-spec for input and
          output of triangulation files.  The logical name should  be  defined  to
          provide  a  device  and  directory  name  only.   The DTMCREATE programs
          themselves provide the default filename  and  extension  fields  of  the
          specification.    For  example,  a  valid  definition  of  logical  name
          LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK is:

          $ DEFINE LSL$DTMCREATE_WORK LSL$DATA_ROOT:[LSL.DTMCREATE]

          This mechanism allows all DTMCREATE triangulation files to be stored  in
          a  central  directory,  rather  than  scattered  in  many different user
          directories.  It thus mimics the use of logical  names  LSL$IF  for  IFF
          files and LSL$DTI for DTI files.

          If the logical name is not defined,  any  parts  of  the  file-spec  not
          supplied  for  the  FILEIN  command  will  be  taken  from  the defaults
          'SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0' 'SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0' and 'SYS$DISK:[].DER;0'.   These
          defaults  result in the files being searched for in your current default
          directory, set using the VMS SET DEFAULT or Laser-Scan SD commands.

  Any parts missing from the generic file-specification are taken  from  the  from
  the defaults SYS$DISK:[].DTA;0 and SYS$DISK:[].NOD;0.

  Since it is essential that the file version numbers of the .NOD, .DTA  and  .DER

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The FILEOUT command is used to specify the DTI file which is to be  created  and
  opened for data output.

  The DTI file is not actually created and opened until a GO command is  accepted,
  as  the  user  may redefine the DTI header type (HEADER_TYPE command) or the DTI
  data type (DATA_TYPE command) after issuing the FILEOUT command.

  By default TRIGRID creates a DTI file having an LSLA type header and  word  data
  type.

  The characteristics of the output DTI file are determined by the HEADER_TYPE and
  DATA_TYPE  commands,  and its size by combinations of WINDOW, SIZE or SIDELENGTH
  commands.

  If a set type 2 IFF MD (Map Descriptor) or a set DTI file projection record were
  available in the first file read into TRIANG using a FILEIN command, TRIANG puts
  this information into the .NOD and .DTA files.  If TRIGRID  is  creating  a  DTI
  file  with  an  LSLA  type header this projection information is copied from the
  .DTA amd  .NOD  files  into  the  TRIGRID  DTI  file  header  after  appropriate
  modifications of extent, origin and gridstep.

  In contrast, it is left to the user to set DTED DTI file header  contents  using
  DTEDIFF and MCEHED.

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  When all necessary files have been read in the GO command  will  cause  the  DTI
  file  specified with the FILEOUT command to be created and opened.  TRIGRID will
  then commence the gridding process.  Unless relatively small data-sets are being
  handled  (say  less  then  50,000  data  points) it is strongly recommended that
  TRIGRID is run in batch mode at an off-peak time.

  When grid creation is complete, TRIGRID closes the  output  DTI  file  and  then
  exits.

  Before the GO command  will  be  accepted,  TRIGRID  performs  checks  that  the
  following obligatory commands have been issued:

                  1) WINDOW
                  2) SIZE (or SIDELENGTH)
                  3) FILEIN
                  4) FILEOUT

  If one (or more) of these commands has not yet been issued and accepted, TRIGRID
  will ignore the GO command and prompt for further commands at the terminal.  The
  SHOW ENABLE command can be used to discover the current command option settings.

  *** WARNING *** The following commands must be given
                  before processing can begin:
                  1) WINDOW

                  3) FILEIN
                  4) FILEOUT

  Once the GO command has been accepted no more conversational messages of the ***
  WARNING  ***  format  will  be  issued.   Any  messages  will  relate to serious
  processing problems and will normally result in  abnormal  TRIGRID  termination.
  The  messages  relating  to non-interactive processing problems are presented at
  the end of this document.

  type

          A DTI header type keyword chosen from:

           o  TED4 - generate a TED4 type DTI

           o  UHL1 - generate a UHL1 type DTI

           o  LSLA - generate a LSLA type DTI


  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The HEADER_TYPE allows the user to specify the header type  of  the  output  DTI
  file which contains the DTM grid.

  By default TRIGRID generates a 'LSLA' type DTI file having WORD (16 bit integer)
  post values.

  For a detailed description of the layout and content of DTI  file  header  types
  see the DTILIB section of the MATRIX Reference Manual.

  The default LSLA type DTI header contains only the matrix  X  and  Y  extent,  Z
  range and the X and Y grid interval.

  Due to the general purpose nature of TRIGRID it is not possible to collect  from
  the  user,  and  validate,  all  the  complex information required to complete a
  military TED4 or UHL1 DTI header.  Instead TRIGRID puts  into  a  TED4  or  UHL1
  header the same information as for a LSLA type DTI.  If output is to a TED4 type
  DTI file, the Latitude and Longitude  origin  and  the  Latitude  and  Longitude
  bounding  rectangle  values  are inserted into the DSI record.  These values are
  taken from the WINDOW command arguments.  It is assumed that  the  triangulation
  units are tenths of seconds of arc.

  The user is left to use the MATRIX package utility DTIPATCH to  set  up  missing
  information.

  Shows current triangulation and DTM window values.

  The units of the WINDOW command parameters are set using the UNITS command.   By
  default metre units are assumed.  If it is more convenient to specify the window
  in latitude and longitude the sexagesimal lat long values may be supplied  after
  specifying a UNITS LATLONG command.  This assumes that the data read in from the
  DTI and IFF files uaing TRIANG were in units of tenths second of arc.  A similar
  assumption is made for UNITS SECONDS.

  The SHOW WINDOW command displays  the  window  values  in  the  units  currently
  selected  by  the  UNITS command.  No projection transformation is performed, so
  the unwise user could easily specify  that  the  window  be  shown  as  latitude
  longitude despite the fact that his data are in metres!

  The SIDELENGTH command enables the user  to  specify  the  spacing  between  the
  columns  and rows of the output DTM.  The SIDELENGTH command arguments should be
  specified in the units used for the triangulation.

  If a SIZE command  has  already  been  issued  then  the  SIZE  values  will  be
  overridden by new size values calculated when WINDOW is set using:

          NUMBER OF COLUMNS = X WINDOW LENGTH/ X_SIDELENGTH +1.5

          NUMBER OF ROWS    = Y WINDOW LENGTH/ Y_SIDELENGTH +1.5

  and the message:

          Over-riding SIZE settings

  will appear.

  If the WINDOW is set, the  number  of  rows  and  columns  to  cover  completely
  (possibly  with  some overlap) the specified area is calculated.  The results of
  this calculation will be displayed:

  Window units are metres

  Triangulation coverage SW:  'real' 'real' NE:  'real' 'real'
  Triangulation window   SW:  'real' 'real' NE:  'real' 'real'

  Which with a side length of    10.00 in X and     10.00 in Y
  gives 'integer' rows and 'integer' columns in the dtm


  You may use the SIDELENGTH and WINDOW commands in combination as  often  as  you
  wish until the desired model characteristics are achieved.

          Overshoot limit for individual triangles.  This is the amount  (measured
          in  the  model  Z value units) that an interpolation within the triangle
          may exceed the range of heights given by the values at the  vertices  of
          the  triangle.  A suggested limit is approx 1 contour interval.  Default

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDescription:[0m

  By default TRIGRID applies no limits to post height estimation.

  The undershoot and overshoot limits for individual triangles define how  far  an
  interpolation  within  the triangle may fall below or above the range of heights
  given by the values at the vertices  of  the  triangle.   These  undershoot  and
  overshoot  limits  are  automatically modified by the ENABLE AUTO_LIMITS command
  when appropriate node feature flags are detected.  For example, a triangle which
  has  one or more nodes flagged as "river" nodes will be allowed no interpolation
  undershoot at all.

  No triangle limits are applied if  the  linear  facet  interpolation  option  is
  selected  as the interpolation is restricted to the triangle facet plane itself.
  The same effect can be achieved  (rather  extravagantly)  by  setting  both  the
  undershoot  and overshoot triangle limits to 0.0 and then using the SMOOTH patch
  interpolation option!

  [1mDESCRIPTION:[0m

  The UNITS command enables the user to specify in what units  of  measurement  he
  wishes  to  define  the DTM window using the WINDOW command, or in what units of
  measurement details from the header of the DTI file are displayed.

  By default metre units are assumed.
  The UNITS command should be given before specifying  the  DTM  window  the  user
  wishes to specify the window in non-metre units.

  If UNITS SECONDS or UNITS LATLONG are used it is assumed that the data  read  in
  from the .DTA and .NOD files using FILEIN commands are in units of tenth seconds
  of arc.

  UNITS METRES (the default) or UNITS PROJECTION assume that the the data read  in
  using FILEIN commands are in metres or projection units.

  Remember that TRIGRID assumes  that  if  UNITS  SECONDS  or  UNITS  LATLONG  are
  selected the basic units in the .DTA snd .  NOD files are tenth seconds arc.

  The UNITS command does not affect the  values  specified  as  arguments  to  the
  SIDELENGTH  command.  These should be expressed in terms of the basic units held
  in the .NOD and .DTA files  (i.e.   tenth  second  arc  units  in  the  case  of
  geographical  SECONDS  or LATLONG).  In the case of UNITS LATLONG, window values
  should  be  expressed  as  south-west  [1mLatitude[0m  [1mLongitude[0m  north-east  [1mLatitude[0m
  [1mLongitude[0m,  [1mnot[0m  [1mLongitude[0m  [1mLatitude[0m.   The SHOW WINDOW command will reflect the
  window extent in both LATLONG units and tenth seconds arc.

  The WINDOW command  is  used  to  define  rectangular  limits  to  the  area  of
  triangulation  to  be  gridded into a DTI file.  The limits must be specified in
  the order bottom left hand (or south west) corner, then top right hand (or north
  east) corner.

  The WINDOW command can be used to clip data from a triangulation.

  There is only one restriction on the WINDOW grid coverage  allowed  relative  to
  the  triangulation  extent.  The grid DTM must have a minimum of 3 columns and 3
  rows.  The user may  specify  that  the  grid  DTM  WINDOW  extends  beyond  the
  triangulation   area.    Of  course  there  are  no  original  data  points  for
  interpolation in the resulting marginal areas and the proclivities of  a  poorly
  controlled mathematical surface may not truly represent the real world!

  If the user is unsure of the triangulation (X,Y) extent a  SHOW  WINDOW  command
  will  supply  this  information  assuming  that  the  triangulation  files  have
  previously been opened with the FILEIN command.

  The WINDOW command is obligatory.

  [1mDescription:[0m

  By default TRIGRID applies no limits to post height estimation.

  The ZLIMITS command specifies lower and upper absolute range  limits  to  enable
  the  user  to  force  a  base  and  ceiling  value for the whole model which the
  interpolation cannot exceed or fall under.   This  is  particularly  useful  for
  models  containing  areas  of sea as the lower limit can be set to zero ensuring
  that the sea cannot receive negative post values  under  any  circumstances.   A
  model whose highest area forms a plateau can be similarly controlled.

            This example shows a sequence of TRIGRID commands used to  generate  a
            DTI  output  file  having  a  'LSLA' type header and word integer post
            values.

            TRIGRID introduces itself by giving the full name and creation date of
            the  current version of the program.  The user has chosen to issue the
            TRIGRID commands  by  use  of  an  indirect  command  file  using  the
            @file-spec facility.  After successfully opening the specified command
            file, SYS$DISK:[]TESTCMD.COM; TRIGRID issues a message indicating  the
            file-spec  used.  All command input will be taken from this file until
            end of file is detected, a command error is detected, a RETURN command
            is  detected, or a GO command results in successful termination of the
            run.

            The first command specifies that input is to be  from  a  file  called
            WEEPY.   Only  a file-name is supplied and TRIGRID parses this against
            the user's current default device and directory  specification.   This
            results in the file specification
            LSL$SOURCE_ROOT:[DTMCREATE.TRIGRID]WEEPY.DTA This is used as a generic
            specification  for  all  three input files required by TRIGRID, a .DTA
            file containing the internode relationships, a  .NOD  file  containing
            the nodes themselves and a .DER file containing slope derivatives.

            These files are opened in turn and  a  message  indicating  successful
            opening issued.

            The ZLIMITS command specifies that  no  DTM  post  values  are  to  be
            generated  below 100 or above 500 height units.  The height units were
            originally set in TRIANG.

            The TRIANGLE_LIMITS command is used to  set  the  undershoot  (5)  and
            overshoot  limits  (15) for individual triangles.  These limits define
            how far an interpolation within the triangle may fall below  or  above
            the  range  of  heights  given  by  the  values at the vertices of the
            triangle.  The undershoot and overshoot are automatically modified  by
            the ENABLE AUTO_LIMITS command when appropriate node feature flags are
            detected.  For example, a triangle which has one or more nodes flagged
            as  "river"  nodes will be allowed no interpolation undershoot at all.
            AUTO_LIMITS are enabled by default on  program  startup  and  must  be
            explicitly disabled if not required.

            As this program run is to be used as an example, the user has used the
            ENABLE  DIAGNOSTICS  command  to  cause  TRIGRID  to output diagnostic
            messages.  Where  a  processing  stage  may  take  a  long  time,  the
            selection  of  diagnostics  will  cause messages indicating percentage
            progress to  be  output.   In  the  interests  of  compactness,  these
            percentage progress messages are not shown in this example.

  EXAMPLES                                                         12 October 1992


            The WINDOW command specifies the area of the triangulation that is  to
            be gridded into a DTI file.  There is only one restriction on the grid
            coverage allowed relative to the triangulation extent.  The  grid  DTM
            must  have  a  minimum  of 3 columns and 3 rows.  The user may specify
            that the grid DTM WINDOW extends beyond the  triangulation  area.   Of
            course  there  are  no  original  data points for interpolation in the
            resulting marginal areas and the proclivities of a  poorly  controlled
            mathematical surface may not truly represent the real world!

            If the user is unsure of the triangulation (X,Y) extent a SHOW  WINDOW
            command  will  supply this information assuming that the triangulation
            files have previously been opened with the FILEIN command.

            With the SIDELENGTH command the user has elected to  specify  explicit
            (X,Y)  DTM  inter-post  sidelengths rather than specify the WINDOW and
            then a definitive grid size.  TRIGRID calculates the DTM grid size  to
            be 241 rows and 151 columns.

            The SHOW commands enable the user to examine the current settings  for
            all  the TRIGRID run time options.  What the user has failed to notice
            from this listing is the fact that he has yet  to  specify  an  output
            file specification with the FILEOUT command.

            The user, believing that all is set up for this run, specifies the  GO
            command  to commence TRIGRID processing.  TRIGRID performs checks that
            all the obligatory commands  have  been  specified  and  discovers  an
            omission.   The  warning  message  indicates the 4 obligatory commands
            that must be issued before TRIGRID processing can be started.  The  GO
            command  is ignored.  As command input was from indirect command file,
            TRIGRID issues a further warning message, closes the indirect file and
            prompts for further commands at the terminal.

            The user, realising that he has not specified a FILEOUT  command,  now
            does so.  The missing parts from the file-spec supplied are taken from
            the default LSL$DTI:DTI.DTI;0.  Satisfied with this, he  reissues  the
            GO  command,  which is this time accepted.  TRIGRID processing begins.
            Messages indicating the start  of  each  major  processing  stage  are
            output.

            The warning that no projection information is available  for  the  DTI
            header  is  issued because TRIANG could find no projection information
            to  put  into  the  input  .NOD  and  .DTA  files  when  forming   the
            triangulation.   Input must have been from IFF files with unset type 2
            MDs (Map Descriptor) or DTI files without  projection  records.   This
            will  not  affect the TRIGRID run, but the DTI file header information
            should be  checked  carefully  and  the  DTI  file  projection  record
            possibly set up using DTITRANS.

            After opening the output DTI  file,  its  header  is  printed  to  the
            terminal.   From  this it is evident that the default file header type
            is 'LSLA' and the default DTI file post data type  is  word  (16  bit)
            integer.

            The  run  completed  successfully.   DCL  symbol  $STATUS  is  set  to
            SS$_NORMAL,  normal  successful  completion.   The DTM grid in the DTI
            file may now be viewed using DTIVIEW.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages may be generated  by  the  DTILIB
  library  and by the Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  DTILIB library messages are
  introduced by '%DTILIB' and are  documented  in  the  MATRIX  package  reference
  manual.   In most cases DTI errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this
  should be the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot  be
  traced by the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be
  preserved to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'
  and  are  generally  self-explanatory.   They are used to explain the details of
  program generated errors.

            DTMCREATE module graphics options are controlled by three lookup files
            which  are  accessed  via  logical  name  LSL$LOOKUP:   The  files are
            CONFIGURE.DAT,  CONFIGDEF.DAT  and  TERMTYPE.DAT.   The  logical  name
            LSL$LOOKUP defines a search list.  The search list is constructed such
            that a site dependent  directory  LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP]  will  be
            accessed          before          the         public         directory
            LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[DTMCREATE.LOOKUP].   On  delivery  of  the  DTMCREATE
            package  to  the  customer site, the lookup files will be contained in
            LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[DTMCREATE.LOOKUP]  and  the  lookup  files  will,  by
            default,  contain  definitions  for use with VAXstations only.  Should
            the user wish to modify the default definitions  files  supplied  with
            the    package,    the    files    should    first    be   copied   to
            LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP] with the command:

            $ [1mCOPY/LOG<CR>[0m
            _From: [1mLSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[DTMCREATE.LOOKUP]CONFIGDEF.DAT,[0m [1m-<CR>[0m
            _$ [1mCONFIGURE.DAT,TERMTYPE.DAT<CR>[0m
            _To: [1mLSL$LOOKUP:<CR>[0m

            This   will   have   the   effect   of   copying    the    files    to
            LSL$SITE_ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP].   The  user should then edit the copies of
            the files  to  make  them  site  dependent,  [1mNOT[0m  the  original  files
            contained  in LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[DTMCREATE.LOOKUP].  Failure to copy the
            files before editing them for the first time may result in the loss of
            any site dependent features of the files next time a DTMCREATE package
            upgrade is installed using the LAMPSINSTALL procedures.

            The copied lookup files may be changed using VAX/VMS EDIT at any  time
            to   allow   for  changes  in  serial  line  allocation  and  hardware
            availability.

            Graphics option records in the lookup files  are  referenced  via  the
            ident  of the serial line currently in use.  If the user has access to
            a terminal server, the serial line idents vary each time the user logs
            on,  even  at  the  same terminal.  To overcome this problem DTMCREATE
            uses the translation of a logical name, LSL$DTMCREATETERMINAL  as  the
            key  by which graphics lookup files are referenced.  This logical name
            is set up for the user whenever he logs onto a terminal  server  line.
            The logical name translates as "LTXX".  Records in the graphics lookup
            file are then referenced using "LTXX" instead  of  the  "real"  serial
            line  ident  e.g.   LTA125:.   If there is a terminal server in use at
            your site ensure that there is a record in the graphics  lookup  files
            for serial line "LTXX".  If there is no terminal server in use at your
            site logical name LSL$DTMCREATETERMINAL will not  be  defined,  unless
            you choose to explicitly do so.

            If a Tektronix 4000 or 4100 series or a SIGMEX 6100 series terminal is
            to  be  used,  ensure  that  logical  name LSL$TK is defined.  At most
            customer  sites  this  is  done  in  the  LITES2  initialisation  file
            LSL$COM:LITES2INI.COM.

            TRIANG, TRIDER and TRIGRID offer the user the option  to  display  the
            progress of their calculations on a graphics device.  The user must be
            logged on to the serial line associated with the  graphics  device  of
            his  choice.   If  a  graphics  option is selected the program opens a
            lookup file and  checks  that  the  current  serial  line  supports  a
            graphics  device.   If it does then the graphics device is initialised
            using routines appropriate to the type of graphics device described in
            the file.

            Currently supported graphics devices are:

            1.  T4010 - Tektronix 4010,

            2.  T4014 - Tektronix 4014,

            3.  T4100 - Tektronix 4100 series terminal,

            4.  S6100 - Sigmex 6100 series terminal

            5.  S7000 - Sigma ARGS 7000,

            6.  VT100 - able to clear screen only,

            7.  VAXstation

            8.  NONE - as it says (default),


            TRIANG   TRIDER   and   TRIGRID   share   the   same   lookup    file:
            LSL$LOOKUP:TERMTYPE.DAT

            The directory containing the lookup files is pointed to by the  system
            wide  logical name LSL$LOOKUP:.  The file is organised on the basis of
            the user's serial line identification.  The first stage of lookup file
            interrogation  is  to compare the current terminal line identification
            with the line idents (which are the first item on each  active  record
            of  the  lookup file).  If the serial line identification matches then
            the rest of the record of the lookup file is read.   The  lookup  file
            may  be changed using VAX/VMS EDIT at any time to allow for changes in
            serial line allocation and hardware availability.

            An example lookup file for TRIANG,TRIDER and TRIGRID is listed below:

            TRIEDIT uses a lookup file, LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGDEF.DAT,  to  select  and
            initialise  the  default  hardware  configuration  for your particular
            terminal line at your site.  Alternatively  you  may  specify  on  the
            startup  command  line  the  hardware options that you wish to use, or
            select hardware options (but not graphic screen type)  while  you  are
            running  the  program  by  using the ENABLE command.  If you choose to
            select your own  hardware  options  TRIEDIT  checks  in  another  site
            dependent  lookup  file,  LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGURE.DAT,  that  the desired
            options are available (and  are  in  a  valid  combination)  and  then
            initialises the devices accordingly.

            The contents of both the default hardware  configuration  lookup  file
            and the option configuration lookup file are organised on the basis of
            the users serial line identification.  The first stage of lookup  file
            interrogation  is  to compare the current terminal line identification
            with the line idents (which are the first item on each  active  record
            of  the  lookup file).  If the serial line identification matches then
            the rest of the record of the lookup file is read.

            Records in the lookup files may be in free format, option names  being
            separated by spaces.  A comment facility is available; any text to the
            right of a "!" is ignored.  The only restrictions to the layout of the
            files are:

            1.  The serial line identification must be the first item in a record.

            2.  All the options relating to one serial line must be  contained  on
                one line of the file
