  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the  workstation  dependent  facilities  available  when
  operating  DTMCREATE  on Digital VAXstation workstations.  It is to be read as a
  supplement to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual and in  particular  Appendix  A  of
  that manual.



  2  [1mDisplay[0m

  A single graphics display is supported, this may have either 4 or 8 planes.

  It is normal to login on the VAXstation by creating a new VT220  window,  but  a
  second  terminal  can  be used, in order to avoid having the alphanumeric window
  and the graphics window on the same screen.



  3  [1mShareable[0m [1mImages[0m

  All DTMCREATE utilities now use a shareable image  pointed  to  by  the  logical
  LSL$DTM_GHSSHR.    This  is  defined  by  DTMCREATEINI  to  point  to  an  image
  appropriate to the graphics device being used.  The  new  DTMCREATE  images  are
  LSL$EXE:DTM_GKSMOTIFSHR.EXE  for  MOTIF,  LSL$EXE:DTM_GKSUISSHR.EXE  for UIS and
  LSL$EXE:DTM_GKSNULLSHR.EXE for a non-graphical device.



  4  [1mInteractive[0m [1mdevices[0m

  In addition to the login  keyboard,  DTMCREATE  module  TRIEDIT  is  capable  of
  interpreting  commands  from  a digitising table on a separate terminal line, or
  the VAXstation mouse.



  4.1  [1mDigitising[0m [1mtable[0m

  The digitising table input is interpreted by DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT using  the
  Table Monitor system.

  To use the Table Monitor, a table monitor process must be started, using program
  STARTMON.    If   the   'named  monitor'  option  is  used,  then  logical  name
  LSL$MONITOR_TABLE must point to the serial line.  In addition, if the  table  is
  anything  other than a standard ALTEK, then logical table LSL$TABMON_ROUTINE (or
  LSL$TABMON_ROUTINE_<terminal> for  named  monitor)  must  point  to  a  suitable
  decoding  shareable  image.   This  logical  name must be available to the table
  monitor process, and so should be in the group or system logical name table.



  4.2  [1mGraphics[0m [1mInteraction[0m

  The DTMCREATE Reference Manual assumes by default that the user is logged onto a
  VAXstation.   It  is  assumed  that  when  running module TRIEDIT, GIN (Graphics
  INteraction) is via the VAXstation mouse or  bitpad.   The  DTMCREATE  Reference


  DTMCREATE - VAXstation (UIS/Motif) Workstation Guide                      Page 3


  Manual  refers  to  GIN  button presses in terms of "left", "middle" and "right"
  buttons, for "point", "master point" and "end" respectively.



  4.3  [1mKeyboard[0m

  If a VAXstation VT220 window is used as the login terminal,  keyboard  input  is
  taken  from  the  VAXstation  keyboard.   If  a  separate  VT100 (or equivalent)
  terminal is used as the login terminal, keyboard input  is  expected  from  that
  keyboard.

  DTMCREATE module graphics options are controlled by three lookup files which are
  accessed   via   logical   name   LSL$LOOKUP:    The  files  are  CONFIGURE.DAT,
  CONFIGDEF.DAT and TERMTYPE.DAT.  For details of the purpose and content of these
  files see Appendix A to the DTMCREATE Reference Manual.

  The lookup file TERMTYPE.DAT contains the graphics device  definition  for  each
  terminal line and is referenced by DTMCREATE modules TRIANG, TRIDER and TRIGRID.
  The following entries are required to enable use of TRIANG, TRIDER  and  TRIGRID
  on a VAXstation if a VT220 window is used as the login device:

  WTA1:           GPX
  WTA2:           GPX
  WTA3:           GPX
  WTA4:           GPX
  WTA5:           GPX
  WTA6:           GPX
  WTA7:           GPX
  WTA8:           GPX

  If a separate terminal is used as the login device, for example TTB3:  then  the
  following typical entry is needed:

  TTB3:   GPX

  DTMCREATE module TRIEDIT uses a lookup file, LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGDEF.DAT, to select
  and  initialise  the default hardware configuration for your particular terminal
  line at your site.  Alternatively you may specify on the  startup  command  line
  the  hardware  options that you wish to use, or select hardware options (but not
  graphic screen type) while you are running  the  program  by  using  the  ENABLE
  command.   If  you  choose to select your own hardware options TRIEDIT checks in
  another site dependent lookup file, LSL$LOOKUP:CONFIGURE.DAT, that  the  desired
  options  are available (and are in a valid combination) and then initialises the
  devices accordingly.

  Valid entries in either of the TRIEDIT graphics lookup files, for use  when  the
  login device is a VAXstation VT220 window are:

  WTA1:           GPX MOUSE 
  WTA2:           GPX MOUSE 
  WTA3:           GPX MOUSE 
  WTA4:           GPX MOUSE 


  DTMCREATE - VAXstation (UIS/Motif) Workstation Guide                      Page 4


  WTA5:           GPX MOUSE 
  WTA6:           GPX MOUSE 
  WTA7:           GPX MOUSE 
  WTA8:           GPX MOUSE 

  or:

  WTA1:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA2:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA3:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA4:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA5:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA6:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA7:           GPX TABLE 
  WTA8:           GPX TABLE 


  Additional entries must be made if additional terminal lines are to be used  for
  the login device, for example:

  TTB3:   GPX TABLE

  Note that for  TRIEDIT  graphical  interaction  MOUSE  and  TABLE  are  mutually
  exclusive.   No  other  GIN  (Graphics  INteraction)  options  are  allowed e.g.
  TRACKERBALL or THUMBWHEELS.
