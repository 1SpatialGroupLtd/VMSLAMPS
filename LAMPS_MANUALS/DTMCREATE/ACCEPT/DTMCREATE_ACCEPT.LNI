  1  [1mIntroduction[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan package
  DTMCREATE.

  DTMCREATE is a package of routines which  are  designed  to  create  grid  based
  digital  terrain models (DTMs).  The package consists of the mutually supportive
  modules TRIANG, TRIDER, TRIGRID and TRIEDIT.

  Data input to the DTMCREATE package is from  digitised  vector  data  stored  in
  Laser-Scan  IFF  (Internal Feature Format) files, and optionally from Laser-Scan
  DTI (Digital Terrain Image) DTM files for edge matching purposes.

  Note that Laser-Scan reserve the right  to  make  minor  modifications  to  this
  acceptance procedure to match their policy of continued software development.



  2  [1mOverview[0m

  For the purpose of acceptance, a Laser-Scan supplied DCL command procedure  will
  be  used  to  invoke  the  programs  of  the DTMCREATE package.  The DCL command
  procedure will emulate a typical flowline sequence to produce terrain models  in
  DTI  format  from  IFF  vector  data.   Heighted vector data is supplied for the
  acceptance tests.

  The input data will consist of heighted contour  strings,  spot  heights  and  a
  portion  of  an existing DTI format DTM.  The vector data will be differentiated
  by IFF layer number and feature code into geomorphological  feature  types  e.g.
  rivers  and ridgelines.  The river and ridgeline data result from pre-processing
  by the DTMPREPARE package.  Vectors defining areas of  standing  water  will  be
  included  in  the  data area to illustrate that flat surfaces can be honoured by
  DTMCREATE by the use of breaklines.

  Check  that  the  Laser-Scan-supplied  package   initialisation   command   file
  LSL$COM:DTMCREATEINI.COM   has  been  invoked.   This  has  probably  been  done
  automatically on your behalf at login time.  A good check  is  to  use  the  DCL
  command:

          $ SHOW SYMBOL TRIGRID

  to verify that the DCL symbol TRIGRID exists and points  to  the  program  image
  file of a main DTMCREATE module "LSL$EXE:TRIGRID.EXE".  If symbol TRIGRID is not
  defined then invoke the package initialisation command file by  giving  the  DCL
  command:

          $ @LSL$COM:DTMCREATEINI

  then repeat the check for the existence of DCL symbol TRIGRID.

  Use the DCL SHOW LOGICAL command to ensure that logical name LSL$IF points to  a
  suitable  working  directory  to receive the acceptance test IFF files.  If not,
  then use the SI utility to set LSL$IF appropriately.

  The acceptance test command procedure  will  check  for  the  existence  of  the
  required  acceptance  test data files in their usual directory on the Laser-Scan
  software  distribution  directory  tree.   It  will  set  up  a   logical   name
  LSL$DTMCREATE_ACCEPT  to point to this directory.  It will also copy the initial
  IFF data file into the working directory pointed at by LSL$IF.

  Invoke the acceptance test command procedure by giving the DCL command

          $ @LSL$COM:DTMCREATE_ACCEPT



  5  [1mDescription of Acceptance Procedure[0m

  You will be asked if you are using a VAXstation/GPX screen.  Answer Yes to  this
  question  if  you  are  on  a VAXstation running either a VWS or MOTIF windowing
  system.  If you answer No to this question the procedure  will  assume  you  are
  using a Sigmex ARGS 7000.

  You will also be asked if you are using a 4 plane graphics screen.   You  should
  answer  No  to this if you are using a normal 8 plane graphics screen.  You will
  now be ready for the acceptance tests.

  The first stage in the acceptance  procedure  demonstrates  the  module  TRIANG.
  TRIANG  is  utilised to generate a modified Delaunay triangulation which defines
  spatial relationships between all relevant data nodes taken from the source  IFF
  vector and DTI files.

  In the interests of processing speed, the size of the DTMCREATE acceptance  test
  data set is reduced by use of the TRIANG windowing facility.

  The facilities  available  in  TRIANG  to  selectively  assign  geomorphological
  feature  type  flags  to  incoming  data  will  be  demonstrated.   Data will be
  extracted from an existing DTI format DTM file and included in the triangulation
  to  illustrate  this  powerful  DTM  edge  matching  feature.  Constraint of the
  triangulation to source contour strings  will  be  illustrated  by  use  of  the
  optional  graphics  facility.   At  the  end  of processing, the triangular data
  structure will be output to two binary transfer files.  A  message  "writing  to
  .NOD and .DTA files" will be seen.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The DTMCREATE triangulation editor, TRIEDIT  will  be  used  to  illustrate  the
  nature  of  the  triangulation and to indicate the value of the geomorphological
  data flags generated by TRIANG.  The two binary transfer files created by TRIANG
  will  be  used  as input to TRIEDIT.  The editor will enable the user to examine
  the characteristics of individual data nodes and whole data strings.  Data  edit
  and  insertion  facilities  will  be  demonstrated.   Within  the  scope  of the
  acceptance tests no triangulation edits will be saved for later use.

  The following commands should be typed interactively to illustrate  the  correct
  functioning of the editor:

           Press the rightmost function button.

      31.  DELETE - to delete a whole string  of  nodes  from  the  triangulation.
           Type  the  DELETE  command  and  position the cursor over a node in the
           string that you wish to delete.  Press the rightmost function button.

      32.  CLEAR - to clear the screen, as the triangles redraw the results of the
           deletion will be apparent.

      33.  QUIT - end the edit session without saving any edits.


                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The next stage in the acceptance test will  illustrate  the  use  of  the  slope
  derivative  estimation  module  TRIDER.   TRIDER  not only estimates first order
  slope derivatives, but also heights for  boundary  nodes  and  the  coefficients
  which  define  local  surface  patches.  Input to TRIDER will consist of the two
  binary data structure files created by TRIANG.  The optional  graphics  facility
  will  be  used  to  indicate  the  progress  of  data processing.  At the end of
  processing, the first order slope derivatives and coefficients  used  to  define
  the surface patch will be output to a binary transfer file.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  At this stage of the acceptance tests, the three binary transfer  files  created
  by  TRIANG  and  TRIDER  will  contain  all  the data needed to define a terrain
  surface.  The acceptance tests continue with TRIGRID, which will  interpolate  a
  grid  based  DTM  from the triangulation data held in the binary transfer files.
  One half of the triangulation data area will be selected by use of  the  TRIGRID
  windowing  facility.  User defined geometric and geomorphological limits to grid
  interpolation will be demonstrated.  The optional graphics facility will be used
  to  indicate  the  progress  of  data processing.  At the end of processing, the
  completed grid based DTM will be output to a DTI format file.

  The TRIGRID acceptance test will  be  repeated,  this  time  using  the  TRIGRID
  windowing  facility  to  select  that portion of the triangulation data area not
  processed in the previous TRIGRID test.  At the end of processing the  completed
  grid based DTM will be output to a DTI format file.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The MATRIX package utility DTITILE will be used to join  together  the  two  DTI
  format  DTMs  produced  by TRIGRID.  Together these two DTI files contain a grid
  based DTM for the whole area defined by the TRIANG window specification.

  The MATRIX package utility DTIVIEW will then be  used  to  produce  4  isometric
  views  of both the north and south half DTM files and also the whole area DTM to
  show correct generation of the terrain model.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  The DTMCREATE acceptance tests will now be complete.
