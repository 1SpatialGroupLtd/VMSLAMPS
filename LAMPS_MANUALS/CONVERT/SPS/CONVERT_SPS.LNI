  1  [3m[1mDESCRIPTION[0m

  CONVERT is the Laser-Scan map data translation package.  It contains modules  to
  convert data from IFF to other formats, and/or from those formats into IFF.

  IFF stands for [1mI[0mnternal [1mF[0meature [1mF[0mormat and is the Laser-Scan vector file  format
  generated  by  LASERAID  and other Laser-Scan digitising systems and used as the
  data structure throughout the Laser-Scan  LAMPS  system.   The  CONVERT  package
  allows  the user to translate data captured with LAMPS ([1mL[0maser-Scan [1mA[0mutomated [1mM[0map
  [1mP[0mroduction [1mS[0mystem) into another form for output, or to convert data  from  other
  systems into IFF for manipulation within LAMPS.

  The CONVERT package operates on Digital  Equipment  VAX  and  Alpha  AXP  series
  computers running the VMS operating system.  See below for hardware and software
  prerequisites.

  This document briefly describes the utilities available in all of the modules in
  the  CONVERT package.  In most circumstances, however, a customer will only have
  purchased some of the modules within the package - those for which that site has
  an  actual  requirement.   Thus  the  presence  of  a module description in this
  document does not mean that the module is available at a particular site.

  All the utilities have common command syntax which is decoded using the  Command
  Line  Interpreter  as used by the VMS utilities.  CONVERT utilities all generate
  VMS format messages and set VMS DCL symbol $STATUS on image  exit.   In  command
  files  the  success  of  a preceding CONVERT utility may be tested using $STATUS
  before proceeding.   All  CONVERT  modules  and  utilities  are  comprehensively
  documented  in  the  CONVERT  User  Guide  and  the  documentation  includes  an
  explanation of messages output by  the  modules  together  with  suggested  user
  action.



  2  [3m[1mFACILITIES[0m

  The  facilities  offered  by  the  CONVERT  modules  are  described   below   in
  alphabetical  order  of module.  Note that customers purchase particular modules
  as required, so that the presence of a module within this  list  does  not  mean
  that a customer will automatically receive that module.



  [1m*[0m [1mIFFARCINFO[0m (Support for ESRI ARC/INFO)

          IFFARCINFO provides support for the transfer of  data  to  the  ARC/INFO
          uncompressed  ASCII  version  of  their  EXPORT  format  defined  by the
          Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) of Redlands, California.
          The utilities provided are:

           o  ARC2I - reads an uncompressed ASCII ARC/INFO EXPORT file on tape  or
              disk  and  creates  an IFF disk file.  Attributes may be included in
              the translation by means of parameter file to describe the attribute
              names.   This  utility  can  only  read  the  standard .AAT and .PAT
              attribute tables and will ignore the .IAC and .RAC attribute  tables
              produced  by I2ARC.  The program has the ability to read version 6.0
              text features but not their corresponding attributes.

           o  I2ARC - reads an IFF file and outputs the data to an ARC/INFO EXPORT
              format  disc file.  Attribute information can be put in the .IAC and
              .RAC tables by default or in the .AAT  and  .PAT  standard  ARC/INFO
              tables by using the parameter file mechanism.  Text features are not
              output in version 6.0 form but in the form previous to this  version
              of ARC/INFO.




  [1m*[0m [1mIFFCEDD[0m (Support for IHO CEDD)

          IFFCEDD provides support for the production and reading of CEDD data  as
          defined  in the document [1mFormat[0m [1mfor[0m [1mthe[0m [1mExchange[0m [1mof[0m [1mDigital[0m [1mHydrographic[0m
          [1mData[0m, published by the International  Hydrographic  Organisation  (IHO),
          Committee  on  the  Exchange  of  Digital Data (CEDD), November 1986 The
          utilities provided are:

           o  I2CEDD - reads an IFF  file  and  outputs  CEDD  formatted  data  to
              magnetic  tape  or  disk.   Only  the  sequential  form  of  CEDD is
              supported.

           o  CEDD2I - reads CEDD formatted data from magnetic tape  or  disk  and
              outputs  an IFF file.  Either sequential or chain-node forms of CEDD
              can be read, but in the latter  case,  the  structure  will  not  be
              maintained in the IFF file.




  [1m*[0m [1mIFFDCW[0m (Support for the Digital Chart of the World)

          IFFDCW provides support for the creation of IFF files from Digital Chart
          of  the  World  CD-ROM  data  defined  in  the DCW Product Specification
          (MIL-D-89009) available from the Defence Mapping Agency (DMA).   DCW  is
          based  on the Vector Product Format (MIL-STD-600006) also available from
          DMA.  The utilities provided are:

           o  DCW2I - will read the DCW CD-ROMs containing VPF database tables and
              create  IFF files for each tile of each coverage in a library, based
              on the selections made.

              DCW2I has large resource requirements which  should  be  taken  into
              consideration   before   attempting   to   perform  the  conversion.
              Recommendations for the use of DCW2I are as follows:

               o  As  the  program  is  very  computationally  expensive,  a  high
                  performance  workstation  or  server is recommended although not
                  essential.

               o  The minimum page file quota for the machine should be  at  least
                  150Mb to ensure trouble-free conversion of all coverages.

               o  Allow approximately 2Mb of disk space for the storage of all IFF
                  files  that  will  be  generated from the 4 CD-ROMs covering the
                  world.

               o  Due to errors  in  the  DCW  data  the  conversion  process  may
                  encounter  some  problems  when  creating  IFF area features and
                  these require manual checking in LITES2.





  [1m*[0m [1mIFFDIGIT[0m (Support for Scitex DIGIT)

          IFFDIGIT provides the production of Scitex DIGIT data  as  supported  on
          Scitex  operating  system  version  6.9.2.   Only DIGIT file type 310 is
          supported.  The utilities provided are:

           o  I2DIGIT - reads an IFF file and  outputs  DIGIT  formatted  data  to
              magnetic tape only.

          of 1986 (Department of the Interior, U.S.  Geological  Survey,  National
          Mapping  Division).   Optional DLG is not supported by this module.  The
          utility provided is:

           o  I2DLG - reads an IFF file and outputs either  to  magnetic  tape  or
              disc in Standard DLG Distribution format at Level 3.




  [1m*[0m [1mIFFDXF[0m (Support for Auto-CAD [1mD[0migital e[1mX[0mchange [1mF[0mormat)

          IFFDXF provides support for the transfer of data to and from  ASCII  DXF
          format, as described in Appendix C of the Auto-CAD manual.  However, DXF
          files to be converted to IFF must contain no more than 16  levels.   The
          graphic  portrayal  of  symbols is not honoured by conversion of data in
          either direction.  The utilities provided are:

           o  DXF2I - reads DXF as input and produces an IFF file as output.

           o  I2DXF - reads IFF as input and produces a DXF file as output.

  [1m*[0m [1mIFFNTF[0m (Support for NTF v1.1 and 2.0 (BS7567), levels 1, 2 & 3 and CITF 1.0)

          IFFNTF provides support for  the  production  and  reading  of  [1mN[0mational
          [1mT[0mransfer  [1mF[0mormat (NTF) data.  NTF is the UK National Transfer Format for
          spatially referenced data.  Currently,  only  levels  1,  2  and  3  are
          supported  at  version  1.1  but  with some restrictions at version 2.0.
          Also supported is the conversion of Ordnance Survey  CITF  data  version
          1.0 based on NTF level 5 version 2.0.

          At level 1, the only attributes (values) recognised are orientation (OR)
          and  height  (HT).   At levels 2 and 3 , full attribute transfer (except
          for per-point attributes) is possible in both directions.  The utilities
          provided are:

           o  I2NTF - reads a series of IFF files, each containing  a  single  map
              sheet, and outputs NTF or CITF data to file or magnetic tape.  Three
              dimensional coordinate data may be output, but per point  attributes
              are  not  supported.  At level 3, structured IFF files can be output
              to NTF (this includes link and node data and  complex  objects,  but
              excludes polygons).  I2NTF is also able to change feature codes on a
              one-to-one basis during conversion, through the  use  of  a  feature
              code conversion lookup table.

           o  NTF2I - reads NTF or CITF data  from  magnetic  tape  or  file,  and
              outputs a series of IFF files.  Three dimensional data and per point
              attributes are supported only for CITF.  Although NTF level  3  data
              can  be  read,  any structure information will not be present in the
              IFF file produced.  NTF2I will read Ordnance Survey NTF version  2.0
              Landline,  OSCAR,  1:625000,  1:250000  and  1:50000  (contour) data
              products.  As NTF2I will currently not read CHAIN, POLYGON,  COMPLEX
              POLYGON  and  COLLECT  records at NTF v2.0 it will not read Ordnance
              Survey's Boundary-Line data.  NTF2I is also able to  change  feature
              codes  on a one-to-one basis during conversion, through the use of a
              feature code conversion lookup table.

          IFFOSTF provides support for the production and reading  of  OSTF  data.
          OSTF  is  the  [1mO[0mrdnance  [1mS[0murvey  [1mT[0mransfer  [1mF[0mormat, and is sometimes also
          called DMC ([1mD[0migital [1mM[0mapping [1mC[0mustomer format).   The  utilities  provided
          are:

           o  I2OSTF - reads a series of IFF files, each  containing  an  Ordnance
              Survey  (OS)  style  map,  and  outputs  OSTF format data to file or
              magnetic tape.

           o  OSTF2I - reads input data on magnetic tape or from disk, in  OS  DMC
              or  OSTF formats, and produces an IFF file for each map sheet in the
              input data.

           o  OSMHED - edits an Ordnance  Survey  style  map  header.   Individual
              fields  in  the header can be edited either sequentially by stepping
              through them, or explicitly through the use of simple commands.  The
              program also has its own built in help facility.

           o  OSPIF  - prints out the contents of an IFF file in  summary  format.
              The  information  produced  includes  the identity of the map sheet,
              feature codes and descriptions, texts, and start and end  points  of
              each feature.

          of 12-May-1985 (Intergraph document DIXD4110).  The binary SIF format is
          not supported.  The utilities provided are:

           o  IFF2SIF - reads IFF data as input, and outputs  to  the  ASCII  text
              form  of  SIF.   An  option in IFF2SIF also provides support for the
              SCITEX version of SIF.

           o  SIF2IFF - reads the ASCII text form of SIF as input, and outputs IFF

  [1m*[0m [1mIFFTDST[0m (Support for SysScan ASCII DST)

          IFFTDST provides support for the production and  reading  of  the  ASCII
          text  form  of  DST,  as  described  in the document [1mGINIS[0m [1mI/O[0m [1mReference[0m
          [1mManual[0m [1m(4.1)[0m of March-1988 (SysScan document RM-025).  DST is  the  file
          extension  used by SysScan to identify GINIS data files, their main data
          format.  TDST is the term  used  by  Laser-Scan  to  describe  SysScan's
          otherwise unnamed ASCII version of DST.  The utilities provided are:

           o  I2TDST - outputs IFF data to ASCII DST.

           o  TDST2I - reads ASCII DST as  input  and  produces  an  IFF  file  as
              output.




  [1m*[0m [1mLSLIMI[0m (Laser-Scan Informap Interface)

          LSLIMI consists of a translation menu interface which allows the user to
          read  data  from  magnetic tape or disk file into Informap, and to write
          from Informap to tape or file, the following formats:

           o  OSTF - the OS transfer format, sometimes also called DMC

           o  NTF  - the UK National Transfer Format for spatially referenced data

          The menu system allows the user  to  specify  what  is  to  be  read  or
          written, and then runs the appropriate programs.

          Modules IFFIMAP, IFFOSTF and IFFNTF are prerequisites.

          LSLIMI is intended for a system running Informap, and does not require a
          standard Laser-Scan LAMPS environment.

  3.1  [3m[1mComputer[0m [3m[1mHardware[0m [3m[1mPrerequisites[0m

  The following computer hardware requirements are needed to run CONVERT.

        *  Any DEC VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or Alpha AXP computer  supported  by
           the current version of VMS.

        *  At least 10MB available disc space for software,  plus  sufficient  for
           data files.

        *  Any DEC-compatible alphanumeric terminal.

        *  Any DEC-supported magnetic tape or cartridge tape drive

        *  At least a 4096 pages working set per process is needed  for  efficient
           operation of the larger utilities.




  3.2  [3m[1mSoftware[0m [3m[1mPrerequisites[0m

  CONVERT utilities run under OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2, or OpenVMS AXP  V1.5  (or
  higher,   assuming   upwards  compatibility  by  DEC)  concurrently  with  other
  interactive and batch processes.

  Laser-Scan provides  the  IFF  and  FRT  interface  libraries  as  part  of  the
  prerequisite MAPPING support package.  The IMP map processing package is usually
  used for  preliminary  map  processing  associated  with  the  CONVERT  package.
  Laser-Scan's  LITES2  interactive digitising and editing software running on the
  same host computer is recommended for digitising vector input data.  LASERAID or
  VTRAK automated digitising is recommended for large numbers of input documents.

  It is recommended that the reader becomes familiar with  the  LAMPS  Environment
  Guide  which  outlines  in  greater detail the hardware and software environment
  required by the LAMPS software suite as a whole (of which the CONVERT package is
  one part).
