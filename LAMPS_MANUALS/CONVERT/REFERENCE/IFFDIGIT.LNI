            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            RESTRICTIONS        - a summary of restrictions on the use of

            EXAMPLES            - annotated examples of utility useage.

            MESSAGES            - all classes of message are listed and described
                                  and suggested user action given. The messages
                                  are divided into sections according to message
                                  severity within which the messages are ordered
                                  alphabetically by message mnemonic.

            This section  describes  the  DIGIT  format  created  by  the  I2DIGIT
            utility.   An  important  fact to note is that the actual DIGIT format
            will be written to tape with adjacent bytes reversed.  This is because
            the  VAX  is  a  'little-endian'  machine  and  Hewlett  Packards  are
            'big-endian' which means that their byte orders are opposite  to  each
            other.  The format is described here as it would appear on the VAX for
            clarity and the actual DIGIT tape will contain a  file  that  has  the
            same structure but the values will look very different.

            A DIGIT file is divided into groups of 128 words called  sectors.   As
            all  coordinates  are held in word format, this means the range of the
            map can only be 1 to 32767.  This may clearly cause rounding  problems
            when  creating  DIGIT  files  from  IFF  which  uses  a floating point
            representation for  coordinates  and  so  appropriate  scaling  values
            should be used to provide maximum resolution.

            Another important factor to know about DIGIT is that  the  coordinates
            are  held  as height followed by width which equates to (Y,X) and with
            the Y (height) coordinates inverted.  (ie the origin  is  in  the  top
            left corner).

            The DIGIT format does not hold text information  and  is  only  geared
            towards lines and arcs.  Point features can be represented in DIGIT as
            2 point line features with coincident end points.

            The tape based DIGIT format created by I2DIGIT is written in blocks of
            6144  words  (12288  bytes) and each block therefore holds 48 sectors.
            The end of a block not used is padded out with zeros.

            The first sector is the File Header sector which contains  information
            about  the  whole file.  The file is divided into partitions which are
            collections of lines and may consist of any number of sectors.

            The file header record looks as follows:

            The first record (8 words) in the sector are:


                 1)  File type - which will always be 310 for DIGIT files.

                 2)  File size - which is the number of sectors in the file.

                 3)  Number of  header  sectors  -  the  header  sector  can  hold
                     references  to 15 partitions.  Any additional partitions will
                     overflow into another header sector.  This will usually be 1.

                 4)  Number of partitions - this will be one for files created  by
                     I2DIGIT.

                 5)  Location of first directory - always 9 since it points to the
                     9th  word  in  the header sector where the first partition is
                     described.

               6-8)  unused and should contain zeros.


            Records 2-16 contain a directory of all the partitions  in  the  file.
            The words in each of these records are defined as:


               1-5)  Partition name - contains a 10  character  name  padded  with
                     blanks  as  necessary.  The values are the decimal equivalent
                     of adjacent pairs of ASCII characters.

                 6)  Partition  start  sector  -  the  sector  number  where  each
                     partition starts.

                 7)  Partition size - the extent of each partition in sectors.

                 8)  Unused and should contain zeros.


            Following the header sector is the partition data which  may  consists
            of  up  to  32767  sectors.   The first two records (16 words) contain
            information about the whole partition.  Here is part of some partition
            data showing the first 16 words and part of a feature.

            The partition header has words 1 to 16 defined thus:


               1-5)  Partition name - same name as held in the  directory  in  the
                     file header

                 6)  Maximum Y value

                 7)  Maximum X value

                 8)  Resolution in points per millimetre

                 9)  Minimum Y value - taken from /OFFSET value

                10)  Minimum X value - taken from /OFFSET value

                11)  Maximum Y value

                12)  Maximum X value

             13-16)  Unused and should contain zeros.


            After the partition header are the features denoted by line codes  and
            coordinates.   The negative values are the line codes and the positive
            ones are the feature coordinates (in Y,X order).


            The line codes are described below:


                 Code name        Value      Description

            The START LINE code is compulsory and requires  no  parameters.   When
            other  codes  require  parameters  they  are  followed  by  the  codes
            representing the digits  making  the  numbers.   So,  for  example,  a
            feature  with  a Font Type of 502 would have the codes -32736, -32724,
            -32729 and -32727 since -32736 is the  code  for  the  FONT  TYPE  and
            -32736,  -32729  and  -32727  are  the  codes  for  digits  5, 0 and 2
            respectively.  A list of codes representing digits 0 to  9  are  given
            below.


                  Digit   0       -32729          Colour  1       -32766
                  Digit   1       -32728          Colour  2       -32765
                  Digit   2       -32727          Colour  3       -32764
                  Digit   3       -32726          Colour  4       -32763
                  Digit   4       -32725          Colour  5       -32762
                  Digit   5       -32724          Colour  6       -32761
                  Digit   6       -32723          Colour  7       -32760
                  Digit   7       -32722          Colour  8       -32759
                  Digit   8       -32721          Colour  9       -32758
                  Digit   9       -32720          Colour  10      -32757
                                                  Colour  11      -32756
                                                  Colour  12      -32755


            Also shown are the single colour numbers that may be attributed  to  a
            feature.   These  do not follow a code but appear anywhere in the code
            description at the beginning of a line, but not between a code and its
            parameter.

            Codes CURVE TYPE, TERMINATION and PRIORITY have the same code (-32737)
            with  parameters  1  to  9  and  these  parameters  appear in the file
            represented by there own codes.  For  example,  a  feature  with  high
            priority  will  have  the code sequence -32737, -32721 since -32721 is
            the representation of digit 8 which  is  used  to  denote  the  'high'
            option associated with PRIORITY.

            Feature characteristics assigned to a feature remain in effect (ie for
            all following features) until other codes are found which change them.
            The only exception to this is the Closed  parameter  which  should  be
            present on each line it applies to.

            IFF is a feature orientated data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            The DIGIT format shares this concept  of  a  'feature'  but  does  not
            identify  features  uniquely  as  there  is  not provision for feature
            serial numbers.  I2DIGIT will write the whole file into one  partition
            containing  features  which  can have upto six characteristics.  These
            characteristics are defined in the FORMAT DESCRIPTION section.

            When converting from IFF to DIGIT, it is  not  possible  to  translate
            fully  some  IFF  graphical  types.   In  fact the only features to be
            translated exactly are linear features with GT 1 consisting simply  of
            a string of coordinates.

            Arcs, circles and interpolated curves (GTs 2, 3, 4,  5,  6)  have  the
            points  output directly from the ST entry and do not have their points
            created.  The parameter file should be used to give these features the
            appropriate flag.  (ie cubic or parabolic).

            All symbol features (GT 7,8 and 9) are output as lines of 2 pixels  in
            length so that the Scitex VTR operation will recognise them.

            All text features (GT 10) are ignored.

            Area fill features (GT 12) will not be automatically output  with  the
            relevant  closed  flag  present.  This must be done explicitly via the
            parameter file.

            This  file  contains  the  information  needed  when  translating  IFF
            features  into  DIGIT  features by associating certain characteristics
            with  IFF  feature  codes.   This  is  essential  for  the  successful
            conversion  of  IFF  features  into  DIGIT  ones.   Optional  commands
            identical to certain command line qualifiers may also be  put  in  the
            table.   The  parameter  file  contains  various  commands and a table
            section as described below :

  DATA PREPARATION                                               22 September 1992


            [1mOptional[0m [1mParameter[0m [1mCommands[0m

            There are a number of commands which may be included in the  parameter
            file  rather  than  on  the  command  line as qualifiers.  The command
            should begin the line but not  include  the  backslash  ('/')  and  be
            followed by the appropriate value(s).

            If the same command is given in the parameter file and on the  command
            line  as  a  qualifier,  then the qualifier value will be used.  If no
            command is given at all where one is required, a default value will be
            used.  The default values are documented with each qualifier.

            The available commands are BORDER, OFFSET,  RESOLUTION,  SCALE_FACTOR,
            SCALE_IFF,  SCALE_SHEET, XMIN, XMAX, YMIN and YMAX which are identical
            to the qualifiers of the same names.  Refer  to  the  I2DIGIT  COMMAND
            QUALIFIERS section for a description of each qualifier.

            See the sample parameter file below  for  examples  of  the  available
            commands.

            [1mThe[0m [1mDIGIT[0m [1mTranslation[0m [1mTable[0m

            Each line of the table is prefixed with a command which identifies the
            line  as  belonging  to that table.  The lines are free-format, so the
            order of entries matters, but the actual position of  entries  on  the
            line  is  not  important.  Any text starting with the "!" character is
            regarded as a comment, and is ignored.  Comments  can  appear  on  the
            same  lines as commands, or on separate lines.  Note that commands may
            be in upper or lower case.

            The DIGIT translation table describes  the  translations  required  to
            produce   DIGIT   feature  characteristics  from  IFF  features.   The
            characteristics are described below.  Each line is prefixed  with  the
            'DIGIT' command which tells the program that the line in the parameter
            file is part of the translation table.
            A line in the parameter file has the form :-

                 [1mDIGIT   fc   font   line   curve   term   prio   col[0m

            where the fields are :-

                 [1mDIGIT  [0m- the command DIGIT which states  that  this  line  is  an
                          entry in the DIGIT translation table.

                 [1mfc     [0m- the feature code  in  the  IFF  file  to  be  given  the
                          following  DIGIT characteristics.  This should be in the
                          range 1-32767.

                 [1mfont   [0m- the DIGIT font number in the range 0-999.   However  the
                          value may be -1 to denote it is undefined, in which case
                          it will not appear with this feature in the DIGIT file.

                 [1mline   [0m- the DIGIT line width in the  range  1-99.   However  the
                          value may be -1 to denote it is undefined, in which case
                          it will not appear with this feature in the DIGIT file.

                 [1mcurve  [0m- the DIGIT curve type  number  in  the  range  1-3.   The
                          values of these represent the following curve types:

                                     1) - Linear
                                     2) - Parabolic
                                     3) - Cubic

                          The curve type may be -1 to denote it is  undefined,  in
                          which  case  it will not appear with this feature in the
                          DIGIT file.

                 [1mterm   [0m- the DIGIT termination number and may be 4, 5 or 9.   The
                          values of these represent the following terminations:

                                     4) - Open/Straight
                                     5) - Closed
                                     9) - Open/Round Ends

                          The termination may be -1 to denote it is undefined,  in
                          which  case  it will not appear with this feature in the
                          DIGIT file.

                 [1mprio   [0m- the DIGIT line priority in the range 6-8.  The values of
                          these represent the following priorities:

                                     6) - Low
                                     7) - Normal
                                     8) - High

                          The priority may be -1 to denote  it  is  undefined,  in
                          which  case  it will not appear with this feature in the
                          DIGIT file.

                 [1mcol    [0m- the DIGIT line colour in the range 1-12.  This value may
                          be  -1  to denote it as undefined, in which case it will
                          not appear with this feature in the DIGIT file.

  [1mPARAMETERS[0m

  Input-IFF-file

          - This parameter specifies the name of an IFF file, and  is  compulsory.
            The  data written to the output file is read from this file.  Only one
            filename may be specified for each run of the program.
            The default device and extension LSL$IF:IFF.IFF  are  applied  to  the
            input file specification when it is parsed.

  Output-device-name

          - This parameter specifies the name of the magnetic  tape  device  name,
            and  is  compulsory.   The  device  often  has  a  four character name
            followed by a colon, (eg MUB1:) and must have been previously  mounted

  [1mCOMMAND[0m [1mQUALIFIERS[0m


  /APPEND
  /NOAPPEND (default)

          - The default action of I2DIGIT is to initialise a tape by rewinding  it
            and  writing  the  DIGIT  file  from  the  beginning.  When /APPEND is
            present, the utility will search the tape for  an  end-of-volume  mark
            which  is denoted by two consecutive tape marks.  The device head will
            be left positioned between the two marks so that when  the  new  DIGIT
            file  is  written,  it will overwrite the second take mark leaving one
            mark separating the last tape file with the  new  one.   I2DIGIT  will
            always  write  two  tape  marks  after the DIGIT file.  Thus, by using
            /APPEND, it is possible to create a tape containing many  DIGIT  files
            separated  by  single  tape marks with a double tape mark denoting the
            end-of-volume.


  /BORDER=integer

          - this qualifier is used to create a border around  the  map  extent  so
            that  thick lines which lay exactly along an edge will not be clipped.
            The integer value to be given should  be  in  DIGIT  pixels  and  will
            default  to  zero.   The  border  is  available  as  a  command in the
            parameter file, but the qualifier value will take precedence.


  /FC=(integer[,...])

          - causes I2DIGIT to output  only  those  IFF  features  which  have  the
            specified  feature  code(s) and which lie in the layers selected using
            /LAYER.  The /FC qualifier will accept single, multiple or  ranges  of
            feature  code  arguments.   Ranges  may be specified with starting and
            ending feature codes that  are  separated  by  a  colon,  for  example
            /FC=56:58.   When  specifying  more  than  one range of feature codes,
            separate each range with a comma, for example /FC=(1:5,56:89,95).  The
            maximum  number  of  feature codes which may be specified is 1024.  If
            the qualifier is not given, then all features will be translated.


  /LAYER=(integer[,...])

          - causes I2DIGIT to output only those feature which are in the specified
            layers and in the range specified with /FC.  The /LAYER qualifier will
            accept single, multiple or ranges of layer arguments.  Ranges  may  be
            specified with starting and ending layer numbers that are separated by
            a colon, for example /LAYER=0:3.  When specifying more than one  range
            of   layers,   separate   each   range   with  a  comma,  for  example
            /LAYER=(0:2,4:5).  The maximum number of layers which may be specified
            is  1024.   If  the  qualifier  is  not given, then all layers will be
            translated.

  /LOG
  /NOLOG (default)

          - When /LOG is present,  the  I2DIGIT  utility  will  output  diagnostic
            messages about any file creation or deletion as it processes the input
            IFF file so that any errors may be traced.


  /OFFSET=(integer,integer)

          - this qualifier is used to shift the DIGIT coordinates by a  number  of
            pixels  in  x  and  y respectively, and should be used when the origin
            lies inside the map (ie the IFF file contains  negative  coordinates).
            If the IFF coordinates are negative and no offset is given, the output
            DIGIT coordinates may fall outside the range 1 to 32767 which  is  not
            permitted  and will cause the program to exit.  The values to be given
            should be in DIGIT pixels and will default to 1 in the X direction and
            1  in  the Y direction (1,1).  The offset is available as a command in
            the parameter file, but the qualifier values will take precedence.


  /PARAMETER=file-spec

          - This qualifier is compulsory and specifies  the  IFF  parameter  file,
            which  defines  the transformation of feature codes in the IFF data to
            data types in the DIGIT file.  Refer to the DATA  PREPARATION  section
            for details of the parameter file entries and their ranges.


  /PARTITION_NAME=string

          - specifies the name to be used for the partition which will be  written
            to the partition header.  There is space for only 10 characters in the
            header and so the string will be  truncated  if  it  is  longer.   The
            truncated name will be reported to the user.  The string should not be
            enclosed in quotes, but if it is they  will  be  removed.   Characters
            permitted  in  the  partition  name  string must be alphabetic for the
            first character and alphabetic or numeric for the remainder.


  /RESOLUTION=integer

          - specifies the resolution of the DIGIT data in  points  per  millimetre
            which  is  used  in  the  formula  described below.  The resolution is
            available as a command in the parameter file, but the qualifier  value
            will take precedence.  The default value is 32 points per millimetre.


  /SCALE_FACTOR=real

          - this qualifier should  be  used  instead  of  the  default  qualifiers
            /SCALE_IFF  and  /SCALE_SHEET and is intended for use when the file is
            held in sheet units.  It is used to define  the  number  of  sheet  mm
            represented  by  1  IFF  file  unit  and if given with no number, will
            default to 1.0.  If no scale qualifiers or  commands  are  given,  the
            default  action  by  the  program  is  to  use  the  default values of

            /SCALE_IFF and /SCALE_SHEET.  This qualifier is available as a command
            in the parameter file, but the qualifier value will take precedence.


  /SCALE_IFF=real

          - this qualifier should be used together with /SCALE_SHEET  and  defines
            the  number of ground mm represented by 1 IFF file unit.  If it is not
            given, it will default  to  1000  since  it  is  usual  that  the  IFF
            coordinates  will  be held in metres.  It is available as a command in
            the parameter file, but the qualifier value will take precedence.


  /SCALE_SHEET=real

          - this qualifier should be used together with /SCALE_IFF and defines the
            number  of  ground units represented by 1 sheet unit.  (eg 50000 for a
            1:50000 sheet).  If it is not given, it will default to the value held
            in  the  IFF  Map  Descriptor.   It  is  available as a command in the
            parameter file, but the qualifier value will take precedence.


  /XMIN=real

          - this qualifier defines the minimum X value of the ground extent around
            the  IFF  file.   It  is  used  so that maps covering the same area of
            ground will be located on top of each other when in DIGIT  form.   The
            value  given  should  ideally  be  less than or equal to the minimum X
            value in  the  IFF  file  excluding  any  origin  offset  in  the  Map
            Descriptor.   If  all  the  extent values surround the IFF range, this
            will  guarantee  that  the  DIGIT  coordinates  will  lie  inside  the
            Reference  Points.   If the qualifier is not given, it will default to
            the appropriate value held in the IFF Control Point (CP) entry.  It is
            available  as a command in the parameter file, but the qualifier value
            will take precedence.


  /XMAX=real

          - this qualifier defines the maximum X value of the ground extent around
            the  IFF  file.   It  is  used  so that maps covering the same area of
            ground will be located on top of each other when in DIGIT  form.   The
            value  given  should ideally be greater than or equal to the maximum X
            value in  the  IFF  file  excluding  any  origin  offset  in  the  Map
            Descriptor.   If  all  the  extent values surround the IFF range, this
            will  guarantee  that  the  DIGIT  coordinates  will  lie  inside  the
            Reference  Points.   If the qualifier is not given, it will default to
            the appropriate value held in the IFF Control Point (CP) entry.  It is
            available  as a command in the parameter file, but the qualifier value
            will take precedence.

  /YMIN=real

          - this qualifier defines the minimum Y value of the ground extent around
            the  IFF  file.   It  is  used  so that maps covering the same area of
            ground will be located on top of each other when in DIGIT  form.   The
            value  given  should  ideally  be  less than or equal to the minimum Y
            value in  the  IFF  file  excluding  any  origin  offset  in  the  Map
            Descriptor.   If  all  the  extent values surround the IFF range, this
            will  guarantee  that  the  DIGIT  coordinates  will  lie  inside  the
            Reference  Points.   If the qualifier is not given, it will default to
            the appropriate value held in the IFF Control Point (CP) entry.  It is
            available  as a command in the parameter file, but the qualifier value
            will take precedence.


  /YMAX=real

          - this qualifier defines the maximum Y value of the ground extent around
            the  IFF  file.   It  is  used  so that maps covering the same area of
            ground will be located on top of each other when in DIGIT  form.   The
            value  given  should ideally be greater than or equal to the maximum Y
            value in  the  IFF  file  excluding  any  origin  offset  in  the  Map

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mRESTRICTIONS[0m

            There are certain types of IFF feature that I2DIGIT does not translate
            fully:

            Arcs, circles and interpolated curves (GTs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) have  the
            points  output  directly from the ST entry.  The parameter file should
            be used to give these features the appropriate  flag.   (ie  cubic  or
            parabolic).

            All text features (GT 10) are ignored.

            Area fill features (GT 12) will not be automatically output  with  the
            relevant  closed  flag  present.  This must be done explicitly via the
            parameter file.

            I2DIGIT will write all the selected features from the  IFF  file  into
            one partition only.

            Note that only a single dataset may be transferred during a single run
            of  the  program but /APPEND can be used to create a tape contain many
            files.

            The /SCALE_IFF and /SCALE_SHEET qualifiers are mutually exclusive with
            /SCALE_FACTOR.

            [1mCommand[0m [1mline[0m

            The symbol I2DIGIT is normally set up as:

                      I2DIGIT == "$LSL$EXE:I2DIGIT"

            and the program may then be used as if it were a normal VMS utility.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mPROGRAM[0m [1mACTION[0m

            For a  full  description  of  the  DIGIT  output  format,  see  FORMAT
            DESCRIPTION section in the documentation of this module.

            Before running  the  program,  it  is  necessary  to  have  created  a
            parameter  file  which must have an entry for each feature (referenced
            by feature code) that is required in the  translation.   Any  features
            not  present  in the parameter file will be ignored during conversion.
            For details of how to create a  parameter  file,  refer  to  the  DATA
            PREPARATION section.

            After decoding the command line for the input file name, output device
            name  and  the qualifiers, the parameter file is read.  If an entry in
            the parameter file is incorrect the whole line is ignored  which  will
            mean that features corresponding to that entry will not be translated.

            I2DIGIT then creates a temporary work file on disk which is given  the
            same name as the input file but with the extension '.I2DIGIT_TMP', for
            example, TEST.I2DIGIT_TMP.  If the program  is  aborted  by  a  method
            outside  its  control  (eg  by the user typing Ctrl-Y), then this file
            will left in the current working directory.  This is a binary file and
            should  not  be displayed or printed but deleted as it is intended for
            internal use by the program.

            The program must generate this temporary file because the DIGIT format
            requires  the  file size (in DIGIT sectors) to be written in the first
            sector.  Clearly, this will not be known until the  IFF  file  has  be
            processed  and so to prevent the need to perform two passes of the IFF
            file, the data is first written to disk and then copied to the tape.

            The tape is then initialised and this will only  be  successful  if  a
            valid  tape device is given and the tape device has been mounted using
            MOUNT/FOREIGN.  There is no need to specify a record or  blocksize  as
            the program will write tape files with a blocksize of 12288 bytes.

            The are three criteria that must be fulfilled in order to  process  an
            IFF feature:

                  o  The feature must have a valid entry in the parameter file.

                  o  If the /FC qualifier is given, then  its  feature  code  must
                     fall  within  this  list.   If  not,  then  all  features are
                     converted subject to the other conditions.

                  o  If the /LAYER qualifier is given, then the feature must  fall

                                             NOTE

                    Until experienced is gained in using  I2DIGIT,  it  is
                    quite  likely  that  the  program  will generate DIGIT
                    pixels outside the valid range for 2-byte integers  (1
                    to  32767)  and hence abort.  This will be because one
                    or more of the values given in the  above  calculation
                    is  wrong causing an incorrect shift or scaling of the
                    coordinates.  If this happens, the maximum and minimum
                    values  should be substituted into the formula by hand
                    to determine which value is wrong.


            It is assumed to be the responsibility of the user to use  appropriate
            values  to  be  substituted  into the above formulas so that the DIGIT
            pixels will fall inside the area defined by the Reference  Points  and
            inside  the  range  1  to  32767.  Each DIGIT pixel coordinate will be
            tested if it lies within the range 1 to 32767 and if it  does  not,  a
            warning  is  given to flag the offending feature.  However, it is very
            likely that by simply correcting the values to be substituted  in  the
            formula  this problem will be solved.  This should be done rather than
            trying to edit the  offending  feature,  since  many  or  all  of  the
            features could be outside the range.

  NOSUCHFILE, file 'name' does not exist

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The file specified on the command line does not exist.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Ensure that the file-spec given on the command line is  for  a
      file that exists.

  NOTMNTFOR, magtape device "'device'" must be mounted foreign

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The specified tape  device  specified  has  not  been  mounted
      foreign.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Mount the  tape  with  the  MOUNT/FOREIGN  command  and  rerun
      I2DIGIT.

  OUTOFRANGE, coordinates out of range in FSN 'number'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The coordinates of the specified feature are out of the  valid
      range of 1 to 32767 for DIGIT pixels.  This is most likely to be because one
      or more of the values used in the formula which calculates the  DIGIT  pixel
      are incorrect.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Do not edit the feature until  you  have  checked  the  scale,
      extent,  border  and  offset  values.   Refer  to  the documentation for the
      formula and substitute (by hand) the maximum and minimum IFF values into  it
      to  determine which value is incorrect.  It may require some practice to get
      appropriate values for the arguments to the formula as it is intended to  be
      as flexible as possible.

  TWONUMS, Two integers for X and Y required

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The offset requires two integers for the X and Y value  to  be
      given to /OFFSET qualifier or to the OFFSET command in the parameter file.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Given two values for the OFFSET and run the program again.

  UNSETMD, Map Descriptor required for scale

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The MD entry is required to set so that the SHEET scale can be
      taken  from  it.   This  is required if SCALE_FACTOR and SCALE_SHEET are not
      used.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Correct the MD  entry  using  ITRANS/DESCRIPTOR  and  run  the
      program again.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
