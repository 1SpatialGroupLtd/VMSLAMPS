            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            RESTRICTIONS        - a summary of restrictions on the use of

            EXAMPLES            - annotated examples of utility useage.

            MESSAGES            - all classes of message are listed and described
                                  and suggested user action given. The messages
                                  are divided into sections according to message
                                  severity within which the messages are ordered
                                  alphabetically by message mnemonic.

            The DCW is a general-purpose  database  containing  digital  map  data
            covering the world and divided into thematic layers.

            The DCW uses a georelational model called Vector Product Format  (VPF)
            to  support a vector-based, thematically layered database.  The VPF is
            described in the document MIL-STD-600006.

            The DCW is available on  four  separate  CD-ROMs,  each  containing  a
            region  of  the  world  at  1:1,000,000  scale called a library.  Each
            CD-ROM also contains a BROWSE library which  is  an  overview  of  the
            globe at 1:31,000,000 scale.

            As the DCW database tables are binary in format, the  data  cannot  be
            shown except as schematic tables denoting the rows and columns.

            Any errors or faults present in the DCW data cannot be  corrected  due
            to  fact  that the data is read-only from CD-ROMs and the donor of the
            data should be  contacted.   However,  it  is  possible  to  copy  the
            required  DCW  files  onto  a  writable  media providing the directory
            hierarchy and contents remains the  same  and  edit  the  files  using
            PATCH/ABSOLUTE.   This  is  only  recommended  for  users  who  have a
            thorough knowledge of DCW database tables.  PATCH/ABSOLUTE can only be
            used  to  overwrite  data, not insert it which means editing the files
            will be of limited use.

            All recipients of the DCW data should receive an  accompanying  manual
            called  the  DCW  Product  Specification  (document MIL-D-89009) which
            describes, in detail, the format of all database tables.

            This section will therefore only provide an overview of the  structure
            of the database and how the tables relate to each other.

            The highest level of hierarchy which exist within DCW is the database,
            below which exist the 5 libraries:

            Each  library  exists  on  its  own  CD-ROM  except  BROWSE  which  is
            duplicated on each of the others.

            Within each library,  there  are  a  number  of  coverages  which  are
            analogous  to  IFF  layers.  There are 8 thematic layers in the BROWSE
            library and 17 in the others, each having a  unique  mnemonic.   These
            are as follows:

            At the coverage level, features are grouped  into  classes  of  areas,
            lines,  points  and text.  Each class is held as a Feature Table which
            contains all the features for the coverage over the  whole  extent  of
            the library and can typically be very large.

            The  Feature  Tables  will  be  of  the  form  ccAREA.AFT  for  areas,
            ccLINE.LFT  for lines, ccPOINTS.PFT for points and ccTEXT.TFT for text
            where 'cc' is the coverage mnemonic.  (eg DNLINE.LFT for the  Drainage
            Line Feature Table).

            Each coverage contains  a  Feature  Class  Schema  (FCS)  table  which
            contains the primary and foreign key relationships between the various
            DCW tables.

            The coverages overlay a tiling system which divides the globe up  into
            a  grid  of  tiles  called  GEOREFs  which  are  themselves split into
            sub-tiles (henceforth simply  called  tiles).   Refer  to  the  GEOREF
            Tiling System below.

            Each tile has a Primitive Table corresponding to a feature class which
            is  cross-referenced  with  their  respective Feature Tables using the
            foreign keys defined in  the  FCS  table.   The  Feature  Tables  hold
            information at the feature level such as feature-coding and attributes
            while the  Primitive  Tables  hold  the  geometry.   If  a  particular
            Primitive Table is missing from a tile, then no features of that class
            are present in that area.

            The Area Feature Table references the face (FAC), ring (RNG) and  edge
            (EDG) Primitive Tables.

            The Line Feature Table references the edge (EDG) Primitive Table.

            The GEOREF system is a naming convention for each 15 degree square  in
            a  grid  covering the world.  Each 15 degree tile is identified by two
            letters; the first represents the latitude and the  second  represents
            the  longitude.   The  valid longitude letters are A to Z (excluding I
            and O) and valid latitude letters are A to M (excluding I).   Examples
            of invalid GEOREFs are II, AN and OC.

            Each GEOREF on a DCW CD-ROM is  divided  into  nine  5  degree  square
            sub-tiles  referenced in a 3 by 3 grid from 1,1 to 3,3 where the first
            number is in the x direction and the second is in the y direction.

            The south-west corner of GEOREF AA11  is  at  (-180.0,-90.0)  and  for
            GEOREF ZM33 it is at (175.0,85.0) with NG11 at (0.0,0.0).

            A figure of the GEOREF tiling system is presented in the  DCW  Product
            Specification  which  should  be  used  as a reference when extracting
            files.

            It should be noted  that  the  GEOREF  Tiling  System  underlies  each
            library  except the BROWSE library which has Primitive Tables covering
            the whole globe.

            Not all of the database tables present on the CD-ROMs  are  needed  by
            the  conversion  software  as  some are intended for GIS applications,
            such as Thematic Index, Spatial Index and Bounding  Rectangle  tables.
            Variable-length index files are required to find the starting position
            of variable length text or coordinate records within certain tables.

            IFF is a feature orientated data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            The DCW format shares this concept of  a  'feature'  but  the  various
            information  relevant  to a single feature is held in several database
            tables which reference each other using primary keys.   Refer  to  the
            FORMAT  DESCRIPTION  section  for  details of the structure of the DCW
            data.

            Features in DCW are identified not by a feature code or feature serial
            number, but by one or more attributes.  The mechanism used by DCW2I to
            determine the feature code to be assigned to IFF features from DCW  is
            via the Feature Code Table.  This associates one or two DCW attributes
            with a numeric IFF feature code and  must  be  defined  prior  to  the
            conversion.

            The Feature Code Table file is compulsory and relates one or  two  DCW
            attributes in each feature table to an IFF feature code.

            In order to correctly define the Feature Code Tables,  the  user  must
            have  access  the  DCW  Product  Specification  which  lists  all  the
            attributes present in the DCW feature tables.

            It is important to realise that the feature  code  is  only  given  to
            feature  whose  attribute  names and values exactly match those in the
            Feature Code Table so it is vital that the FCT is accurate.   The  FCT
            is used to select only those features required and so if the DCW table
            name or any of the primary/secondary attribute  name/values  given  in
            the FCT does not exactly match a particular feature, it will be thrown
            away with no warnings to the user.

            The lines of the table  are  free-format,  so  the  order  of  entries
            matters,  but  the  actual  position  of  entries  on  the line is not
            important.  Any line with the "!" character is regarded as a  comment,
            and  is  ignored.   Comments can appear at the end of lines containing
            fields, or on separate lines.  Note that all text fields in  the  file
            will  be  upper cased in order to match the attribute names in the DCW
            tables.

                          match those in a DCW  database  table.   This  value  is
                          compulsory and should be in the range 1 to 32767.
               [1mDCWtable [0m- the  name  of  the  DCW  database  Feature  Table  whose
                          features  will  be  assigned  the  feature  code of this
                          entry.  If no Primary or Secondary attributes are  given
                          on  the line, then all features in the Feature Table are
                          given the feature code.  The  name  should  contain  the
                          appropriate  extension  for  the  class  of  table  (ie.
                          '.AFT', '.LFT', '.PFT' or '.TFT' for area,  line,  point
                          and text feature tables respectively).
               [1mP-Att    [0m- the  name  of  the  Primary  Attribute  present  in  the
                          [1mDCWtable[0m  which  contains  a  fixed attribute to be used
                          when  determining  the  feature  code.   This  field  is
                          optional  since  some  tables  do  not contain any fixed
                          attributes, but  if  it  is  given,  there  must  be  an
                          accompanying  Primary Attribute value.  The feature code
                          is assign to a feature which comes from the [1mDCWtable[0m and
                          which  has  a  Primary  Attribute  defined as [1mP-Att[0m with
                          value [1mP-Val[0m.
               [1mP-Val    [0m- the fixed value of the Primary Attribute, [1mP-Att[0m, present
                          in  the [1mDCWtable[0m to be used when determining the feature
                          code.  This field is optional but must be present if the
                          Primary  Attribute  name  is present.  Primary Attribute
                          values are always of type integer.
               [1mS-Att    [0m- the name of  the  Secondary  Attribute  present  in  the
                          [1mDCWtable[0m  which  contains  a  fixed attribute to be used
                          when determining the feature code.   If  this  field  is
                          present,   there   must  be  an  accompanying  Secondary
                          Attribute value.   The  feature  code  is  assign  to  a
                          feature  which  comes  from  the  [1mDCWtable[0m,  which has a
                          Primary Attribute defined as [1mP-Att[0m with value [1mP-Val[0m, and
                          has  a  Secondary  Attribute called [1mS-Att[0m whose value is
                          that of [1mS-Val[0m.
               [1mS-Val    [0m- the fixed  value  of  the  Secondary  Attribute,  [1mS-Att[0m,
                          present  in the [1mDCWtable[0m to be used when determining the
                          feature code.   This  field  is  optional  but  must  be
                          present  if  the  Secondary  Attribute  name is present.
                          Secondary Attribute values are always of type integer.

            The Attribute Code Table file is optional and can be used to assign to
            certain features any integer, date, or text attributes held in the DCW
            database.

            In order to correctly define the Attribute Code Table, the  user  must
            have  access  the  DCW  Product  Specification  which  lists  all  the
            attributes present in the DCW feature tables.

            It is important to realise that an attribute will only be given  to  a
            feature  with  the  correct feature code and if the attribute name and
            datatype match those in the Attribute Code Table, so it is vital  that
            the ACT is accurate.

            The lines of the table  are  free-format,  so  the  order  of  entries
            matters,  but  the  actual  position  of  entries  on  the line is not
            important.  Any line with the "!" character is regarded as a  comment,
            and  is  ignored.   Comments can appear at the end of lines containing
            fields, or on separate lines.  Note that all text fields in  the  file
            will  be  upper cased in order to match the attribute names in the DCW
            tables.
            A line of the Attribute Code Table has the following form :-

               [1mAC   FC   Att-Name   Att-Type[0m

            where the fields are :-

               [1mAC       [0m- the attribute code (as defined in the  ACD  part  of  an
                          FRT)  to  be  given  to the IFF feature with the feature
                          code [1mFC[0m.  This value is compulsory and should be in  the
                          range 1 to 32767.
               [1mFC       [0m- the feature code of  the  feature  to  be  assigned  the
                          attribute.  This value is compulsory and should not only
                          be in the range 1 to 32767, but also match  the  feature
                          code  of  the  corresponding  entry  in the Feature Code
                          Table.
               [1mAtt-Name [0m- the name of the attribute present in the [1mDCWtable[0m of the
                          FCT defined by [1mFC[0m.
               [1mAtt-Type [0m- the datatype of the attribute defined  by  [1mAtt-Name[0m  and
                          must be of type 'T' (text), 'I' (integer) or 'D' (date).
                          Defining a value of type  'I'  in  the  ACT  allows  DCW
                          attributes  of  type  'S'  (short  integer) or 'I' (long
                          integer) to be converted.  If the  [1mAtt-Name[0m  matches  an
                          attribute  in  a DCW table, but the [1mAtt-Type[0m is wrong, a
                          warning will be produced and the true datatype from  the
                          DCW table will be used.

            Certain attributes are defined in the  DCW  Product  Specification  as
            having  fixed  values  and  these  can be used to sub-divide a feature
            class into several feature codes.  The INT.VDT files listed in the DCW
            Product  Specification  lists  the  fixed attribute values for integer
            attributes of the classes in that coverage.

            The attributes to use should be of the form 'ccxxnnnn' where  'cc'  is
            the  coverage  mnemonic  (eg.  CL), 'xx' is the class (eg.  PY, LN, PT
            for polygons, lines and point resp.) and 'nnnn' is  the  remainder  of
            the  name of any length.  For example, HYLNTYPE is an attribute in the
            Hypsography line feature table.

            The attributes which should be put in the FCT and ACT depends  on  how
            general  a  feature-coding scheme is required.  If the Appendix of the
            DCW Product  Specification  lists  all  the  possible  values  for  an
            attribute  then  in may be used in the FCT to divide a class into more
            than one feature code.

            For  example,  the  contours  in  the  Hypsography  coverage  have  an
            attribute  HYLNTYPE which can have possible values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
            or 9 to distinguish between contour types.  This  attribute  could  be
            entered  in the Feature Code Table with a feature code for each of the
            possible values thus:

            ! FC  DCWtable   P-Att   P-Val  S-Att   S-Val
            1050 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   1
            1051 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   2
            1052 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   3
            1053 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   4
            1054 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   5
            1055 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   8
            1056 HYLINE.LFT HYLNTYPE   9

            This will ensure that each value of the HYLNTYPE  attribute  found  in
            the  table  HYLINE.LFT  will  result  in the IFF feature being given a
            different feature code to the others.  As  there  is  only  one  fixed
            attribute in the HYLINE.LFT, no secondary attribute is possible.

            If a more general feature-coding scheme is required for the  contours,
            just the feature code value and the table name could be entered thus:

            ! FC  DCWtable   P-Att   P-Val  S-Att   S-Val
            1050 HYLINE.LFT

            As there are no attributes defined here, no attributes  in  the  table
            HYLINE.LFT  will be used to determine the feature code and all contour
            lines will be assigned the feature code of 1050.


            The attribute HYLNVAL contains the actual contour height which is  not
            a  fixed  attribute.   It  could therefore be entered in the Attribute
            Code File with the AC number it is to be given and the feature code of
            the feature.  The feature code should match those in the FCT.  For the

            first of the FCT examples above, the  corresponding  ACT  lines  might
            look thus:

            ! AC  FC   Att     Type
            2010 1050 HYLNVAL    I
            2010 1051 HYLNVAL    I
            2010 1052 HYLNVAL    I
            2010 1053 HYLNVAL    I
            2010 1054 HYLNVAL    I
            2010 1055 HYLNVAL    I
            2010 1056 HYLNVAL    I

            Note that the same AC code (2010) will be given to each of the feature
            codes 1050 to 1056.

            The second FCT example could have  a  corresponding  ACT  entry  which
            looks like:

            ! AC  FC   Att     Type
            2010 1050 HYLNVAL    I

            Since there is only  one  feature  code  defined  in  the  second  FCT
            example,  the  ACT only needs one AC defined to be attached to feature
            code 1050.


            For an example of the use of primary and secondary  attributes,  refer
            to  the  description  of  the  Drainage line table, DNLINE.LFT, in the
            appendix of the DCW Product Specification.

            Attribute DNLNTYPE can have values 1 to 9 to classify the type of  the
            drainage  feature.   There  could therefore be 9 entries in the FCT if
            that degree of distinction is required between the types  of  drainage
            feature.   Since  this  attribute  distinguishes  between such diverse
            drainage features as rivers,  canals,  shorelines  and  glaciers,  the
            breaking  down  of  these  into  different  feature  codes  is  almost
            essential.

            A second fixed attribute, DNLNSTAT, has values which are only possible
            when  combined  with  values  of the DNLNTYPE attribute.  For example,
            DNLNSTAT values 1 (perennial),  2  (nonperennial)  and  6  (unsurveyed
            perennial) only apply to DNLNTYPE 1 (streams).

            Following the description of the DNLINE.LFT table  is  a  table  which
            defines the legal combinations for drainage line attributes.  This can
            be used directly when creating the FCT for the Drainage line  features
            which may look thus:

            ! FC  DCWtable    P-Att   P-Val  S-Att   S-Val

            [1mNull[0m [1mCoded[0m [1mAttributes[0m

            There are some attributes  which  are  defined  as  NULL  in  the  DCW
            database which means that the attribute does not apply to a feature or
            that a feature is incorrectly coded.

            A list of null coded attributes is present in the VPFVIEW User  Manual
            which should accompany the DCW CD-ROMs.

            A null coded attribute  will  have  the  value  -2147483637  (80000001
            hexadecimal)  and  can  be  entered  in  the  FCT  as  any other fixed
            attribute value thus:

            ! FC  DCWtable    P-Att    P-Val
            1018 LCAREA.AFT  LCPYTYPE  -2147483647    ! HOLES IN LAND COVER
            1019 LCAREA.AFT  LCPYTYPE   1             ! RICE FIELDS
            1020 LCAREA.AFT  LCPYTYPE   2             ! CRANBERRY BOGS
            [etc]

            For those cases where null codes occur there should not be a secondary
            attribute  present.   Some occurrances of the null coded values may be
            ignored, such as for attributes DQPYAHA and DQPYAVA since they are not
            used  to  determine the feature code and need not be in the FCT.  They
            may however be present in the ACT file in which case the program  will
            omit the attribute from the IFF file if the value is a null code.

                                             NOTE

                    Often, area features do not close  because  they  have
                    been  incorrectly coded in the DCW data as having NULL
                    codes.  For example, some line  features  (rivers)  in
                    the DN (drainage) coverage are NULL coded as areas and
                    never close and so trying to  build  an  area  out  of
                    these   will   cause  the  TOOMANYEDGES  message.   We
                    therefore recommend that the NULL coded  features  ARE
                    NOT  PRESENT  IN  THE  FEATURE CODE TABLE so that they
                    will be ignored.

  [1mFUNCTION[0m

            DCW2I extracts data from a Digital Chart of  World  (DCW)  CD-ROM  and
            creates  individual  IFF  files for each 5 degree square tile for each
            coverage.  The program must use a parameter file  to  determine  which
            IFF feature codes to assign to features and this also controls feature
            selection.  Any features not present in the Feature Code file will  be
            omitted.   A  similar parameter file is required for the conversion of
            DCW attributes into IFF AC entries.

  [1mPROMPTS[0m

            DCW2I is an interactive, command driven  utility.   Command  input  is
            expected when the following prompt is given:

                 DCW2I >

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m

            None.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mRESTRICTIONS[0m

            Text features will not be output along shaped  lines.   In  DCW  data,
            text  features  may  be  accompanied  with  a  SHAPE_LINE  field which
            controls the position and orientation along a line.  DCW2I will output
            the  first  point  of  the  SHAPE_LINE as the lower left corner of the
            string.  If the SHAPE_LINE contains one point,  the  feature  will  be
            given  a  rotation (RO) of zero, otherwise it will be given a rotation
            equal to the angle between the first and last points.

            Coverages GAZETTE, LIBREF and TILEREF are not catered for.

            The program does not guarantee that the area features created from the
            DCW  database are 'correct' when traversed (ie the inside is always on
            the same side of the edge).  Typically, areas  containing  holes  will
            have line segments which cross and these may cause problems if the IFF
            files are used with other LAMPS programs such as IPOLYGON.

            The output IFF files have the following characteristics:

            The format of the filename is CCGGnn.IFF where CC is the coverage,  GG
            is the GEOREF and nn is the sub-tile (eg DQXE32).

            For each coverage, a sub-directory (with the coverage name) is created
            into  which all files relating to that coverage will go.  For example,
            if a target directory of LSL$DATA_ROOT:[DCWDATA]  is  given,  all  IFF
            files  created  from the Data Quality (DQ) coverage will be put into a
            directory called LSL$DATA_ROOT:[DCWDATA.DQ].

            The IFF range entry (RA) will lie between 0.0 and 5.0 in x and  y  and
            the  origin offset in the Map Descriptor (MD) entry will be set to the
            south-west corner of the tile from which it originated.  For  example,
            a tile at GEOREF XE32 will have origin offset (145.0,-25.0).  Refer to
            the GEOREF Tiling System diagram  in  the  back  of  the  DCW  Product
            Specification  for  information  on the longitude and latitude of each
            GEOREF.

            A description of the Feature and Attribute Code files can be found  in
            the DATA PREPARATION section of the IFFDCW Reference Manual.

            The Feature Code file  is  compulsory  and  relates  one  or  two  DCW
            attributes in each feature table to an IFF feature code.

            The Attribute Code is optional and is used to define the output IFF AC
            codes and their datatypes for any DCW attributes.  If it is not given,
            no attributes will be present in the output IFF files.


            [1mProgram[0m [1mAction[0m

            Before the program is  invoked,  the  desired  DCW  CD-ROM  should  be
            mounted  using CD_MOUNT.  Alternatively, it is possible to emulate the
            CD-ROM by copying the required files onto another device providing the
            directory  hierarchy and content remains the same.  It is not possible
            to copy the DCW directory files (.DIR) onto to a VAX/VMS device  since
            they originated from MS-DOS and are not compatible.  They will have to
            be created with the same names and hierarchy using CREATE/DIRECTORY.

            When the program is invoked, the user is presented with  a  prompt  at
            which  all  commands  must  be  entered.   The  GO  command begins the
            translation but before it is specified the Feature Code file, library,
            device, target directory and at least one feature class must be given.

            The program begins by reading the Feature  Class  Schema  (FCS)  table
            which  is  essential  for all coverages as it contains the primary and
            foreign key relationships between the various  DCW  tables.   If  this
            file cannot be read then no data in the coverage can be translated.


  IFFDCW REFERENCE (1.2): DCW2I utility                                   Page 3-4
  UTILITY DCW2I                                                        14 May 1993


            Now, the Feature Tables for each coverage will be read and since these
            files  cover  the  whole  library they are usually quite large and may
            take a long time.  These files are read into memory and structured  in
            a  way  that  will  allow  fast access to any row of the table.  This,
            however, has a large memory overhead and  may  exceed  the  page  file
            quota allocated to the user process.  If this happens, see if the page
            file quota can be increased or run the program one class at a time.

            It is recommended that only those classes required in the  translation
            are  selected  as  this will prevent the need to hold potentially very
            large tables in memory which are never used.  This will also  help  in
            reducing the processing time.

            Each IFF file will now be opened and the  Primitive  Tables  for  each
            class  will be read.  These are cross-referenced with their respective
            Feature Tables using the foreign keys defined in the FCS  table.   The
            Feature   Tables  hold  information  at  the  feature  level  such  as
            attributes and the Primitive Tables hold the geometry.

            The Area Feature Table references the face (FAC), ring (RNG) and  edge
            (EDG) Primitive Tables.

            The Line Feature Table references the edge (EDG) Primitive Table.

            The Point Feature Table references the node (END) Primitive Table.

            The Text Feature Table references the text (TXT) Primitive Table.

            When the IFF file is closed, the memory used for the Primitive  Tables
            can  be  freed  but this is not the case for the Feature Tables.  Only
            when all the tiles in a particular coverage have been  translated  can
            the  memory assigned to the Feature Tables be freed and made available
            for the next set of coverage tables.

            [1mRecommendations[0m

            When processing large volumes  of  data,  the  following  factors  are
            advised.

             o  Run the program as a batch job.
                This will ensure a log file is produced which will provide a  list
                of all files created and any problems that occurred.

             o  Translate one coverage at a time.
                The more coverages that are converted in one go, the  greater  the
                amount  of  memory  used.   Even  though  the  memory allocated to
                Feature Tables is freed between  coverages,  there  is  inevitably
                some  'latent' memory build up which may tip the balance and cause
                the program to exceed its page file quota.

             o  Only select those feature classes required.
                This will prevent the program from holding large unused tables  in
                memory and help speed up the translation.

             o  Use the ENABLE VERBOSE option.  This is the default.
                The output of additional messages during the translation can  help
                in identifying the source of any problems that occur.

            [1mDCW[0m [1mArea[0m [1mFeatures[0m

            DCW holds area features in face  (FAC),  ring  (RNG)  and  edge  (EDG)
            tables.  The face table contains a face ID number and a pointer to the
            ring table.  The ring table contains a list of  all  the  edges  which
            make  up a face, the first edge being the perimeter and any subsequent
            edges are holes within the polygon.  This list in the  ring  table  is
            series of pointers into the edge table which denotes the start edge of
            the perimeter or hole.  By following edges through the edge table, the
            pointers should cycle back to the start edge.

            Area features are created in DCW2I by building  up  a  list  of  edges
            making up the perimeter and joining the holes in the area by invisible
            line segments.  The starting edge of the perimeter (or hole) may point
            to  other  edges  and  the  list  cycles back around to the start edge
            again, thus closing the perimeter (or hole).  Any holes in the polygon
            will  be  connected to the last point of the perimeter by an invisible
            line (pen-up) segment.

            It has been discovered (in coverage PO for  example)  that  there  are
            some edges in the EDG table which have the same face on both sides and
            are often used to connect islands to a  coast  by  this  single  line.
            However,  there  are examples where these edges are used in such a way
            that causes the IFF area features to close but be 'inside-out' and not
            filled correctly.

            These edges (with the same face on both side) can also cause the  edge
            list  not  to  close  which  would  result  in the program creating an
            infinite list of edges which make up an area.  The  program  therefore
            checks if the number of entries in the list has exceeded a limit which
            will only result in a warning message (TOOMANYEDGES) and  the  feature
            being ignored.

                                             NOTE

                    Often, these area features do not close  because  they
                    have  been incorrectly coded in the DCW data as having
                    NULL codes.  For example, some line features  (rivers)
                    in  the  DN (drainage) coverage are NULL coded as area
                    and never close and so trying to build an area out  of
                    these   will   cause  the  TOOMANYEDGES  message.   We
                    therefore recommend that the NULL coded  features  ARE
                    NOT  PRESENT  IN  THE  FEATURE CODE TABLE so that they
                    will be ignored.


            It is therefore  recommended  that  inspection  of  area  features  is
            performed using LITES2 to identify and try to correct any problems.

                      The Attribute Code file must be read by the program if it is
                      to handle attributes in the translation.  This file models a
                      lookup mechanism between DCW attributes and IFF AC codes and
                      can  also  be  used  to  select  which  attributes  will  be

                      ignored.

                      The lookup mechanism enables any field (not just attributes)
                      of  a  DCW  table  to be output as an IFF AC attached to the
                      feature, provided it is of type integer (I),  short  integer
                      (S  in  DCW,  but  I in the AC file ), date (D) or text (T).
                      This is especially useful for debugging as it would  enable,
                      for  example,  the ID from a DCW table to be output as an AC

                              is  required.  If no coverages are selected when the
                              GO command is specified, a warning is given and  all
                              coverages are selected.

                              Valid BROWSE coverages are CO, DV, DN, GR,  DA,  IN,
                              PO and PP.

                      [1mDESELECT GEOREF[0m  GEOREF-list

                              This is used to remove one or more GEOREFs or single
                              GEOREF  sub-tiles  from the current list of selected
                              ones.  If the GEOREF-list  contains  just  a  single
                              GEOREF  such  as XE, then all 9 sub-tiles (11 to 33)
                              will automatically be removed.  It is also  possible
                              to  remove individual sub-tiles by specifying XE:32,
                              for example, which removes  tile  32  in  GEOREF  XE
                              providing XE has already been selected.

                      [1mDESELECT LIBRARY[0m  BROWSE|EURNASIA|NOAMER|SASAUS|SOAMAFR

                              This command can be used to deselect  the  currently
                              selected library.  Since the coverages in the BROWSE
                              library  are  different  to  those  in   the   other
                              libraries,  all  coverages  will  be deselected when
                              swapping  between  then.   However,  when   changing
                              between  libraries  with the same coverages, no such
                              deselection is made.  Selecting a new  library  with
                              the  SELECT  LIBRARY  command  has  exactly the same
                              effect.

              [1mDEVICE[0m 'device-name'

                      This compulsory command tells the program the device name of
                      the  CD-ROM  reader  from  with the data is to be extracted.
                      The device should contain a DCW CD-ROM mounted in accordance
                      with ISO 9660 provided by the CD_MOUNT utility.  The program
                      checks that there is a top-level directory called  'DCW'  on
                      the mounted media.

                      It is possible to copy files from the  CD-ROM  onto  another
                      device  and  use  that provided that the directory structure
                      and content are identical.   An  example  of  the  structure
                      would be 'device-name:[DCW.SASAUS.DQ.X.E.33]'.

              [1mDISABLE[0m  'sub-command'

                      This command is the inverse of the ENABLE command.   It  has
                      identical sub-commands and turns off the enabled options.

                      [1mDISABLE REPLY[0m

                              This command is used to  prevent  the  program  from
                              confirming each command given with a reply.

                      [1mDISABLE VERBOSE[0m

                              This command  is  used  to  inform  the  program  to
                              produce only the minimal number of messages required
                              during processing.  If a problem occurs  during  the
                              translation, it may not be immediately obvious where
                              it occurred without the additional messages  and  so
                              the  verbose  option  is enabled by default.  If, as
                              will often be the case, the  program  is  run  as  a

              [1mENABLE[0m  'sub-command'

                      This command is used to turn on certain options.

                      [1mENABLE REPLY[0m

                              This  command  is  used  to  tell  the  program   to
                              confirming each command given with a reply.  This is
                              the default action.

                      [1mENABLE VERBOSE[0m

                              This command is used to inform the program to output
                              more  messages during processing.  If the program is
                              run as a batch process,  the  batch  log  file  will
                              contain  a  useful record of any problems and having
                              the verbose option enabled will help.  This  is  the
                              default action.

              [1mFCFILE[0m 'file-spec'

                      The Feature Code file is compulsory and is used to determine
                      which  feature  codes to assign to each IFF feature based on
                      one or two  DCW  attributes.   This  file  models  a  lookup
                      mechanism  between  DCW attributes and IFF feature codes but
                      can  also  be  used  to  select  which  features   will   be
                      translated,  so  that  any  not  present in the file will be
                      ignored.

              [1mGO[0m

                      This command should be the last one  given  and  starts  the
                      processing of the data based on the selections made.  Before
                      the GO command is given it is necessary  to  have  specified
                      the Feature Code file, library, device, target directory and
                      at least one feature class.

              [1mQUIT[0m

                      This command is used to exit the program  before  processing
                      is  started  with  the  GO  command.   After  processing  is
                      finished, the program is  automatically  terminated  and  so
                      QUIT is not needed then.  Ctrl-Z will also abort the program
                      from the interactive prompt.

              [1mRETURN[0m

                      This command is required at the end of an  indirect  command
                      file  and is used to tell the program to return from reading
                      the file back to interactive input.  If  it  is  not  given,
                      control will return when the end of the file is reached.

              [1mSELECT[0m  'sub-command'

                      This command is used to determine which aspects of  the  DCW
                      data set are required to be translated into IFF.

                      [1mSELECT CLASS[0m  ALL|AREAS|LINES|POINTS|TEXT

                              This is used to add all or one feature class type to
                              the  list  of  selected  classes.   The arguments to
                              SELECT   and   DESELECT   CLASS    are    themselves
                              sub-commands  and  only  one is permitted at a time.
                              If more are required,  type  in  the  whole  command
                              again.    Initially  all  feature  classes  will  be
                              selected and at least one  class  must  be  selected
                              before  attempting  to  use  the  GO  command.   The
                              ability to select just a few  classes  prevents  the
                              program  from reading those (potentially very large)
                              unwanted DCW tables and hence decreases the time and
                              memory requirements on the program.

                              This is used to add one or  more  coverages  to  the
                              current  list  of  selected  ones.  No coverages are
                              initially selected as these depend on which  library
                              is  required.  If no coverages are selected when the
                              GO command is specified, a warning is given and  all
                              coverages are selected.

                              Valid BROWSE coverages are CO, DV, DN, GR,  DA,  IN,
                              PO and PP.

                              all   coverages  in  the  current  library  will  be
                              selected.

                      [1mSELECT GEOREF[0m  GEOREF-list

                              This is used to add one or more  GEOREFs  or  single
                              GEOREF  sub-tiles  to  the  current list of selected
                              ones.  If the GEOREF-list  contains  just  a  single

                              will be extracted.  It is also possible  to  extract
                              individual   sub-tiles   by  specifying  XE:32,  for

                              specified,  a  warning  is  given  and  all  will be
                              selected.

                              It is likely that all GEOREFs will be  extracted  at
                              once but 10 individual ones are permitted.  For each
                              one in this list, a record is kept of which of the 9
                              sub-tiles  are required.  If the limit of 10 GEOREFs
                              is not sufficient, then the program should be run as
                              many times as required.

                              required.  Since the coverages in the BROWSE library
                              are different to those in the other  libraries,  all
                              coverages  will  be deselected when swapping between

                      given,  all  IFF  files  created  from the Data Quality (DQ)
                      coverage   will   be   put   into   a    directory    called
                      LSL$DATA_ROOT:[DCWDATA.DQ].

              [1mTEXTGAP[0m  'tolerance'

                      This command defines the spacing between  characters  which,
                      if  exceeded,  will  result in an extra space being inserted
                      between each character of a text string.

                      Each DCW text Feature Table contains a TEXTGAP  field  which
                      contains  a  value  defining the spacing between characters.
                      In order to give the  user  control  over  this,  additional
                      spaces can be inserted by entering a tolerance which is less
                      than those in the table.  However,  DCW  text  data  already
                      contains  extra spaces between characters and so the default
                      tolerance is large (100.0) so that the user must  explicitly
                      set it to force the insertion of extra spaces.

  [1mMESSAGES[0m [1m(INFORMATIONAL)[0m

  These messages give information only, and require no  immediate  action  by  the
  user.  They are used to provide information on the current state of the program,
  or to supply explanatory information in support of a warning or error message.

  ALLSEL, No 'missing-selection' have been selected.  All will be extracted

      [1mExplanation:[0m  This message applies to both coverages and GEOREFs and informs
      the  user  that  one  set  was  not explicitly selected and so ALL have been
      selected for you.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Check that you really did intend this and  you  did  not  just
      forget  to  select  the appropriate coverages or GEOREFs.  Abort the program
      and run again as necessary.

  CMDINPUT, Command input being read from file 'file-spec'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  This message is to confirm that input is being  read  from  an
      indirect file and reports the name of the file.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  None.

  COORDS, Potential problem at or near coordinate 'x','y'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The coordinates reported refer  to  the  approximate  absolute
      position   of   a  problem  that  occurred  due  to  'dangling  edges'  when
      constructing an area feature.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  The coordinates are intended to aid the user when checking for
      problems  in  the  data  using  LITES2.   The  FSN  reported  by the message
      TWODANGLES should also help check that the area feature is complete.

  MISSINGTABLE, Missing 'name' table for 'class' features in tile 'tilename'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  In  order  to  extract  the  features  in  the  tile  for  the
      particular class, certain primitive tables must be present in the data.  For
      area features, these are the FAC,RNG and EDG tables; for line features,  the
      EDG  table; for point features, the END table and for text features, the TXT
      table are needed.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  If a particular feature table exists for a  coverage  but  the
      required  primitive table does exist in the tile, then that feature class is
      not present in that 5 degree tile.  If the  feature  table  exists  for  the
      coverage,  then  there  must  be  some  tile within the library that has the
      required primitive table, but the reported tile did not, in which  case  the
      message should be ignored.

  NODIR, 'directory' - no IFF file 'filename'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The directory given does not  exist  in  the  library  of  the
      current  CD-ROM  being  read.   No  IFF file with the corresponding name can
      therefore be created.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  None.  This indicates that the CD-ROM simply does not  contain
      data for that coverage and tile.

  RETURN, RETURN command detected - returning to terminal input

      [1mExplanation:[0m  This message  is  to  confirm  that  the  RETURN  command  was
      detected and input has been returned to the terminal.

  SKIPCOV, Skipping coverage 'name' due to above problem

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Due to some problem while reading  the  specified,  processing
      can  not  continue  and so it has been skipped in order to proceed on to any
      remaining selected coverages.

      should contact Laser-Scan.

  SKIPGEO, Skipping GEOREF 'name' due to above problem

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Due to  some  problem  while  reading  the  specified  GEOREF,
      processing  can  not continue and so it has been skipped in order to proceed
      on to any remaining GEOREFs in the current coverage.

  ZEROFEAT, File contained no features.  It has been deleted

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The message reports that no features were written to  the  IFF
      file  and hence it was deleted.  This may well be the case if no features of
      the selected classes were present in the tile, or if  the  features  in  the
      tile did not match any entries in the Feature Code Table.  DCW data contains
      only those tiles which contain any data and so, for example,  a  tile  would
      not exist if it was located in the middle of an ocean.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  If you expected features to be present in  the  tile  for  the
      selected feature classes then check that all the primary and secondary names
      and values are present in the Feature Code Table so that they will match the
      features.

  These messages are output when an error  has  occurred  that  can  be  corrected
  immediately by the user or that the program will attempt to overcome.

  8BITASCII, FSN 'number' text string has 8 bit ASCII character

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The program expects all text characters to be in  7-bit  ASCII
      form  and  an  8-bit ASCII character was encountered (ie ASCII value greater
      than 127).

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Examine the text entry of the reported feature to identify the
      offending  character.   Since  this  should  not  occur in DCW, it should be
      removed using IPATCH/WRITE.

  ACTYPE, Invalid AC type on line 'number'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The attribute type present on the reported line contained  too
      many  characters  or  was  of  the wrong type.  The only permitted attribute
      types are of type integer (I), date (D) or text (T).

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Change the offending line so that the AC type is valid.

  BADDIR, Directory 'dir-name' does not exist or is read-only

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The directory reported cannot be used as a destination for the
      IFF files because it does not exist or it is read-only.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Enter the name of a directory which both  exists  and  can  be
      written to.

  BADSUBTILE, GEOREF 'geo-type' has invalid sub-tile

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The sub-tile following the reported GEOREF was invalid.   Each
      DCW GEOREF is split into 9 sub-tiles which are referenced 11 to 33 where the
      first digit applies to longitude and the second to latitude.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Enter the command again but with a legal GEOREF sub-tile.

  BADTYPE, Attribute 'name' is of type 'char' but in AC file as type 'char'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The attribute reported matched one in the Attribute Code  file
      but  was of the wrong type.  The true type as define in the VPF table header
      is used.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Make a note of the true type and correct it in  the  Attribute
      Code file.

  CANTDESEL, Cannot deselect individual GEOREFs when all selected

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Since there is a limit on the  number  of  individual  GEOREFs
      allowed,  it  is  not possible to deselect individual ones when they are all
      selected as it may still exceed  the  limit.   There  are  288  (24  by  12)
      potential GEOREFs and if, for example, one was deselected it is not possible
      to maintain a list of 287 individual one as  this  would  still  exceed  the
      limit.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  If a large number of GEOREFs (but not all) are required to  be
      extracted and the number of individual GEOREFs is not sufficient, simply run
      the program as many times as required.

  CANTGO, Must specify 'missing-item' before you can GO

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The  GO  command  was  given  before  the  minimum  number  of
      options/selections  have  been  made.  Before processing can begin, you must
      have specified the library, device, target directory, Feature Code Table and
      at least one feature class type.  The GO command was ignored.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Specify the missing requirement and GO again.

  CANTREAD, Unable to read 'column-type' from line 'line-no'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The entry type reported could not be read from a line  of  the
      file.   This  failure  could  be  due  to  trying to interpret a string as a
      number, for example.  NOTE:  This will result  in  the  line  being  omitted
      which  may  cause  missing  features  or ACs on features since they will not
      match.  Ideally, you should have no warnings when reading the AC and FC file
      to ensure all lines have been read.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Examine the offending line, amend the appropriate  column  and
      run the program again.

  CANTSPAWN, Unable to spawn command, returning to DCW2I

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The command attempting to be spawned failed for some reason.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  This messages should be accompanied by another which may  give
      a clue as to nature of the problem.

  CODEXT, FSN 'number' text string has code extension character

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The program has encountered a code extension character in  the
      reported  FSN.  These characters are escape (ESC - ASCII 27), shift in (SI -
      ASCII 14) and shift out (SO - ASCII 15) and are used to allow  extension  to
      other alphabets.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Examine the text entry of the reported feature to identify the
      offending  character.   Since  this  should  not  occur in DCW, it should be
      removed using IPATCH/WRITE.

  COVINVALID, Coverage 'cover-name' is not available for library 'library-name'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Each DCW library has a certain set of  valid  coverages  which
      may  be selected and an attempt was made to select an unavailable one from a
      library.

  GEOINVALID, GEOREF 'georef-name' is not valid

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The GEOREF reported is not a valid one as defined by  the  DCW
      Product Specification.  A valid GEOREF consists of two characters; the first
      represents the  longitude  and  the  second  is  the  latitude.   Acceptable
      longitude  values are A to Z (except I and O) and acceptable latitude values
      are A to M (except I).

  GIVELIB, Coverages dependent on library.  Select library first

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An attempt was made to make a coverage  selection  before  the
      library  has  been  selected.  Since the browse coverages are different from
      the other coverages, the library must be known in advance.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Select the library before any coverages.

  ILLEGALDIR, That is not a valid directory name

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The directory following the TARGET command could not be parsed
      as a valid directory.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Enter the command again but with a legal directory name.

  INVDEV, Invalid device name

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The device name given is  invalid.   No  directory,  filename,
      extension  or  version is permitted when giving the device name.  Node names
      are permitted and the device should end with a colon.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  In order for the program to read  commands  from  an  indirect
      file it must be invoked by typing '@' followed by the file name.

  NOGEOS, Individual GEOREFs not available for BROWSE library

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An attempt was made to  make  a  GEOREF  selection  while  the
      BROWSE  map is selected.  Since individual GEOREFs are not available for the
      BROWSE map, the command has been ignored.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Do not attempt to select any GEOREFs from the BROWSE library.

  NONAME, No 'type' name given

      [1mExplanation:[0m  This message is used for  two  purposes.   Either  the  SELECT
      COVER  or the SELECT GEOREF command was not followed by a coverage or GEOREF
      name.  The command has been ignored.

  NOSUCHCOV, Selected coverage 'name' does not exist for library 'name'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The  selected  coverage  is  not  available  for  the  library
      specified.   For  example,  coverage  VG (vegetation) only exists in DCW for
      library NOAMER (North America)

      have given the correct library name and have mounted the appropriate CD-ROM.

  NUMPTS, Too 'amount' points for feature class - feature ignored

      [1mExplanation:[0m  This is a two-fold message which reports that there are either
      too  few  or  too many points for the type of feature.  Area features should
      contain more than 4 coordinate pairs, line features should contain at  least
      2, point and text features should only contain one.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Since it is very difficult to check the feature  in  question,
      you  may  wish  to contact Laser-Scan stating the offending tile and classes
      used.

  OUTOFRANGE, 'code-type' value of 'value' out of range on line 'number'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The reported code-type (AC code or feature  code)  is  out  of
      range in the Feature/Attribute Code file.  The valid range for these is from

  TABLEFAIL, Failed to read table 'name'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  A problem occurred while reading the  specified  table.   This
      could  be  due to any number of things and since the VPF database tables are
      binary it is quite difficult to find what is wrong with a table.

      Laser-Scan.

  TILENOTSEL, Tile 'sub-tile' of GEOREF 'geo-tile' not selected

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An attempt was made to deselect a  sub-tile  of  a  particular
      GEOREF which has not previously been selected.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Only try and deselect those tiles which have  previously  been
      selected.

  TOOMANY, Only 'max' individual GEOREFs allowed

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Too many GEOREFs were selected.  Most of the time, all GEOREFs
      will  be  required  but  for testing purposes over small areas, a few can be
      extracted.  Refer to the DCW2I documentation for the current  limit  on  the
      number of individual GEOREFs allowed.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  If the number of individual GEOREFs  is  not  sufficient,  the
      program should be run as many times as required.

  TOOMANYEDGES, More than 'number' edges in face.  Face edges do not close

      [1mExplanation:[0m  This problem is caused when building up  a  list  of  all  the
      edges  which  constitute  an  area feature.  In doing so, it is necessary to
      follow the pointers from one edge to another until it cycles around  to  the
      start  edge  again, thus closing the feature.  For some reason (often caused
      by edges with the same face on both  sides)  the  edges  followed  have  not
      cycled  back  to  the beginning after the number of reported edges.  This is
      most likely to be a problem in the left or right edge keys and will be  very
      hard  cure  since  the data is binary and cannot easily be edited even if it
      were copied onto a disk so that the files could be written to.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Please contact the donor of the data, stating  which  tile  is
      corrupt.   Since  no  feature is written to the IFF file and identifying the
      DCW feature in the VPF table would not help, this message should be ignored.
      The  user  will  know  in  which  GEOREF  tile this occurred which should be
      inspected in LITES2.

  TWOCHARS, Two characters are required for 'type' name

      [1mExplanation:[0m  A coverage or GEOREF name was entered which  did  not  contain
      exactly  two  characters.   Refer  to  the DCW2I documentation for a list of
      valid coverage names and GEOREFs

  TWODANGLES, Two dangling edges together in area with FSN 'number'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  When building up a  list  of  edges  which  comprise  an  area
      feature,  two  dangling  edges (edges with the same face on both sides) have
      been  found,  one  after  the  other.   These  edges  can  cause   problems,
      particularly  if  they  are  digitised in different directions.  The program
      will ignore the dangling edges in  preference  for  a  normal  edge  on  the
      perimeter  of the area in the hope that it will close properly.  It is often
      the case that two or more dangling edges can be thrown away with no loss  of
      data,  but  there  may be cases where two dangles lead to a hole in the area
      which could be lost and so we recommend that the user performs the following
      action.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Examine the reported area feature in LITES2 for this tile  and
      compare  it  with the DCW data held on CD-ROM which can be displayed on a PC
      using the VPFVIEW software, which accompanies the DCW package.

  UNEXPEND, unexpected end of indirect command file detected - returning to
      terminal input

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The end-of-file was detected when reading the indirect command
      file.   The  usual way of telling the program to return to interactive input
      is by having a RETURN command on the end and one was not found.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  All the commands in the file will have been  executed  and  so
      the  RETURN  command  may be omitted but for a tidy exit you should edit the
      command file to ensure that there is a RETURN command at the end.   However,
      a  RETURN  command  is  not  required after a GO because this terminates the
      program when complete.

  INVFCS, Invalid FCS table format

      [1mExplanation:[0m  In order to  read  the  FCS  successfully,  the  table  should
      contain fields labelled TABLE1, TABLE2, FOREIGN_KEY and PRIMARY_KEY.  One or

  NOFREELUN, No free logical unit numbers

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Before any file can be opened, it has to be assigned a logical

  NOID, No 'ID' in header definition

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The current table being read was  found  to  contain  no  'ID'
      field  in the header section.  This is invalid since every table should have
      a first field called 'ID'.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  This would indicate a problem in the content of the VPF table.
      It  may be possible to copy the relevant files from the CD-ROM to a disk and
      edit the offending file since the header definition is of text format.  Note
      that  in  order for the program to accept the device as valid, the directory
      structure must be identical to that of the CD-ROM.

  NOSUCHFILE, File 'name' does not exist

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The file is specified is essential for use in this part of the
      processing and could not be found on the CD-ROM.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  This would indicate a problem in the structure or  content  of

      Specification to  determine  if  the  file  should  exist  for  the  current
      coverage.   If it is missing for the CD-ROM, you should contact the donor of
      the DCW data, otherwise it may indicate a problem with the program  and  you
      should contact Laser-Scan.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
