            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            RESTRICTIONS        - a summary of restrictions on the use of

                                  and suggested user action given. The messages
                                  are divided into sections according to message
                                  severity within which the messages are ordered

            SXF stands for Scandinavian Transfer  Format,  Laser-Scan's  term  for
            ....

            I2SXF provides a translation from Laser-Scan's Internal Feature Format
            (IFF)  to  a subset of SXF.  For a brief comparison of the way IFF and
            SXF regard data, see the section on DATA PREPARATION below.

            I2SXF output is made to disk file.

            Each disk file contains the output from one IFF file.

            These files may then be output to magnetic tape using  either  of  the
            VAX  programs BACKUP or EXCHANGE - the former is intended for transfer
            between VAXes, and the latter provides an ANSI  standard  tape  format
            (it  replaces  the  RSX  utility FLX on VAXes with VMS version 4.0 and
            up).  Consult the relevant Digital manuals for more details  of  these
            utilities.

            IFF is a feature  oriented  data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            The customer should supply a list of how the various forms of data  on
            the  map(s)  are  to be output.  This should describe for each type of
            data what line weight, style and colour  should  be  used,  what  text
            fonts and sizes are required, what symbols (cells) are to be used, and
            how to digitise them, and so on.

            For digitising within IFF, feature codes must be assigned  to  all  of
            these  data-types,  and  an FRT file (together with SRI and TRI files)
            created.

            Care should be taken  in  considering  what  graphical  type  the  IFF
            features  should  have  -  see  the section 'Comparison of SXD and FRT
            files' below.

            In some cases, there may not be an obvious linkage between the way the
            data-type  is  specified in the customer specification, and the way it
            would most naturally be digitised.  Sometimes it may be  necessary  to
            use a small program to post-process the data before outputting to SXF.
            The  small  program  would  be  written  purely   for   a   particular
            application,  in  order  to make the digitising and editing operations
            easier.

            Since customer requirements for SXF are likely to vary by quite a lot,
            care must be taken in designing the flowline for producing the data to
            be output to SXF, and small programs to process the data before output
            may often be required.

            Within the IFF file, coordinates are stored  relative  to  the  bottom
            left  hand  corner  of  the sheet, the local origin.  This allows more
            accuracy within the IFF file.  In modern IFF files, the coordinates of
            that  local  origin  are then stored in the map descriptor (MD) entry,
            and the absolute coordinates of a feature can be  obtained  by  adding

  /FC=(integer[,...])

          - causes I2SXF  to  output  only  those  IFF  features  which  have  the
            specified  feature  code(s).   The  /FC  qualifier will accept single,
            multiple or ranges of feature code arguments.  Ranges may be specified
            with  starting and ending feature codes that are separated by a colon,
            for example /FC=56:58.  When specifying more than one range of feature
            codes,  separate each range with a comma, for example /FC=(1:5,56:89).
            The maximum number of feature codes which may be specified is 1024.

  /FRT[=file-spec]
  /NOFRT

          - specifies an FRT file which the program will read and use to interpret
            non-standard CB attributes in IFF revision 1 input files.  /FRT is not
            necessary for IFF revision 0 input files.  The FRT file-spec is parsed
            against  the  default  LSL$FRT:'name'.FRT  where  'name'  is  the name
            specified with /PARAMETER.

  /LAYER=(integer[,...])

          - causes I2SXF to output only  those  IFF  features  which  are  in  the
            specified layer(s).  The /LAYER qualifier will accept single, multiple
            or ranges of layer arguments.  Ranges may be specified  with  starting
            and  ending  layers  that  are  separated  by  a  colon,  for  example
            /LAYER=3:5.  When specifying more than one range of  layers,  separate
            each  range with a comma, for example /LAYER=(1:5,12:14).  The maximum
            number of layers which may be specified is 1024.

  /LOG
  /NOLOG

          - causes supplementary messages to be sent to SYS$OUTPUT.  Supplementary
            messages  are  generated  when  a  file  is successfully opened, and a
            reassuring message is output each time a new IFF layer is  encountered
            in the input file.

  /PARAMETER=file-spec

          - specifies the IFF parameter file, which defines the transformation  of
            feature  codes  in  the  IFF data to TRF codes in the output SXF data.
            This qualifier is mandatory, and the  parameter  file-spec  is  parsed
            from the default LSL$LOOKUP:I2SXF.I2SXF_PAR.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

            I2SXF reads an IFF file containing a single map and  produces  an  SXF
            output  file.   It  deduces  the  translation  necessary  by  using  a
            parameter file.

            [1mIFF[0m [1mfile[0m

            The IFF file should conform to the  standards  set  out  in  the  DATA
            PREPARATION section under the heading 'Preparation for digitising data
            to be output to SXF'.

            The revision level of the IFF files can be 0 or 1.  Note, however that
            an  FRT  file  should  also be specified if any of the input files are
            revision level 1.

            [1mParameter[0m [1mfile[0m

            This file contains the feature description table which  describes  the
            translations required to produce SXF data from IFF data.  The file can
            also contain ......  The format of the table is described in the  DATA
            PREPARATION section under the heading 'The SXF Parameter File', and it
            will probably have been set up by the LAMPS system manager and  remain
            relatively static at most installations.

            [1mUsing[0m [1mthe[0m [1mprogram[0m

            Normal use of the program is in batch mode - that is, running it via a
            batch command file, submitted with the SUBMIT command.  However, it is
            also possible to run the program interactively, although since it  can
            take  a long time to translate an IFF file this is not necessarily the
            best method.

            It is probable that the symbol I2SXF will have been set up to  include
            at  least  the /PARAMETER and possibly the /FRT qualifiers, so you may
            only need to give the input IFF file and output SXF file.

            [1mHow[0m [1mthe[0m [1mprogram[0m [1mworks[0m

            Once the program has been invoked and the  command  line  successfully
            read,  a  summary  of  the inputs and outputs is typed.  The parameter
            file is then read in, and if that  was  successful  the  IFF  file  is
            opened.

            When all applicable data has been output  to  the  drawing  file,  the
            program will exit.

            the appropriate TRF codes, except those which have not been defined in
            the parameter file.  A warning message  is  output  for  each  feature
            whose feature code is undefined, and the feature is ignored.  The /LOG

      been  read  from  the  parameter file.  The LINEINPAR message indicating the
      parameter file line number will follow, and the  program  will  continue  to
      read the file, ignoring this line.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Amend the feature code in the parameter file, and if necessary
      run the program again.

  ENDINMAP, end of IFF file inside map

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The end of the IFF file was reached unexpectedly,  before  the
      end of map (EM) entry had been found.  The map data will have been correctly
      processed, but this  message  may  indicate  that  the  IFF  file  had  been
      improperly closed by a previous process, and some data may be missing.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Examine the file using LITES2 to determine  the  integrity  of
      the  data, and run the IMP utility IINFO to look at the history of the file.
      If none of the data is missing, run IMEND on the  IFF  file  to  insert  the
      missing  entries  at  the  end.  Otherwise, the history may indicate at what
      stage things went wrong.

  UNKCMD, unknown command "'command'"

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The given command in the parameter file  was  not  recognised.
      The LINEINPAR message indicating the parameter file line number will follow,
      and the program will continue to read the file, ignoring this line.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  This message is most likely due to an error in the program and
      should be reported to Laser-Scan.

  UNKFC, FC 'fc' has not been defined, FSN 'fsn' ignored

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The given feature code in the  IFF  file  was  not  recognised
      because  it  has  not  been  defined  in the parameter file.  The feature is
      ignored and processing continues.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  If the feature code is wanted, it should  be  defined  in  the
      parameter file and the program run again.

  These messages indicate an error in processing which will cause the  program  to
  terminate.   The  most  likely  causes  are a corrupt or otherwise invalid input
  file, or an error related to command line processing and file manipulation.

  ERRCLOPAR, error closing parameter file 'file-spec'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The parameter file could not be closed.  An additional  LSLLIB
      message will follow, giving the reason for the failure.  If this is due to a
      system error, the system error message will also appear.  The program  exits
      immediately.

  ERROPNPAR, error opening parameter file 'file-spec'

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The parameter file could not be opened.  An additional  LSLLIB
      message will follow, giving the reason for the failure.  If this is due to a

      There may be a simple remedy, e.g.  a change in the directory specification.
      Alternatively, this error could be due to a more serious problem such  as  a
      system failure, and in that case the System Manager may have to be informed.

  ERRRDFRT, error reading FRT file 'file-spec'

  IFFCLOERR, cannot close IFF file

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The IFF file could not be  closed.   This  may  be  due  to  a
      previous  IFF  error,  or  it may indicate a more serious system error.  The
      message will be preceded by an IFF library  message  which  will  give  more
      details, including a two-character code.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Look up the IFF error code  in  the  IFFLIB  Reference  Manual
      (part of the MAPPING package documentation) and take the appropriate action.

  NORA, cannot find RA entry in IFF file

      [1mExplanation:[0m  Before processing the map data, I2SXF has to  set  the  output
      limits.  These values are obtained from the RAnge entry in the IFF file, and
      if the entry is not found this message appears, indicating that the IFF file
      is invalid and therefore cannot be used.  The program exits immediately.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Look at the IFF file using the IMP utility IPATCH, in order to
      ascertain  the  level of corruption.  The HIstory entry may indicate how the
      IFF file came to have no RA entry.

  TABLEFULL, translation table full (maximum entries 'number')

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The stated limit has been reached while reading in translation
      table entries from the parameter file.

      [1mUser[0m [1maction:[0m  Amend the translation table in the parameter file, so that the
      number  of  entries  does  not  exceed the maximum.  If a larger translation
      table is an  ongoing  requirement,  please  submit  an  SPR  to  Laser-Scan,
      requesting an increase in the limit.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
