            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            RESTRICTIONS        - a summary of restrictions on the use of

            The Military Survey Data Structure (MSDS)  exchange  format  is  a  UK
            interim  format  for  the  exchange of topologically structured vector
            digital data.  It will be replaced when the  NATO  Digital  Geographic
            Information Working Group (DGIWG) standards are complete.

            The MSDS format expected is an ASCII  text  format,  as  described  to
            Laser-Scan  in  the  document  "MIL SVY DATA STRUCTURE (MSDS) EXCHANGE
            FORMAT".

            The IFF files produced are intended for processing directly to produce
            graphic  output.   For  more information on the IFF file structure see
            the [1mIFF[0m [1mUser's[0m [1mGuide[0m of the Laser-Scan MAPPING package documentation.

            MSDS data comes in an ASCII file.  This will usually be a ANSI file on
            magnetic  tape.   The record length is variable, with a maximum length
            of 4096 bytes.  Each input MSDS file will be output to one IFF file.

            MSDS consists of topologically structured data gathered into  "THEMES"
            or  layers.   The  data within a THEME is divided into two levels, the
            feature level and the spatial level.  The feature level  combines  the
            resulting  spatial  entities  with  attribute data to represent a real
            world geographic entity.

            There are three spatial entities, which  each  relate  directly  to  a
            feature type.  These are:

            1.  Node  -  a  zero-dimensional   entity,   representing   a   single
                significant  coordinate.   Nodes  are  related  directly  to Point
                features.

            2.  EDGE - a one-dimensional entity representing a set of coordinates.
                Line  features consist of one or more connected edges.  Edges also
                bound the third spatial entity:

            3.  FACE - a two-dimensional entity representing the largest connected
                area, enclosed by oriented edges.  Area features consist of one or
                more faces that share a common boundary.

            The simple features (points, lines and areas) can  be  combined,  with
            further attribute data to form complex features.

            The coordinates in MSDS are stored as integer coordinates, usually  as
            centimetres  on  the projection.  X,Y and Z values are stored for each
            point.

  FORMAT DESCRIPTION                                                  17 June 1991

            IFF is a feature  oriented  data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            MSDS format shares this concept of a 'feature', at the simple  feature
            level.   Each  simple feature has a name that can be related to an IFF
            feature code.  This translation is effected by a simple  lookup  table
            that  relates  the MSDS feature names with IFF feature codes.  Complex
            features can be defined in MSDS in terms of simple features,  but  are
            ignored in the conversion to IFF.

            MSDS  has  several  concepts  which  have  no  direct  equivalence  in
            unstructured  feature-based IFF files.  The MSDS2I program is intended
            for producing IFF files for graphic display and hardcopy  output,  and
            hence  does  not  attempt  to  preserve such MSDS properties as shared
            geometry or complex features.  It would be  possible  to  convert  the
            concept  of  THEMEs into LAYERs in IFF, but at the moment all features
            are simply written to layer 1 in the IFF file.

  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

            MSDS2I converts MSDS files into IFF format.  The input is  a  standard
            ASCII file, which may be a disk file or an ANSI file on magnetic tape.

                                             NOTE

                    The MSDS format allows files with records  up  to  the
                    block size of 4096 bytes.  While the program MSDS2I is
                    happy to deal with these records some  difficulty  has
                    been  experienced  in  transferring files with records
                    longer than 2048 bytes from tape  to  disk.   The  VMS
                    utilities  COPY  and  CONVERT  will not deal with such
                    files.  Indeed such files cannot be "TYPED".


            In converting MSDS data to IFF, the hierarchical nature of the data is
            lost,  and  the  THEME  and  COMPLEX FEATURE levels of abstraction are
            ignored.

            The SIMPLE features (areas, lines and points) of  the  MSDS  data  are
            written  into  one  IFF layer with a feature code based on the feature
            name.  The relationship between the MSDS  feature  name  and  the  IFF
            feature code is contained in a translation file.  The default name for
            this file is LSL$LOOKUP:MSDS.TRAN, but this default may be  overridden
            by   the   /TRANSLATION  switch.   An  example  file  is  supplied  in
            LSL$PUBLIC_ROOT:[CONVERT.LOOKUP] along with corresponding FRT and  SRI
            files  (MSDS.FRT  and  MSDS.SRI).   The TRI file is immaterial as MSDS
            does not support text features.

            If the program fails to find the MSDS names of the simple features  in
            the  translation  file, then these features are not transferred to the
            IFF file.  The number of features so ignored are listed as  a  warning
            message.   This  mechanism  may be used as a method of selecting which
            MSDS features to convert.

            Attributes associated with the MSDS features, and  their  values,  are
            stored  in  the text part of type 6 ACs in IFF features.  This is done
            with no interpretation of the attribute codes or their values.

            MSDS2I requires that the following logical names are set up:

            1.  LSL$MSDS:   - this should point to the directory (or device)  that
                contains  the  MSDS file to be converted.  In particular this may,
                conveniently point to the magnetic tape drive.  (e.g.  MUA0:)

            2.  LSL$LOOKUP: - this should point to the  directory  containing  the
                MSDS  translation  file  which  is  to be used for converting MSDS
                feature names to IFF feature codes.

            3.  LSL$IF:     - this should be set up to point  to  a  directory  to
                which the IFF file is to be written.


            Any of these  three  logical  names  may  be  overridden  by  explicit
            specification of the directory concerned.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
