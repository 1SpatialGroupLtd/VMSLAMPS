            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            RESTRICTIONS        - a summary of restrictions on the use of

            EXAMPLES            - annotated examples of utility useage.

            MESSAGES            - all classes of message are listed and described
                                  and suggested user action given. The messages
                                  are divided into sections according to message
                                  severity within which the messages are ordered
                                  alphabetically by message mnemonic.

            CEDD is a format devised by the Committee for the Exchange of  Digital
            Data  as  a  tape  transfer  format for the International Hydrographic
            Organisation  (I.H.0.),  derived  in  the  search  for   a   versatile
            electronic  chart  transfer  mechanism.   There  are two types of data
            structure  supported  at  present:   sequential,  and  chain-node   or
            structured.   At  present  IFF  files  are  sequential  in  format and
            therefore only permit the exchange of this  format  to  and  from  IFF
            files, although chain-node structured CEDD files can be read to IFF.

            This section gives a  brief  description  of  the  CEDD  data  format.
            Further details may be found in the I.H.O.  Format for the Exchange of
            Digital Hydrographic Data, November 1986.

            The CEDD format stores the feature  descriptions  and  the  coordinate
            information separately to permit multiple association between features
            and coordinates, and to facilitate the modification  of  the  dataset.
            The format allows up to 999,999 separate features, each referencing up
            to 999 of  the  999,999  allowable  separate  segments  of  coordinate
            information.   Each  segment  can  belong  to  up  to 99 features, and
            consist of  either  two  (x,y)  or  three  (x,y,z)  dimensional  data,
            depending on the existence of a vertical units qualifier in the header
            record.  This means that all the  data  in  the  file  must  be  three
            dimensional  even if most of the third coordinates are unused and left
            blank.

            If the dataset  contains  sequential  data  there  must  a  one-to-one
            correspondence between feature and segment, both of which will usually
            have the same ID numbers, except for depth soundings in which a single
            feature  can  be  associated  with  up  to  999 segments, each segment
            containing up to  99,999  points  of  separate  depth  soundings.   (A
            different  feature  is  required only for soundings from each separate
            source).  Soundings should therefore be the last features and segments
            in a dataset, or be included in a separate dataset.

            If the dataset contains chain-node structured data there is no  longer
            any  requirement  for  the one-to-one relationship, and a feature will
            consist of several (up to 999) segments, and a segment will belong  to
            several (up to 99) features.

            Tape files must be  on  9  track,  6250  or  1600  bpi,  with  a  ANSI
            (X3.27-1978)  structure  that  should  enable  the files on tape to be
            treated as if they were normal files obeying the usual  VMS  commands,
            so  that  files  may  be  copied  to  disc  with the COPY command, and
            processed  from  disc,  one  file   at   a   time.    I2CEDD   creates
            variable-length  record  blocks  so  that each logical record block is
            preceded by a 4-byte record control word (RCW) giving  the  length  in
            bytes of the record, including the 4 bytes of the RCW.

            The VOLUME, HEADER and EOF label records  are  those  created  by  the
            operating  system  when  copying to tape.  Tape files may contain many
            datasets, each enclosed by a HEADER  and  EOF  label,  with  the  last
            dataset followed by the EOT marker of two tapemarks.

            The CEDD data structure consists of a  basic  1980  character  logical
            data  record  which  is  filled  with  ASCII  7 bit (ISO Standard 646)
            characters.  All alphabetic characters are upper case except for  text
            fields in the feature records and text records.

            There  are  four  types  of  data  logical   record:    DSI   (DataSet
            Identifier), FEAture records, SEGment records and an optional TXT text
            record.  Each is composed of as many  1980  character  blocks  as  are
            required  to contain all the data.  They must exist in the order given
            above.  Each block in the record is preceded by a 8  character  header
            comprising  a 3 character block identifier label of DSI, FEA, SEG, TXT
            for each of the 4 types of data record, followed by a  5  digit  block
            identifier  number,  numbered  in  sequence  through  all  the  blocks
            belonging to that record.   The  remaining  1972  characters  (9-1980)
            contain the CEDD data, which is continued into character 9 of the next
            block if required.

            The last block in each record type is padded with ASCII  'DEL'  (Octal
            177)  padding  character.   Any  unused fields in any block are filled
            with ASCII blank/space (Octal 40) characters.  All numeric fields  are
            right  justified  with either leading spaces or zeroes, with any minus
            sign immediately preceeding the first digit.   All  alphabetic  fields
            are left justified with trailing spaces.

            A CEDD file on disc, or on a tape MOUNTed non-foreign so that any tape
            labels  become  transparent to the user, will just consist of the four
            types of logical data record.

            The records between the lines may be repeated multiple times on a tape
            for  each  dataset  on  the  tape  between the VOL label and the final
            tapemarks.  A Header (HDR1)  record  indicates  the  start  of  a  new
            dataset.   The  tape header labels are followed by a string of logical
            data records:  DSI, FEA, SEG and TXT (optional).

            The DSI record contains all the dataset specific information  such  as
            dataset   latitude   and   longitude   origin,   extents,   projection
            information, dataset generation,  preparation  and  history,  and  the
            units  of  measurement.   It also contains any (optional) registration
            points relating latitude  and  longitude  coordinates  to  control  or
            registration points, and accuracy outlines containing further accuracy
            data pertaining to different areas of the map.

            All geographic coordinates are stored as (D)DDMMSSSSH, where (D)DD  is
            the degrees, MM is the minutes and SSSS is the number of hundredths of
            seconds, followed by a hemisphere character  (N,S,E,W).   This  format
            applies  to  the  file origin, extents, and any registration point and
            accuracy outline coordinates that may be present.  The location of the
            file  origin is always to the South West of all points in the dataset.
            The segments contain coordinates which  are  always  stored  as  delta
            values  which are the positive difference between this file origin (or
            zero if not specified) and the datapoint.

            This record must be followed by a series of FEAture records containing
            information  on the structure and descriptive attributes for each CEDD
            feature, together with a list of references to the coordinate segments
            belonging  to  each feature in the record.  Each feature has a feature
            sub-record consisting of the feature ID,  its  type  (point,  line  or
            area), a header block count (at present equal to 4), the actual header
            block consisting of 4x40 characters, the number of segments  belonging
            to  the  feature  and finally, for each segment, the segment direction
            and ID.  At present there are 6  feature  codes  used  for  IFF  files
            created  from CEDD data:  FC = 1 for the layer 0 enclosing feature, FC
            = 2 for registration points in layer 0, FC = 3 for  accuracy  outlines
            in  layer  0,  FC  =  4  for  any  point features, FC = 5 for any line
            features and FC = 6 for any area features.  Point features are treated
            as  symbol  strings  rather than simple points because of the way CEDD
            can accommodate many point objects in a single feature.

            The  feature  header  blocks  contain  information  relevant  to   the
            particular  feature  such  as  its  history,  generation, accuracy and
            scale.  It also contains the feature's FACS (Feature Attribute  Coding
            Scheme) code which describes the type of feature it is, which together
            with the values in the feature FACS attribute  fields  giving  further
            information  on  the  feature, describes how to display it.  There are
            also text fields in which to store further descriptive information.

            The feature records are followed by the SEGment records containing the
            actual  coordinates  of  the features, and a list of references to the
            features to which the coordinates belong.  Each segment has a  segment
            subrecord  consisting  of  the  segment  ID, the number of features to

            which the segment belongs, followed by, for each feature, the  feature
            ID  and  its  orientation.   Next  comes  the actual coordinate values
            consisting of the number of points  and  then  the  x,  y,  (z)  delta
            values.   Z  values will only occur if the vertical units field in the
            DSI record contains an entry, otherwise all points in the dataset will
            have  only  x,  y  coordinates.  If this a geographic dataset the x, y
            coordinates are delta latitude and longitude values referenced to  the
            file  origin  in the DSI record.  Any Z values represent the elevation
            with respect to the vertical datum in the DSI record.

            An optional text record (TXT)  is  provided  to  contain  any  textual
            information  relevant  to  the entire dataset, with the number of text
            characters followed by the actual text.

            IFF is a feature  oriented  data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            A CEDD file similarly contains graphical data on a per-feature  basis,
            primarily  devised for hydrographic information in data records, which
            are similar in concept to IFF features.

            A CEDD file contains header information, held in one  or  more  header
            blocks,  and  logical data records, each one holding information about
            the features, and  further  records  for  the  coordinate  information
            belonging  to these features.  There is a further optional text record
            to contain information relevant to the whole dataset.

            In an IFF file, as  created  by  CEDD2I  or  to  be  read  by  I2CEDD,
            information   is   held   in  features.   Every  feature,  whether  it
            corresponds to the CEDD header or the logical  data  record  features,
            contains  a  number  of  Ancillary  Code  (AC) entries, as well as the
            coordinates in  ST  (for  two  dimensional  data)  or  ZS  (for  three
            dimensional  data)  entries.   There  must be for each feature type an
            entry in the FRT table descibing how each feature is to be  displayed.
            Each  AC  entry  must  have  an  ACD  entry  in  this same FRT, with a
            descriptive  name  by   which   the   programs   refer   to   the   AC
            cross-referenced  to  the  AC  type number.  Any AC may one be of five
            types:  integer, real, character (containing up to 4 characters), date
            (containing an integer number of days which will be converted to a VMS
            standard date format) or time (not used in IFFCEDD).  If a CEDD  field
            contains  more  than  4  characters  to  be stored in an AC entry, the
            optional text string field for the AC will be used which can contain a
            maximum   of   20   characters.   Note  that  the  CEDD  FRT  contains
            approximately 250 ACD entries, and so before any programs that  access
            the  CEDD  FRT  are  run,  a  logical  name  must  be set up:  "DEFINE
            LSL$FRT_ACDMAX 300" to set a number large enough  to  accommodate  all
            the entries.

            To create a full CEDD file  the  contents  of  the  DSI  header  block
            information should be held in the AC's belonging to a single enclosing
            area feature in layer 0 of the IFF file.  For this header feature, the
            ST  coordinate  entry  should contain the coordinates that enclose the
            entire map.   Geographic  IFF  units  allowed  are  radians,  degrees,
            seconds  or  tenths  of  seconds,  and  to  create an IFF file that is
            suitable for ITRANS input, the CEDD units for  a  geographic  map  are
            converted into one of these units.

            Also in layer 0 can be put any registration point features with  their
            AC's   containing   the  alignment  information  relating  real  world
            coordinates (eg.  latitude and longitude) to map or digitising points.
            If   the   map   is  geographic  (ie.   latitude  and  longitude)  the
            registration point feature  ST  entry  contains  the  lat/long  values
            converted  into IFF units.  Otherwise the ST or ZS entries contain the
            actual registration coordinates  in  the  original  CEDD  file  units.
            There  may  also  be  accuracy  outline  area  features which describe
            further accuracy information for selected regions  of  the  map,  with
            their   AC's   containing   the  accuracy  information  and  whose  ST
            coordinates contain the positions of the region boundary in  lat/long.
            converted into IFF units.

            The contents of features  for  the  CEDD  data  records  are  held  in
            separate  features  in layer 1 (or greater) of the IFF file, and their
            AC entries should contain all the attribute information  necesary  for
            the  CEDD  feature header blocks if a full CEDD file is to be created.
            If these entries do not exist in either the normal  features,  or  the
            layer  0  features,  the CEDD file will be created by I2CEDD, but will
            have most of its data fields left blank.

            The contents of CEDD header and data record fields, with the exception
            of  longitude  and  latitude  values,  are held in Ancillary Code (AC)
            entries when they are transferred to IFF files.

            The programs I2CEDD and CEDD2I always refer to the  ACs  by  the  same
            names,  so allowing the user to determine which code is used in the AC
            entries in the IFF file by supplying a suitable Feature Representation
            Table  (FRT)  file.   The FRT file will be read by the programs, which
            then use it to determine the AC codes corresponding to each  AC  name.
            Full  details  of the preparation and use of FRT files can be found in
            the Laser-Scan 'FRT User Guide'.

            Some fields, for example those containing ID numbers  in  the  feature
            and  segment records are not transferred to the IFF file because their
            contents are invariant or because they are  made  superfluous  by  the
            nature or structure of an IFF file.

            The fields of the CEDD header are listed below,  with  the  names  and
            types  of  the  AC entries in which they are held in an equivalent IFF

            The symbol I2CEDD is normally set up as:

                      I2CEDD == "$lsl$exe:I2CEDD"

            and the program may then be used as if it were a normal VMS utility.

            [1mInput[0m [1mIFF[0m [1mfile[0m

            The input is an IFF file on disc, possibly containing CEDD  data.   It
            is  also  necessary to supply an FRT file containing the feature codes
            in the IFF file and the attribute codes containing any data to be used
            in  the  CEDD  file.  To completely specify the DSI record in the CEDD
            file, there should be a layer 0 in the IFF file containing some or all
            of three types of feature.

            The enclosing feature (FC = 1) describes the whole map,  and  contains
            the  AC's  containing  the  data  to  be inserted into the DSI record.
            Registration points (FC = 2) contain the data to align map coordinates
            to  real world coordinates in the AC's, and Accuracy outlines (FC = 3)
            are area features containing further accuracy data in the AC's.  There
            may  be  up to 999 registration points, and up to 99 accuracy outlines
            each with up to  99  coordinate  pairs.   Any  layer  0  features  not
            conforming to this structure will be ignored.

  UTILITY I2CEDD                                                      17 June 1991


            To enable a FACS (Feature Attribute Coding Scheme) feature code to  be
            given  to  the  output  CEDD  file, it must be supplied in the two ACD
            types as specified in the CEDD FRT file for each feature  in  the  IFF
            file,  and  the  rest  of  the information for the CEDD feature header
            blocks must exist in the AC entries for each feature.

            [1mOutput[0m [1mfile[0m

            The output file will be a CEDD file on disc or magnetic tape depending
            on  the  supplied output file specification.  The default action is to
            output a single CEDD file from a single  IFF  file,  selected  by  the
            input and output command line parameters.

            [1mProgram[0m [1maction[0m

            After decoding the  command  line,  opening  any  required  files  and
            initialising  the supplied FRT file, the program reads the IFF entries
            in sequence.

            Most of the IFF header entries are skipped over, except the  RA  range
            giving  the  map  extents, and the MD2 entry for all the required file
            information.  If either of  these  two  entries  are  absent,  serious
            errors  will  occur,  resulting  in major absences from the CEDD file.
            The first NO new overlay entry determines the  programs  next  action,
            whether to process layer 0 or to process the features.

            Any layer 0 is scanned for the expected three feature types, and their
            addresses  stored.   Any  other feature types here will give a warning
            and be ignored.  The enclosing feature is first processed, and the  AC
            entries  read  and  their information output to the relevant fields in
            the DSI record of the  CEDD  file.   Some  of  the  information  about
            vertical  measurements  is  only  available at this stage as IFF files
            have no provision for this type of information.

            The information from the IFF RA and MD2  entries  is  used  to  output
            further information to the DSI record, eg.  the latitude and longitude
            extents from the range, and the dataset origin, file units, projection
            etc.   from  the  MD2.  Also from the range is calculated an offset to
            ensure that there are no negative coordinates output  to  the  segment
            records  later,  and  a  scaling factor by which the offset coordinate
            values are multiplied to fit into the 6 digit coordinate field with as
            much dynamic range as possible.  After scanning the remaining features
            in the IFF file to determine whether we are  dealing  with  a  two  or
            three   dimensional  map,  and  finding  the  minimum  and  maximum  z
            coordinate value if relevant, similar  origin  shift  and  scaling  is
            calculated  for  the  vertical  coordinates.  If the IFF file is three
            dimensional without having any vertical information, vertical units of
            metres are assumed.

            With the main components  of  the  DSI  record  now  constructed,  the
            registration  points  and  accuracy  regions  in  layer 0 are read and
            appended to the DSI.  For the registration points the  x,y  geographic
            AC  coordinate  values  stored in integer IFF units are converted into
            latitude  and  longitude  and  output  with  the  x,  y  (and  z)  map
            registration  coordinates.   The accuracy region x and y values in IFF
            units are converted into  latitude  and  longitude  values.   The  DSI

  UTILITY I2CEDD                                                      17 June 1991


            record  is  then completed by padding with 'DEL' characters to the end
            of the 1980 character block.

            Having completed all the header information for CEDD, the IFF features
            are  again  read  in sequence, ignoring any further layer structuring,
            and the AC entries for each feature  used  to  construct  the  feature
            header  block.   The  graphical  type defined by the feature's feature
            code (FC) in the FRT file determines whether the feature  is  of  type
            point, line or area giving feature codes of 4, 5, 6 respectively.  The
            feature's position in the IFF file determines the ID  number,  and  as
            there  is  no  chain-node  structure  in a IFF file, the segment ID is
            identical to the feature ID with one segment per feature.

            The SEGment record must follow the FEAture record to contain the x,  y
            (and  z)  coordinate values belonging to the features.  The segment ID
            is the same as the feature ID to which it belongs, and is equal to the
            feature sequence number in the IFF file.

            Any specified text file is translated into the TXT record and appended
            to the segment record.  All files are then closed.

            The program produces messages giving information about  the  transfer,
            and  any  errors  or  difficulties  that  may  be encountered.  If the
            /DIAGNOSTICS qualifier is supplied, more detailed information  on  the
            transfer will be produced.

            The program checks that the IFF file is valid, and  any  discrepancies
            are  reported, and will in most cases cause the program to abandon the
            transfer of data.

  /DIAGNOSTICS
  /NODIAGNOSTICS (default)

            the progress of the CEDD to IFF file conversion.

  /DUMP [ = file-spec ]
  /NODUMP (default)

          - if specified, a dump of each tape block is  output  to  the  specified
            file, or to SYS$OUTPUT if no file specification is supplied.  The data
            records are output as a series of hexadecimal  longword  values.   The
            qualifier is used to verify the tape structure.

  /FRT = file-spec

          - specifies the FRT file specification containing the normal FRT entries
            and  the  attribute  code  definitions (ACD) entries.  Any part of the
            file spec which is not supplied is taken from the default  definition:
            'LSL$FRT:CEDD.FRT'.

  /FULL_DIAGNOSTICS
  /NOFULL_DIAGNOSTICS (default)

          - selects  the  output  of  full  diagnostic  messages,  describing  the
            progress  of the CEDD to IFF file conversion.  This will probably take
            a long time.

  /LATITUDE = string

          - specifies that CEDD2I is to search for a dataset on the tape with  the
            required  latitude origin, or a dataset with the required latitude and
            longitude origin if the /LONGITUDE qualifier has also been  specified.
            The tape must have been mounted FOREIGN for the /LATITUDE qualifier to
            be operative.

            The latitude value is specified in the form DDMMSS.SSH where DD is the
            number of degrees, MM is the number of minutes, SS.SS is the number of
            seconds, and H is the hemisphere (either N or S).

            The /LATITUDE  qualifier  must  not  be  specified  with  the  /SELECT
            qualifier.

  /LONGITUDE = string

          - specifies that CEDD2I is to search for a dataset on the tape with  the
            required longitude origin, or a dataset with the required latitude and
            longitude origin if the /LATITUDE qualifier has also  been  specified.

            to be operative.

            The longitude value is specified in the form DDDMMSS.SSH where DDD  is
            the  number  of  degrees,  MM  is  the number of minutes, SS.SS is the
            number of seconds, and H is the hemisphere (either E or W).

            The /LONGITUDE qualifier  must  not  be  specified  with  the  /SELECT
            qualifier.

  /SELECT [ = integer (list) ]

          - if specified, the tape  is  searched  for  the  required  dataset,  or
            datasets.   The  tape  must  have been mounted FOREIGN for the /SELECT
            qualifier to be operative.

            The /SELECT qualifier has a number of options:


            /SELECT with no argument list will cause the program to  transfer  the
            next dataset on the tape, using the specified Output-IFF-file-spec for
            output.

            /SELECT = (integer list) will search for all the requested datasets by
            their  number on the tape (the tape will be REWOUND for the numbers to
            make sense), and, if more than one file  is  requested,  the  datasets
            will be transferred to a set of IFF files whose file-specs are derived
            from the specified Output-IFF-file-spec by adding the extension  _000n
            to  the  name  part of the file-spec (a maximum of 1024 numbers can be
            requested in  any  one  line).   The  default  output  file-spec  will
            therefore be 'LSL$IF:CEDD_0001.IFF' for the first file on tape.

            If no /SELECT is given, all the datasets remaining  on  tape  will  be
            copied to output file-specs derived in the same way as for the /SELECT
            = list option.


            It makes no sense to request /SELECT = 0.

            This qualifier must not be specified  with  either  the  /LATITUDE  or
            /LONGITUDE qualifiers.

  /REWIND
  /NOREWIND (default)

          - if present, the tape is rewound prior to reading.  Any dataset  search
            will  therefore  start  from  the  BOT.   By default no tape rewind is
            performed, and dataset search begins from the current tape position.

  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m


            [1mCommand[0m [1mline[0m

            The symbol CEDD2I is normally set up as:

                      CEDD2I == "$lsl$exe:cedd2i"

            and the program may then be used as if it were a normal VMS utility.

            [1mInput[0m [1mfile[0m

            If the input files are on magnetic  tape  on  a  standard  tape  drive
            without  a  ANSI  structure that would enable the tape to be read as a
            normal file with the usual VMS  commands,  then  the  tape  should  be
            mounted/FOREIGN, for example:

                      $ MOUNT/FOREIGN MSA0:

            The program may then be run with the  tape  device  specified  as  the
            input  file  spec,  which will be tested for FOREIGN mounting (and any
            filename ignored).  With FOREIGN mounting any search qualifiers may be
            used to retrieve the required dataset.


            If a valid ANSI structure has been imposed on  the  tape,  it  may  be
            mounted  not-FOREIGN and treated as a normal ANSI file obeying all the
            usual VMS utilities, and the file(s)  preferably  COPIED  to  disc  to
            facilitate  the  CEDD to IFF transfer.  In this case only one file may
            be converted at one time with CEDD2I, with its file name used  as  the
            normal input file-spec.  The file select mechanisms no longer apply.

            If for some reason the tape ANSI structure has become corrupted, or is
            in  compatible  with the operating system and CEDD2I fails to read the
            file, the tape should always be able to be read by mounting it FOREIGN
            and  the  program  will read it block by block extracting the relevant
            data.

            The input is expected to be valid  CEDD  data,  possibly  composed  of
            several  files.  If the tape structure is visible by mounting FOREIGN,
            there will a VOLume label at the start of the tape, and  each  dataset
            is  preceeded by header labels and tapemark, and terminated by another
            tapemark, any  EOF  trailers  and  then  a  single  tapemark,  or  two
            tapemarks  to signal the end of all data on the tape.  The actual data
            records within the tape markers consist of the DSI,  FEAture,  SEGment
            and  optional  TXT  text  records.  If mounted non-FOREIGN, it is only
            these last four block types that will be  visible  to  the  user,  all
            others  having  been  made  transparent  by  the operating sytem.  For
            further description of the CEDD data structure  see  the  accompanying
            FORMAT  chapter, or the International Hydrographic Organisation Format
            for the Exchange of Digital Hydrographic Data (November 1986).

            The default action is to output one dataset to a single IFF file,  the
            required  dataset having been selected by the appropriate command line
            qualifier(s), or input filename.  As many datasets as are required can
            be  output  by  suitable choice of command line qualifiers, if mounted
            FOREIGN, selecting by  file  number  on  tape,  or  latitude/longitude
            origin.

            [1mProgram[0m [1maction[0m

            After decoding  the  command  line,  and  opening  any  DUMP  file  if
            requested,  and  initialising the supplied FRT file, the program reads
            the CEDD data records in sequence.

            First the DSI record is read and any relevant information, if present,
            is used to create the IFF file header entries (RA, MD type 2, CP) that
            need this map specific data.  The file origin origin is converted into
            IFF  units and used for the MD2LOC origin offset, and the extents also
            converted, if present, are used for the RA range entry.  Two of  these
            entries  (RA,  CP) need the extent of the map which may not be present
            here and their address in the IFF file is stored for future reference.
            The  other IFF header entries are output at this stage as well (HI, MH
            (unset), NS, CC).

            Any information not transferable to these header entries is  put  into
            AC  entries  belonging to an enclosing area feature (feature code FC =
            1) that describes the whole map, as it is  known  at  this  stage,  in
            layer  0.   If the full coordinate extent information is not available
            at this stage, or has different values to those stated here by the end
            of  reading  the  entire dataset, the program will reposition to those
            entries (RA, CP) and update them, together with the coordinates of the
            enclosing feature in its ST entry, at the end of the program.

            Any subsequent Registration points and Accuracy regions  that  may  be
            present are also output to Layer 0 as point (FC = 2) and area (FC = 3)
            features respectively, with their values output to  the  feature's  AC
            entries.   If  the  CEDD  dataset  is  geographic,  the  latitude  and
            longitude coordinates converted into IFF units are  used  as  the  x,y
            coordinate   positions   for  the  registration  points,  and  if  not
            geographic the x,y (and z) registration values are used  for  the  x,y
            (z)  ST/ZS  coordinates.   All  the geographic and map coordinates are
            stored in the feature's AC entries, the latitude and  longitude  being
            converted  into  integer  hundredths  of seconds.  The x, y, z control
            points are converted into integer  IFF  units.   If  the  map  is  not
            geographic the accuracy region coordinates will be unreadable, and the

            The FEAture records come next, indexed  by  a  feature  Identification
            Number,  containing  all  the descriptive information on each feature,
            and a list of references to the coordinate segments belonging  to  it.
            As  each  feature  is  encountered,  a  new  feature  is  created in a
            temporary storage IFF file 'LSL$IF:TEMP.FEA' into which is output  the
            same IFF header entries as the main IFF file, followed by, in layer 2,
            any relevant feature information in AC entries necessary for the later

            recreation of the final IFF file features.

            The FSN field of the NF entry contains the number  of  segments  which
            belong  to  this  feature, and which wiil be read later in the SEGment
            records.

            Next the FS entry contains the feature FC (feature code) derived  from
            the  feature  type, at present defined simply as point, line, or area.
            Point features are stored with symbol string feature coding (FC  =  4)
            due  to  the  possibility  of storing many points in the same feature.
            Line features have FC = 5, and area features have FC = 6.

            All the per-feature information stored in the feature header blocks is
            output to AC entries for the feature (see the relevant FRT), including
            the all important FACS (Feature Attribute Coding  Scheme)  code.   Any
            FACS  attribute  field  values  are inserted into AC types (1100+field
            number), with the field number between 1 and 26.  Fields  of  width  2
            characters  are  treated  as integers, and those of width 3 characters
            are treated as real.  Value attribute fields are  put  into  AC  types
            (1200+field number), with the field number between 1 and 2 for feature
            headers with 4 blocks of 40 characters, and between 1 and 12  for  the
            maximum  6  block  feature  headers.   Text attributes are put into AC
            types (1300+field number), with the field number between 1 and  3  and
            the value field containing the length of the text string which is read
            into the AC text string field.

            These AC attribute entries when combined with the  FACS  code  can  be
            used to create any feature coding scheme to replace the basic one used
            in this program.

            Finally are created ST entries containing in the coordinate fields the
            Identification Numbers and Directions of all the segments belonging to
            this feature (the number of ST entries therefore being  equal  to  the
            number of segments stored in the FSN field of the NF entry).


            The following SEGment records contain all the  coordinate  information
            which   the   feature   records  are  expecting,  indexed  by  segment
            Identification Number, and referenced to the features  to  which  they
            belong.    Again   a   temporary   storage   IFF   file   is   created
            'LSL$IF:TEMP.SEG' into which is output all the coordinate  information
            as  proper  ST/ZS  entries,  the  number of which is stored in the FSN
            field of the NF entry.  The address of each NF entry in this IFF  file
            is  stored  in an array using the segment Identification Number as the
            array index in order to be able to locate the relevant segments later.


            These two temporary files are now merged into the final main IFF  file
            by  creating  in  layer  1  new feature (NF) entries, and then copying
            directly from the temporary files the FS and all AC entries  from  the
            .FEA  file, followed by all the ST/ZS entries from the .SEG file which
            belong to  the  feature,  (reversing  any  coordinate  strings  if  so
            specified  by  the  Segment Direction).  Any adjacent identical points
            are removed from coordinate strings going into the same feature, point
            coordinates  belonging  to  the  same feature are merged into the same
            ST/ZS entry up to the maximum number of 200, and then the final EF  is

            written.   This is done for each feature in the .FEA file, referencing
            by segment ID all the relevant segments in the .SEG file.

            When this merger is completed, it only remains to  reposition  to  any
            entries  in  the  IFF header dependant on the map extents that may not
            have been present at the DSI record, or may have been  incorrect,  and
            insert  the  correct  values.  These are the Range (RA), Corner Points
            (CP), and the coordinates of the first dummy area feature  in  its  ST
            entries so that it describes the whole of the map.

            There is an optional TXT record containing informational text relevant
            to  the  dataset  as  a whole.  This is copied to a file with the same
            name as the main IFF file with the .TXT extension.

            The  temporary  .FEA  and  .SEG   files   are   deleted   unless   the
            /(FULL_)DIAGNOSTICS  qualifier  is switched on for examination in case
            of program errors.

            The program produces messages giving information about the  files  and
            blocks   being  read  from  the  tape  or  disc,  and  any  errors  or
            difficulties   that   may   have    been    encountered.     If    the
            /(FULL_)DIAGNOSTICS  qualifier  is supplied, more detailed information
            on the transfer will be produced.  The /DUMP qualifier may be used  to
            produce a hexadecimal dump of the dataset records if the tape has been
            mounted FOREIGN.  This option allows the structure of the CEDD tape to
            be verified.

            The program  checks  that  the  CEDD  tape  corresponds  to  the  CEDD
            specification.   Any  discrepancies on the tape are reported, and will
            in most cases cause the program to abandon the  transfer  of  data  to
            disc.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
