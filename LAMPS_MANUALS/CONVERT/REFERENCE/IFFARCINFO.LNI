            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            RESTRICTIONS        - a summary of restrictions on the use of

            EXAMPLES            - annotated examples of utility useage.

            MESSAGES            - all classes of message are listed and described
                                  and suggested user action given. The messages
                                  are divided into sections according to message
                                  severity within which the messages are ordered
                                  alphabetically by message mnemonic.

            This section describes parts  of  the  EXPORT  files  created  by  the
            ARC/INFO  system  which  are  read  by  ARC2I and also some file parts
            created by the I2ARC utility.

            The EXPORT files being discussed are in uncompressed ASCII form  which
            is  not the standard representation.  By default, they are produced by
            the ARC/INFO system in compressed form which is unreadable.  This  can
            overridden  using  the  ARC/INFO  TAPEWRITE facility by specifying the
            compression argument as 'NONE' which should be the last thing  on  the
            line.   This  will  produce  an  ASCII file with the extension '.E00'.
            Continuation files (.E01, .E02 etc) can be produced  using  TAPEWRITE,
            but  these  are not supported and no attempt to process them should be
            made.

            The EXPORT format maintains three  basic  feature  structures,  namely
            linear  features, symbol features and text features, each having their
            own section in the EXPORT file  called  ARC,  LAB  and  TXT  (or  TX6)
            respectively.   In  addition  to  these,  there is another information
            section (IFO) containing information  relevant  to  the  whole  EXPORT
            file.   This  includes tables holding attribute information associated
            with features from the ARC and LAB sections.

            All features within the EXPORT file are referenced by an  internal  ID
            number  unique  within the dataset, and which are updated sequentially
            on reading the IFF file.

            An example EXPORT file can be found at the end of this  section  which
            contains examples of all the relevant sections.

            An EXPORT file will begin with a dataset 'header' of the form:

            EXP 0

            to be followed by feature  coordinate  information  grouped  into  the
            three  basic  feature  type  sections, each section having its own one
            line header of ARC 2, LAB 2, TXT 2, or TX6 2 designating the  relevant
            section.   These  headers,  with following value of 2, denote that the
            real coordinated within the file are of single precision  and  have  a
            field  size  of  14.   ARC2I will also process files containing double
            precision reals which will have header lines ARC 3, LAB 3, TXT  3  and
            TX6 3 and a field size of 24.

            All linear feature coordinates follow in the  ARC  section,  with  the
            format:


            ARC 2
                    I1          0        0         0         0        0        N1

             x             y

            for each feature in turn, consisting of an ID line and coordinates,

                    In         0         0         0         0        0        Nn
             x             y             x             y

            where I1, In etc.  are the internal ID numbers of the feature to which
            the subsequent coordinates belong, and N1, Nn etc.  are the numbers of
            coordinate x, y pairs to follow.  Only the x and y values  are  stored
            in  an  the  EXPORT  file,  and  no three dimensional z information is
            present.

            The maximum number of points for a feature is 500 and any  more  would
            have been carried over and a new feature created.

            The  x  and  y  coordinates  are   output   in   exponential   format:
            1.000000E+02.   The  end  of  all  sections  in  the  EXPORT  file are
            signified by the -1 ...  line, which  must  be  present  even  in  the
            absence of any x, y coordinates:

            ARC 2
                    -1         0         0         0         0        0        0


            The next section  of  an  EXPORT  file  contains  all  symbol  feature
            coordinate information in the LAB section, in the format:

            LAB 2
                     U1        I1 x             y
             x             y            x           y

            for each feature in turn, consisting of an ID line and coordinates,

                     Un        In x             y
             x             y            x           y
                    -1         0 0.0000000E+00 0.0000000E+00


            where U1, Un are the User-ID numbers and I1, In are  the  internal  ID
            numbers  of  the feature to which these coordinates belong.  After the
            LAB header, the coordinates for each symbol are  duplicated  twice  on
            the next line.

            The  x  and  y  coordinates  are   output   in   exponential   format:
            1.000000E+02.   In the absence of any symbol features, the EXPORT file
            must still contain:

            The third and last major coordinate section of an EXPORT file contains
            all  text  feature information in the TXT section in one of two forms.
            Below version 6.0 of ARC/INFO the text section has the format:

            where N is the level number to which the feature belonged,  S  is  the
            EXPORT  symbol  number  of  the  feature,  and  len  is  the number of
            characters in the text string.  Values x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4  and
            y4  may  not  all be present although x1 and y1 must.  They define the
            point, line,  arc,  or  spline  along  which  the  text  feature  lies
            depending  on  the  number  of  points  present.  Value sz is the text
            height and the others can be ignored.  The text string  is  output  in
            the 'text' line.

            The  x  and  y  coordinates  are   output   in   exponential   format:
            1.000000E+02.   In  the  absence of any text features, the EXPORT file

            ARC/INFO version 6.0 and above writes  EXPORTS  files  containing  the
            text  in  a  more  flexible  format.  This includes banked (composite)
            texts and splines containing many more points.   Text  attributes  are
            can  now  be  created  which  were  not available before this version.
            However,  these  attributes  are  not  currently  supported  and  text
            attributes in the TAT table will be ignored.

            The format of the version 6.0 text section is as follows:

            where N is the level number to which the feature belonged, npts is the
            number of points in the spline around which the text is bent, ncomp is
            the number of text components, S is the EXPORT symbol  number  of  the
            feature, and len is the number of characters in the text string.

            The range of values c1 to c(ncomp) denote the starting  point  in  the
            list  of  coordinates  which  follow  for  each text component and the
            values should not exceed npts.  The value ht is the text and the  text
            string is output in the 'text' line.

            In the absence of any  text  features,  the  EXPORT  file  must  still
            contain:

            After all this feature coordinate information must follow  information
            on  the  dataset  as  a  whole, in the IFO section, together with some
            formatting instructions.

            After the IFO section  header  line  there  will  be  several  tables,
            possibly in any order but usually alphabetical.  However, the simplest
            will be discussed first.  The  range  information  which  denotes  the
            maximum  and  minimum values of all data points within the EXPORT file
            is held in the .BND table.  This is as follows:

            where  xmin,  xmax,  ymin,  ymax  are  the  range  values  output   in
            exponential format.

            Next, the corner point values are held  in  the  .TIC  table  and  may
            contain  more  than  four  points.   In  this case, a polygon has been
            described which surrounds all data points within the EXPORT file.  The

            where x, y are the point values output in exponential format and N  is
            the number of points in the polygon.

            The next table, the .FSN, is not a recognised ARC/INFO  table  and  is
            only  produced  from  I2ARC.   The  .FSN  table  cross  references the
            internal EXPORT ID feature numbers to the  IFF  FSN,  FC  and  overlay
            numbers, in the format:

            where M is the maximum ID number in the dataset, ie.  the total number
            of  features.   Note  that  some IFF features will have been broken up

            into several EXPORT features with distinct ID numbers  (eg.   TS  text
            component strings).

            The .LUT table again is not a recognised ARC/INFO table and is produce
            by  I2ARC.   This  IFF feature code to EXPORT symbol number conversion
            table looks like:

            for each FC used in the IFF file.

            where N is the total number of FCs used in the IFF file.

            The next table to be described is the Arc Attribute Table (.AAT) which
            always  contains  at least 7 basic entries to describe the arcs in the
            ARC section.  This is a standard ARC/INFO table and  can  be  read  by
            ARC2I  using  the  parameter  file  mechanism  described  in  the next
            section.  The 7  lines  following  the  .AAT  line  should  always  be
            present.   Any  additional  attributes  are appended to the end of the
            table.

            this  is  the item field width, 'f', which is only used if 'i' is 2 or
            3.

            Here is a summary of the EXPORT item datatypes:

              Datatype   Width     Description

                 1         8       date held in 8 characters
                 2         f       character type. Width 'f' taken from table
                 3         f       integer. Width 'f' taken from table
                 4        14       floating point number stored in width of 14
                 5        11       binary integer stored in width of 11
                 6        14       floating point number stored in width of 14

            Following the .AAT table are the actual attribute data entries and are
            as  many as there are arcs in the ARC section.  The entries consist of
            the 7 basic attributes and any additional ones are appended one  after
            the  other  in  field  widths  described above.  An example of this is
            given at the end of the section.


            The next table to be described is a standard ARC/INFO table and is the
            Point/Polygon  Attribute Table (.PAT) which always contains at least 4
            basic attribute entries to describe the points in the LAB section.  If
            the  area and perimeter in the table are set to zero, then the .PAT is
            actually a point table, otherwise it is  a  polygon  table.   However,
            ARC2I  does not maintain any link/node structure and so any attributes
            in the .PAT are assigned to the LAB points irrespective of whether the
            table is really a point or polygon one.

            These 4 lines following the .PAT line should always be  present.   Any
            additional attributes are appended to the end of the table.

            where N is the number of additional attributes in the table itself and
            E  is the number of attribute entries following the table.  'i' is the
            item datatype value and lies in the range 1  to  6.   Associated  with
            this if the item field width, 'f' which is only used if 'i' is 2 or 3.

            This table is very similar to the .AAT table  and  the  datatypes  and
            field  widths  are  the  same.  However, the first entry following the
            .PAT table, typically contains a negative area and has an internal  ID
            number  of  zero.   This  entry refers to the world seed point for the
            whole map and can be ignored.

            It is important that the internal ID number held in the  .PAT  is  the
            same  as  the  internal  ID  number of the associated point in the LAB
            section in order for the attribute to be transferred.

            The example at the end of this section shows  typical  .AAT  and  .PAT
            tables and their following attribute entries.


            I2ARC uses a different mechanism to the .AAT and .PAT tables  to  hold
            attribute  information  this takes the form of 2 INFO tables, .IAC and
            .RAC, which are described below.  ARC2I can read  the  .AAT  and  .PAT
            tables  but  ignores  the  .FSN,  .LUT,  .IAC and .RAC tables that are
            produced by I2ARC.

            The .IAC holds the integer information extracted from any ACs  in  the
            IFF file, and takes the form:

            filename.IAC                         4   4  52         N
            filename-ID       4-1   14-1   5-1 50-1  -1  -1-1                 1
            TYPE              4-1   54-1   5-1 50-1  -1  -1-1                 2
            VALUE             4-1   94-1   5-1 50-1  -1  -1-1                 3

                    id         type        value "text"
                    id         type        value "text"

            for each integer AC in the dataset.


            where N is the total number of integer ACs in the IFF file.

            For each integer AC is given the feature ID followed by the  AC  type,
            its  value (which may represent a date, time or character as well as a
            normal integer) and any optional text given with the AC.

            In the absence of any integer ACs the EXPORT file must  still  contain
            an entry with no values:

            filename.IAC                         4   4  52         0
            filename-ID       4-1   14-1   5-1 50-1  -1  -1-1                 1
            TYPE              4-1   54-1   5-1 50-1  -1  -1-1                 2

            Now the real ACs are held in the .RAC as follows:

            filename.RAC                         4   4  52         N

                    id         type        value "text"

            for each real AC in the dataset.


            where N is the total number of real ACs in the IFF file.

            For each real AC is given the feature ID followed by the AC type,  its
            value and any optional text given with the AC.

            In the absence of any real ACs the EXPORT file must still  contain  an

            IFF is a feature orientated data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            The ARC/INFO format shares this concept of a 'feature'  but  does  not
            hold  all  information  relevant to a single feature in the same place
            within  the  dataset,  but  rather  separates  the  information   into
            different sections so that, for example, the coordinates of the points
            defining the feature are stored away from  any  attribute  information
            that  the  IFF  feature  might  have.  The contents of these different
            sections are indexed by  the  internal  EXPORT  ID  number,  which  is
            cross-referenced  to  the IFF feature serial numbers and feature codes
            in later tables.

            ARC/INFO has its own feature coding scheme whereby  the  FRT  file  is
            read  and  any  features unique in graphical type (GT), colour, width,
            size and secondary code are assigned a sequential symbol number unique
            within  the three major ARC/INFO feature types of linear (ARC), symbol
            (LAB) and text (TXT).  These are cross-referenced back to IFF  feature
            codes in later tables.

            It is essential that a feature  representation  table  (FRT)  file  be
            supplied  to  I2ARC  with  the  IFF file, as the graphical type of any
            feature is of prime importance in the  correct  placement  of  entries
            through the ARC/INFO file.

            When converting from IFF to ARC/INFO, it is not possible to  translate
            fully  some  IFF  graphical types, (the only features to be translated
            exactly are the linear feature with GT 1 consisting simply of a string
            of  coordinates,  and  the  text  feature  with  GT 10 consisting of a
            character string, size, orientation and position).  These  are  listed
            below, together with their approximations.

            All arc (true arcs, not to be mistaken with the ARC/INFO definition of
            an  arc)  and  circle  features (GTs 2, 3, 4, 5) in IFF are defined by
            three coordinates; edge-centre-edge or three edge points.  These  must
            be interpolated sufficiently to enable these features to be translated
            as simple linear features.

            Interpolated curves (GT 6)  are  considered  to  be  a  simple  linear
            feature.

            Symbol features (GTs 7, 8, 9) in IFF  may  have  size  or  orientation
            information  contained in the FRT file or in the IFF RO or TH entries,
            or  a  second  defining  point.   This  information  is  lost  in  the
            translation  to  ARC/INFO which can only consider a symbol as a simple
            entity.

            Symbol string features (GT 11) are  considered  to  be  simple  linear
            features, and the symbols defining the vertices are lost.

            Fill area features (GT 12)  are  considered  to  be  a  closed  linear
            feature, and any pattern fill information is lost.

            It is quite likely that IFF will be used as the digitising format  and
            the data subsequently transferred to an EXPORT database.  On the other
            hand, data may be transferred from  an  EXPORT  database  to  IFF  for
            complex  editing operations, or for other spatial processing functions
            such as structuring or polygon formation.

            Whatever the purpose for transferring data, the  relationship  between
            IFF  attributes  and  EXPORT attributes, if these are to be preserved,
            should be defined.

            The implementation of this requires

             o  a parameter file defining attribute correlation, and

             o  an FRT file (together with SRI and TRI files)  containing  an  ACD
                section

            The  parameter  file  defines  how  the  EXPORT  attributes  will   be
            represented  in  IFF  AC entries.  It is cross referenced with the ACD
            section in the FRT by name or code to get its datatype.   A  mechanism
            also exists to specify whether the attribute is to go into the AC text
            or value field.  If it is to go into the text field, the  datatype  in
            the  ACD  is  ignored.   If the datatype in the ACD conflicts with the
            datatype of the attribute in the EXPORT file, a warning will be  given
            and the attribute ignored.

            In converting from ARC2I, the attributes in any coverage tables  other
            than  the  .AAT  or  .PAT will be ignored.  Attributes in the .AAT and
            .PAT table will be ignored  unless  the  appropriate  definitions  are
            present in the parameter file.  When transferring attributes, the .AAT
            and .PAT attribute information should be in the same order as with the
            ARC and LAB sections respectively.  The ID numbers in the .PAT entries
            should match the ID number and order of the  corresponding  points  in
            the  LAB  section.   If  one  attribute  is  wrong  this may throw the
            ordering out and cause the following points to be given no attributes.

            When transferring data from EXPORT, ARC2I will only produce ST entries
            unless  the output revision level has been set to 1 within the system.
            Text features will contain TH entries holding the  text  height.   All
            features  will  have  the  text/symbol  bit in the FS entry set to the
            appropriate value to indicate the feature  type.   All  data  will  be

            The default feature codes are optional.   If  they  are  missing,  the
            default  feature  codes  are  1,  2 and 3 for lines, symbols, and text
            respectively.  These defaults can be  overridden  using  the  commands
            DEF_LINE, DEF_SYMBOL and DEF_TEXT in the parameter file to allow users
            to give these feature types the feature codes of their choice.

            Each line of the table is prefixed with a command which identifies the
            line  as  belonging  to that table.  The lines are free-format, so the
            order of entries matters, but the actual position of  entries  on  the
            line  is  not  important.  Any text starting with the "!" character is
            regarded as a comment, and is ignored.  Comments  can  appear  on  the

            be in upper or lower case.

            The attribute description table describes the translations required to
            produce  IFF attributes from EXPORT attributes.  Each line is prefixed
            with the ADT command which  tells  the  program  how  to  translate  a
            particular attribute.

                          either
                              VALUE which specifies that the AC value field is  to
                              be used, or
                              TEXT  which specifies that the AC text  field is  to

                          16 characters in length
                 [1mEtable [0m- a sub-command which denotes which EXPORT table the entry
                          is  referring  to  -  the  .AAT table or the .PAT table.
                          Logically, the valid commands are either
                              AAT which denotes this entry  as  referring  to  the
                              .AAT table, or
                              PAT which denotes this entry  as  referring  to  the
                              .PAT table

            The purpose of the 'Etable' column is because attributes of  the  same
            name  can  be  used  for  lines  as  for  symbols.  They may even have
            different datatypes.  In this case, two entries should be  given,  one
            with  this  field  having  command AAT and the other with command PAT.
            They should have different unique names  or  codes  to  reference  the
            datatype in the ACD section of the FRT.

            If a code is specified, it should reflect  the  ACD  table  which  the
            attribute  refers  to.   ACD table 1 entries range from 1000-1999, ACD
            table 2 entries range from 2000-2999 and so on.

            The annotation feature code table describes the  lookup  between  text
            LEVEL  and  SYMBOL  numbers  into  IFF  feature  codes.   Each line is
            prefixed with the ANNO command which tells the program that a line  is
            part  of this table.  A feature code can be assigned to a text feature
            on the basis of its LEVEL code, SYMBOL code or both.

            A line has one of the following three forms :-

                          code.  If the SYMBOL command is also given on this line,
                          then  the  feature code can only be assigned if both the
                          LEVEL and SYMBOL codes match.  If neither match  in  the
                          whole table, the default feature code is used.

                 [1mSYMBOL [0m- the SYMBOL sub-command denotes  that  the  feature  code
                          will  be  assigned  to  text features with the following
                          SYMBOL code.  If the LEVEL command  was  also  given  on
                          this line, then the feature code can only be assigned if
                          both the LEVEL and SYMBOL codes match.  If neither match

                                             NOTE

                    The order of entries in the ANNO table  is  important.
                    The  program  performs  a simple linear search through
                    the table to assign feature codes on the  basis  of  a
                    first  match  between  LEVEL and SYMBOL codes.  So if,
                    for example, you required an IFF feature code of  1001
                    to  be  assigned  to  features  which have an ARC/INFO
                    LEVEL code of 2 and SYMBOL code of 5,  but  a  feature
                    code  of  1002 to be assigned to features with a LEVEL
                    code of 2 irrespective of the SYMBOL  code,  then  the
                    feature  code  1001 must appear in the list first.  If
                    the feature code 1002 was put in the table first, this
                    would  match  everything  with  LEVEL  code  2  and no
                    features would be assigned feature code 1001.



            An example follows :-

  !
  !       FC      fcode   LEVEL  lcode    SYMBOL   scode
  !
  ANNO    FC      1000    LEVEL   1
  ANNO    FC      1001    LEVEL   2       SYMBOL  5
  ANNO    FC      1002    LEVEL   2
  ANNO    FC      1003    SYMBOL  3
  ANNO    FC      1003    SYMBOL  6
  ANNO    FC      1003    SYMBOL  7
  !

            The example also shows that the same feature code may be  assigned  on
            the basis of different LEVEL or SYMBOL codes.

                 [1mADT NAME   name   entry   field   Ename[0m

            where the fields are :-

                 [1mADT    [0m- the command ADT which states that this line is an  entry
                          in the attribute description table.
                 [1mCODE   [0m- the sub-command CODE which  states  that  the  attribute

                 [1mcode   [0m- the IFF attribute code, an integer in  the  range  0  to
                          32767,  as  derived from the appropriate ACD entry in an
                          FRT file.
                 [1mname   [0m- the IFF attribute name, as given by the appropriate  ACD
                          entry in an FRT file.
                 [1mentry  [0m- a command specifying which IFF entry the attribute is to
                          be transferred to - the only valid command is
                              AC which specifies that an AC entry is to be used
                 [1mfield  [0m- a  sub-command  to  AC,  specifying  which   field   the
                          attribute  is  to be transferred to - valid commands are
                          either
                              VALUE which specifies that the AC value field is  to
                              be used, or
                              TEXT  which specifies that the AC text  field is  to
                              be used
                 [1mEname  [0m- the EXPORT attribute name, a string which can be  up  to
                          16 characters in length

            The difference between this  and  the  ARC2I  parameter  file  is  the
            absence of the 'Etable' column because attributes of IFF line features
            automatically go into the .AAT table  and  attributes  of  IFF  symbol
            features go in the .PAT table.

            The AC entry and its sub-commands TEXT and  VALUE  were  included  for
            consistency  with  the ARC2I parameter file but are ignored.  This way
            I2ARC can use an ARC2I parameter  file  with  minimal  changes.   This
            entry is not used because I2ARC reads the ACD datatype from the FRT to
            determine which field to read the value from.  For example, if the ACD
            datatype  is  'C'  then the text is read from the optional text string
            and the integer and real fields are ignored.

            If a code is specified, it should reflect  the  ACD  table  which  the
            attribute  refers  to.   ACD table 1 entries range from 1000-1999, ACD
            table 2 entries range from 2000-2999 and so on.

  [1mPARAMETERS[0m

  input-IFF-file-spec

          - This parameter specifies the name of an IFF file, and  is  compulsory.
            The data written to the output file are read from this file.  Only one
            filename may be specified for each run of the program.
            The default device and extension LSL$IF:filename.IFF  are  applied  to
            the input file specification when it is parsed.

  output-ARC-name

          - This parameter specifies the name of an ARC/INFO data file  name,  and
            is  compulsory.   Only  the name of the output file must be specified,
            without any directory or extension attributes, and the output ARC/INFO
            file-spec  will  be constructed with the extension .E00 and written to
            the current directory.  The data read from  the  input  IFF  file  are
            written to this file.  Only one filename may be specified for each run
            of the program.  The maximum length for  the  output  filename  is  12
            characters  and  if  more  are  given,  it will be truncated.  This is
            because the name appears in the tables in the IFO section and  a  name
            with  more  than  12  characters  will  cause  the field columns to be
            misaligned.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mCOMMAND[0m [1mQUALIFIERS[0m


  /DEBUG
  /NODEBUG (default)

          - When /DEBUG is present,  the  I2ARC  utility  will  output  many  more
            diagnostic messages as it processes the input file than it would under
            normal running, or with the /LOG qualifier given.  Each IFF  entry  is
            signalled,  with  the  FSN  and  ISN given for the NF entries, and the
            number of coordinate points and their visibility  given  for  ST/ZS/CB
            entries,  as  an  aid  to tracing any IFF conversion problems.  If the
            program run should fail for some reason, all temporary files are  left
            for further examination to assess the cause of failure.


  /FRT=file-spec

          - The /FRT command qualifier specifies a  Feature  Representation  Table
            (FRT)  file  which  the  program  will read to determine the graphical
            types (GT) of the IFF features, and for information on any AC entries.
            The FRT qualifier with filespec is compulsory.
            The  default  file  specification  is  LSL$FRT:OS.FRT.   If   a   file
            specification  is  given  with /FRT qualifier, the file-spec is parsed
            against this default.


  /INFO_TABLES
  /NOINFO_TABLES (default)

          - When /INFO_TABLES is present,  the  I2ARC  utility  will  put  any  AC
            attribute  information  into ARC/INFO .AAT and .PAT tables rather than
            the .IAC and .RAC ones.  The .AAT and .PAT tables are the standard way
            of  holding attribute information within ARC/INFO and are described in
            the FORMAT DESCRIPTION section at the beginning of the chapter.
            If the qualifier is present, then /PARAMETER  must  also  be  used  to
            specify  a  file containing the attribute names as they will appear in
            the EXPORT tables.  If the qualifier is not present (or negated),  the
            parameter  file  is not required and any attributes are written in the
            form of the .IAC and .RAC tables.  This is the default action.


  /LOG
  /NOLOG (default)

          - When /LOG  is  present,  the  I2ARC  utility  will  output  diagnostic
            messages about any file creation or deletion as it processes the input
            IFF file so that any disc errors may be traced.

  /PARAMETER=file-spec

          - The /PARAMETER command qualifier  specifies  a  parameter  file  which
            holds  information about the translation of attributes into the output
            EXPORT file.  It is used in conjunction with /INFO_TABLES as  it  only
            describes  the  attributes  that  go into the .AAT and .PAT tables.  A
            description and an example of the parameter file can be found  in  the
            DATA PREPARATION section of this chapter.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mRESTRICTIONS[0m

            There are certain types of IFF feature that I2ARC does  not  translate
            fully.  These include:

            Arc and Circle features  (GTs  2,  3,  4,  5)  are  output  as  linear
            features,  with  interpolated  points between the start and end points
            used to define the feature.

            Interpolated curves (GT 6) and Symbol strings (GT 11)  are  output  as
            simple  linear features.  This means that the symbol information for a
            Symbol string is lost.

            Oriented or scaled symbols (GT 8, 9), which  I2ARC  treats  as  simple
            symbol features (GT 7), lose any size or rotation information supplied
            either in the FRT file or in the IFF file in TH or RO  entries,  or  a
            second size and orientation defining point.

            Area fill features (GT 12) are output as a closed linear feature.

            When using /INFO_TABLES, I2ARC can only produce EXPORT item  datatypes
            1, 2, 5 and 6 in the .AAT and .PAT tables.  This is because an integer
            ('I') datatype in the ACD part  of  the  FRT  could  map  onto  EXPORT
            datatypes  3  or 5.  Similarly, a real ('R') datatype in the ACD could
            map onto EXPORT types 4 or 6.

            I2ARC maintains no structure in the data  and  so  the  FNODE,  TNODE,
            LPOLY,  RPOLY,  AREA, LENGTH and PERIMETER values in the .AAT and .PAT
            tables are set to zero.

            The symbol I2ARC is normally set up as:

                      I2ARC == "$lsl$exe:i2arc"

            and the program may then be used as if it were a normal VMS utility.

  UTILITY I2ARC                                                   23 February 1993


  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mPROGRAM[0m [1mACTION[0m

            I2ARC is a utility to transfer an Internal Feature Format  (IFF)  disc
            file to an ARC/INFO export format ASCII disc file.

            Note that only a single dataset may be transferred during a single run
            of the program.

            For a full description of  the  ARC/INFO  output  file  structure  and
            format, see the Format section of this module's documentation.

            After decoding the command line for input and output  file  names  and
            the  qualifiers,  the  FRT  file  is  read.  Each feature code that is
            unique in graphical type, colour, width, size and  secondary  code  is
            assigned  a  unique  internal  Symbol code sequential within the three
            basic feature types:  Symbol (GT 7, 8, 9), Text (GT 10) or Linear (the
            remainder),  for  the  three  ARC/INFO  sections  of  ARC, LAB and TXT
            respectively.

            If it was specified on the command line, the parameter  file  is  then
            read to get the EXPORT attribute names associated with AC types.

            The supplied IFF file is opened with input revision level of  zero  so
            that  any  CB entries are translated into ST or ZS entries, from which
            only the x and y coordinates are read and used for the  ARC/INFO  data
            file.

            Because the ARC/INFO  format  stores  the  various  information  types
            separately  in  different  sections of the export file, temporary data
            files are created to store the IFF data as it  is  read.   These  are:
            $$LAB.TMP  for Symbol features, $$TXT.TMP for Text features, $$FSN.TMP
            for the FSN, FC, Overlay and internal ID number cross-reference table,
            $$IAC.TMP  for  integer  AC  information  and  $$RAC.TMP  for  real AC
            information.  If /INFO_TABLES was specified, any AC  information  will
            be  written  to  data files, $$AAT.TMP and $$PAT.TMP.  All these files
            are copied across to the main EXPORT file after the IFF file has  been
            read, and are then deleted.

            After writing the ARC/INFO file header of EXP 0 to the ARC/INFO  file,
            and the three coordinate section header lines of ARC 2 to the ARC/INFO
            file, LAB 2 to $$LAB.TMP and TXT 2 to $$TXT.TMP, I2ARC translates  the
            IFF  file  entry by entry into the relevant ARC/INFO file or temporary
            file.

            The IFF header entries of relevance to ARC/INFO are the range (RA) and
            corner  points  (CP)  are  stored for later use in the IFO information
            section's filename.BND table and filename.TIC tables respectively.

            Any overlay (NO)  entry  is  recorded  for  use  in  the  filename.FSN
            cross-reference  table  of  the IFO section, and for any text features
            encountered.

            On encountering a  new  feature  (NF),  the  serial  number  (FSN)  is
            recorded for the internal ARC/INFO ID to IFF FSN cross-reference table
            in  the  IFO  section,  as  also  is  the  feature  code  (FC).   This

            information  is  output to $$FSN.TMP at the end of feature (EF) entry,
            for later copying to the ARC/INFO file, as ID, FSN, FC  and  Layer  in
            the filename.FSN section in IFO.

            If /NOINFO_TABLES is given or missing, any information from  attribute
            code (AC) entries encountered is written to the $$IAC.TMP or $$RAC.TMP
            files depending on whether the AC value is integer  (or  character  or
            date  or  time)  or  real,  for  later  copying  to  the ARC/INFO file
            filename.IAC or filename.RAC section of IFO.

            If /INFO_TABLES is given, an initial pass of the IFF file is  made  to
            build a list of all the ACs in the file in order to create the tables.
            Due to the nature of the .AAT and .PAT tables, which hold an entry for
            each  attribute  of  each  line  or  symbol,  there may be some excess
            information.  The program has to produce a file containing the maximum
            number  of  attributes per feature for all features to cover the worst
            case.

            Any information in TX, TH or  RO  entries  is  stored  for  later  use
            depending  on  the graphical type of the feature:  for symbol features
            it is discarded, whereas for text features it may be used to calculate
            start  and  end positions of the text string when the coordinate entry
            has been encountered.

            What I2ARC does with coordinate information from any ST or ZS  entries
            (and CBs converted to ST/ZS) depends on the graphical type (GT) of the
            feature in its FC.  Linear feature coordinates can be  output  to  the
            ARC/INFO  file  immediately as they are the first of the three feature
            types (ARC, LAB, TXT) in the ARC/INFO format.  The IFF graphical types
            which  are  considered  to  be  linear  and  for  which the coordinate
            information is used without any change or interpolation are  line  (GT
            1),  interpolated curve (GT 6), symbol string (GT 11) where any symbol
            information is lost, and fill area (GT 12) considered to be  a  closed
            linear  feature.   All  arc  or  circle features (GTs 2, 3, 4, 5) have
            their three-point coordinate information interpolated into a  suitable
            number  of  points  to suitably define the feature, and then output to
            the ARC/INFO file ARC section.

            All IFF coordinate blocks  belonging  to  the  same  feature  with  no
            invisible line breaks are output to ARC/INFO in the one block, up to a
            maximum number of x, y pairs of 500, when a new block must be  started
            having  the  same  ID  number.  If the feature contains invisible line
            breaks, the sections are output to  ARC/INFO  in  separate  coordinate
            blocks with the same ID number.

            If the feature is a symbol (GTs 7, 8, 9) the coordinate information is
            output to $$LAB.TMP for later copying to the ARC/INFO file LAB section
            in the appropriate format.  ARC/INFO cannot handle any symbol size  or
            orientation  information that may have been held in the FRT file or TH
            or RO entries, or a second defining point, and this is discarded.

            All  text  feature  (GT  10)  coordinate  information  is  written  to
            $$TXT.TMP  in a suitable format for later copying to the ARC/INFO file
            TXT section.  The text status components (TS) of a  multi-text  string
            are  copied  separately as distinct features with distinct ID numbers.
            The text size in the FRT file, or  size  and  orientation  information

            end positions of the text string.

            Any other IFF entries are reflected to the user and ignored.

            On completion of the IFF reading, the end of section lines of  -1  ...
            are  written  to  the  three  coordinate  sections  in ARC/INFO (ARC),
            $$LAB.TMP (LAB) and $$TXT.TMP (TXT) and then $$LAB.TMP  and  $$TXT.TMP
            are copied to the ARC/INFO file and deleted.

            The IFO information sections are next completed.  First the header IFO
            2  followed  by  the range and corner point data into filename.BND and
            filename.TIC in suitable formats.  $$FSN.TMP  is  then  copied  across
            containing  the  ID,  FSN,  FC  and Layer reference table, followed by
            $$IAC.TMP for integer AC data and $$RAC.TMP for real AC data.  Finally
            the  filename.LUT  table  is  written  out  for the IFF FC to ARC/INFO
            symbol number reference, and the ARC/INFO file finished with  the  EOI
            and EOS terminators.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.

            ARC2I reads an uncompressed ARC/INFO EXPORT  tape  or  disk  file  and
            produces  a  Laser-Scan IFF file.  If EXPORT attributes are desired in
            the translation, a parameter file must be  specified  to  reflect  how
            they will be represented in the IFF file.  This parameter file is used
            in conjunction with the ACD part of an FRT file.

  input-EXPORT-file-spec

          - This parameter specifies the name of the input  EXPORT  file,  and  is
            compulsory.   The  data  written  to the output file is read from this
            file.  Only one filename may be specified each  time  the  program  is
            executed.

            The default device and extension 'SYS$DISK:filename.E00' is applied to
            the input file specification when it is parsed.

            When processing files on tape, the  input  file  name  should  be  the
            magnetic  tape  device  which  has  been  mounted  with /FOREIGN.  The
            EXAMPLES section shows tape files being processed.

  output-IFF-file-spec

          - This optional parameter specifies the name  of  the  output  IFF  file
            which  contains the data converted from the input EXPORT file.  If the
            parameter is not given, the output file will have the same name as the
            input    file    but   with   the   default   device   and   extension
            'LSL$IF:filename.IFF' applied where 'filename' is the input file name.

            When processing tape files, this parameter is only  permitted  if  the
            /SELECT qualifier was also given with one argument.  This file-spec is
            then given to the single tape file.  If /SELECT was missing  or  given
            with  more  than one argument, the output file-spec is ignored as each
            output file will have the coverage name held in each EXPORT file.

  [1mCOMMAND[0m [1mQUALIFIERS[0m


  /ARC_ID=keyword
  /ARC_ID=USER_ID (default)

          - This qualifier  specifies  which  fields  to  use  when  matching  arc
            attributes  to  their  features.   The  two  fields  available are the
            User-ID and the Internal-ID fields and so the keywords are USER_ID and
            INTERNAL_ID.

            The first field of each  line  feature  in  the  ARC  section  is  the
            Internal-ID  and  the  second  is  the User-ID.  Note that this is the
            opposite way around to the LAB section.

            The first seven default attributes in the Arc  Attribute  Table  (AAT)
            contain  two  ID  attributes, at least one of which should have values
            which reflect the User-ID or Internal-ID  of  the  ARC  section.   The
            attribute   called  the  coverage  name  followed  by  a  '#'  is  the
            Internal-ID (eg COVERAGE#) and the attribute called the coverage  name
            followed by '-ID' is the User-ID (eg COVERAGE-ID).

            The field that is used to match features must be unique and sorted  so
            that  each  entry  in  the  AAT table matches exactly the entry in the
            corresponding ARC section.

            If this qualifier is not given, the User-ID  field  will  be  used  to
            match any attributes to their features.


  /BLOCKSIZE=integer

          - This qualifier is used to specify the magnetic  tape  blocksize.   The
            blocksize  does  not have to be exactly divisible by the EXPORT format
            record size (80 characters).  The program  will  process  files  whose
            records  span  tape  blocks.   The  default block size is 8000 and the
            maximum is 65535.

  /FRT=file-spec

          - specifies a Feature Representation Table (FRT) file which the  program
            will  use to interpret the AC entries specified in the parameter file.
            In order for the program to do this, there must be an ACD  section  in
            the   FRT.    The   FRT   file-spec  is  parsed  against  the  default
            LSL$FRT:file-spec.FRT.  This qualifier must be used when the parameter
            file is given.


  /ID_TO_FC
  /NOID_TO_FC (default)

          - This  qualifier  is  specifically  for  use  with  data  supplied   by
            Bartholomews.   It  is  used to extract Feature Codes (FC) of features
            from their User-ID fields in the EXPORT file.   Since  IFF  will  only
            hold  a  maximum  FC  number  of 32767, the ID will be subject to some
            adjustments before being used as a feature  code.   These  adjustments
            area as follows:


               - User-IDs of zero are removed.
               - User-IDs which are less than 32768 are left unchanged.
               - User-IDs between 32768 and 139000 (inclusive) have their
                 first 3 digits removed.
               - User-IDs which are greater than 139000 will have their
                 first 2 digits removed.

            These adjustments will only  produce  unique  feature  codes  for  IDs
            greater  than  32768  if the EXPORT file contains a certain set of IDs
            that will not  conflict  with  others  when  they  have  their  digits
            removed.

            Use of this qualifier overrides the default FCs and the ones  held  in
            the  parameter  file.   It  only applies to linear and point features.
            Text feature will have the default feature code or that defined in the
            parameter file.

            Users of other ARC/INFO data may safely use this qualifier to  extract
            the  FC  from  the  User-ID  field  providing the values are less than
            32768.


  /LOG
  /NOLOG (default)

          - When /LOG  is  present,  the  ARC2I  utility  will  output  diagnostic
            messages about any file creation and what is happening as it processes
            the input EXPORT file so that any errors may be traced.


  /PARAMETER=file-spec

          - specifies the parameter file,  which  defines  the  transformation  of
            EXPORT attributes into IFF AC entries.  It is used in conjunction with
            the ACD section of the FRT file.  For a description of  the  parameter

            file, see the DATA PREPARATION section.


  /POINT_ID=keyword
  /POINT_ID=USER_ID (default)

          - This qualifier specifies which  fields  to  use  when  matching  point
            attributes  to  their  features.   The  two  fields  available are the
            User-ID and the Internal-ID fields and so the keywords are USER_ID and
            INTERNAL_ID.

            The first field of each point in the LAB section is  the  User-ID  and
            the  second is the Internal-ID number.  Note that this is the opposite
            way around to the ARC section.

            The first four default attributes in the Point Attribute  Table  (PAT)
            contain  two  ID  attributes, at least one of which should have values
            which reflect the User-ID or Internal-ID  of  the  LAB  section.   The
            attribute   called  the  coverage  name  followed  by  a  '#'  is  the
            Internal-ID (eg COVERAGE#) and the attribute called the coverage  name
            followed by '-ID' is the User-ID (eg COVERAGE-ID).

            Often the LAB section will have  unique  User-ID  values  for  polygon
            seeds  but  zeros  in  the  second  field (the Internal-ID) and so the
            /POINT_ID need not be given as this is the default.

            The field that is used to match features must be unique and sorted  so
            that  each  entry  in  the  PAT table matches exactly the entry in the
            corresponding LAB section.

            If this qualifier is not given, the User-ID  field  will  be  used  to
            match any attributes to their features.


  /REWIND (default)
  /NOREWIND

          - This qualifier defines whether the  magnetic  tape  device  is  to  be
            rewound  [1mBEFORE[0m  processing  begins.   When initialising the tape, the
            default is to ensure that the tape is at the beginning.  The /NOREWIND
            is  useful  when processing very large volumes of tape data that needs
            to be removed in sections so that the /SELECT values do not start from
            the beginning of the tape.


  /SCALE=integer

          - This is to specify the scale of the output IFF file which is  used  to
            update  the scale in the Map Descriptor (MD) entry and to convert text
            heights into hundredths of a millimetre on the sheet in the  IFF  (TH)
            entry.   If  no  /SCALE qualifier is given, the Map Descriptor is left
            blank and the text entries will have heights taken directly  from  the
            EXPORT file.

  /SELECT=(integer[,...])

          - used to select the files to be processed by their  position  on  tape.
            The  maximum number should not exceed the number of files on the tape.
            The /SELECT qualifier  will  accept  single,  multiple  or  ranges  of
            integer  arguments.   Ranges may be specified with starting and ending
            integers that are separated by a colon, for example /SELECT=2:4.  When
            specifying  more than one range they should be separated with a comma,
            for example /SELECT=(2:4,6,8:10).  The EXAMPLES section shows the  use
            of this qualifier.

            The arguments to /SELECT are relative the position of  the  tape  head
            which will depend on the use of the /REWIND qualifier.

            For example, to convert files from tape in groups of ten:

                 If  using  /NOREWIND,  the  program  should  be   invoked   using
                 /SELECT=(1:10) repeatedly because the tape head will remain after
                 each group of ten files.

                 If  using  /REWIND,  the  program   should   be   invoked   using
                 /SELECT=(1:10)  and  then  /SELECT=(11:20) and so on, because the
                 tape head will return to the start of the tape each  time.   This
                 will slow the process down as the program has to skip files until
                 it reaches the desire position.

                 If, however, it is required to start reading the  tape  from  say
                 the  51st  file  from  the  beginning,  to  reach  this point use
                 /SELECT=(51:60)   and    thereafter    (with    /NOREWIND)    use
                 /SELECT=(1:10).


  /VERBOSE
  /NOVERBOSE (default)

          - When /VERBOSE is present,  the  ARC2I  utility  will  output  detailed
            information about the ordering of the Internal-IDs of points and arcs.
            It is intended for use when attributes cannot be associated with their
            respective  arcs  or  points due the Internal-IDs being in a different
            order.  It should be noted that  the  program  only  makes  a  limited
            attempt  to  correct  the attribute ordering in the AAT and PAT tables
            and file should ideally contain unique, ordered Internal-IDs.

  [1m--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  [1mRESTRICTIONS[0m

            ARC2I  can  only  convert  EXPORT  files  that  are  created  with  no
            compression.  This implies that you can list the file on your terminal
            and read the strings of numbers which make up the arc and points  etc.
            The  ARC/INFO  TAPEWRITE  facility  will  produce  compressed files by
            default and this should be overridden by specifying 'NONE' as the last
            command on the line to disable the compression.

            ARC2I produces unstructured data with no polygonal information.   This
            can be achieved in IFF using IMP utilities ILINK and IPOLYGON.

            All attributes associated with line features must be held in the  .AAT
            coverage table in the IFO section and attributes associated with point
            features must be held in the .PAT table.  Attributes held in any other
            table are ignored.

            ARC2I does not handle unloaded text.  Any text within the EXPORT  file
            is  taken  from  the TXT (or TX6) section of the file and not from any
            updated text section in the  form  of  a  .TXT  table  under  the  IFO
            section.   It  is  therefore essential that the updated text is loaded
            back into the TXT section of the EXPORT file.

            If there are TXT entries in the EXPORT file with more  than  2  points
            defining  the  arc or spline along which a text feature lies, they are
            ignored.  ARC2I will only produce text features with no orientation or
            with an orientation equal to the angle between the origin and the line
            defined by the first two points in the feature.

            The program partially supports ARC/INFO version  6.0  annotation  text
            features  as held in the TX6 section.  The extent of the support is as
            follows:

               o  BANKED TEXT - IFF composite text features will be created if the
                  ARC   feature  has  the  relevant  information  defining  it  as
                  composite.

               o  ANGLED TEXT - Text with one point will have an orientation  (IFF
                  RO  entry)  of  zero.   Texts  with  two  points  will  have  an
                  orientation equal to the angle between the two points.

               o  BENT TEXT - Text digitised to follow an arc or curved feature is
                  not supported.  If the bent text consists of one component, then
                  its orientation will be defined as the angle between  the  first
                  and  last  points  of  the curve.  If the text contains multiple
                  components along one curve, each component will start on a point
                  of that curve.  Each component will therefore be oriented at the
                  angle defined by the first and last point for  each  component's
                  segment  of  the  curve.   The last point of a component's curve
                  segment is the point  before  the  one  which  starts  the  next
                  component.

               o  STRETCHED TEXT - Text features will not be stretched  in  anyway
                  to  fit  between points, be it by inserting additional spaces or
                  by  breaking  the  text  string  up  into  individual  component
                  characters.

               o  TEXT ATTRIBUTES - ARC/INFO Version 6.0 text  attributes  are  no
                  currently  supported.   Any  text attribute tables (TAT) will be
                  ignored.

            The EXPORT sections ARC, LAB and TXT (or TX6) are assumed to appear in
            this order in the file.  (ie alphabetical).

            Only single .E00 files can be  processed  as  ARC2I  does  not  handle
            continuation  files  (.E01,  .E02  etc).   Therefore  the  'max_lines'
            argument to the ARC/INFO EXPORT facility should not be invoked.

            The program only makes a limited attempt to correct any  discrepancies
            with the attribute ordering in the AAT and PAT tables and files should
            ideally contain unique, ordered Internal-IDs.

            The symbol ARC2I is normally set up as:

                      ARC2I == "$lsl$exe:arc2i"

            and the program may then be used as if it were a normal VMS utility.

            This file contains the attribute description table which describes the
            translations  required to produce IFF AC entries from EXPORT attribute
            data held in the .AAT and .PAT tables.  The format  of  the  table  is
            described in the DATA PREPARATION section under the heading 'The ARC2I
            parameter file', and it will probably have been set up  by  the  LAMPS
            system manager and remain relatively static at most installations.

            [1mProgram[0m [1mAction[0m

            After decoding the command line, the program creates a temporary  file
            which  consists of a copy of the IFO section of the EXPORT file.  This
            is used to process the ARC and  LAB  sections  in  parallel  with  IFO
            section  in  case attributes from tables such as the .AAT or .PAT need
            to be given to features.  This  temporary  file  will  have  the  name
            'filename.ARC2I_TMP' where 'filename' is the output filename.

            The IFF file is now created containing the  IFF  RAnge  (RA),  History
            (HI),  Map  Header  (MH), Map Descriptor (MD), New Section (NS), Cubic
            Coefficients (CC) and Corner Point (CP) entries.  The  CP  information
            being  those  values  in  the  .TIC table of the IFO section.  If this
            table contains more that four points, then a  maximum/minimum  box  is
            calculated for the area.

            The EXPORT ARC section is now processed to extract the arcs within the
            file and these are written to the IFF file with Graphical Type (GT) 1.
            The default feature code for these line features is FC  1  unless  the
            parameter  file  was  specified.   If so, the feature code will be the
            value associated with the DEF_LINE command.   If  the  .AAT  table  is
            present  and  contains  attributes  that  are correctly defined in the
            parameter file, then the linear feature will be given  the  associated
            attribute in the form of an IFF AC entry.

            Label points are now created using the information  held  in  the  LAB
            section  of  the EXPORT file.  These symbols have GT 8 and the feature
            code will be the default of FC 2 or the DEF_SYMBOL  in  the  parameter
            file if it was given.  Any associated attributes, correctly defined in
            the parameter file, will be taken from the .PAT and  assigned  to  the
            symbol  feature  as  an AC entry.  This will only be done if the label


  IFFARCINFO REFERENCE (1.4): ARC2I utility                               Page 4-8
  UTILITY ARC2I                                                   23 February 1993


            point ID number taken from the LAB section matches the label point  ID
            number in the .PAT entry.  It is therefore important that the order of
            the LAB entries matches that of the .PAT entries if the attributes are
            to be maintained in the translation.

            Any text features will now be extracted from the TXT  section  if  the
            file  was  created  from  an  ARC/INFO system before version 6.0.  The
            orientation of the text depends on the number of points specifying the
            line  along which it lies.  One point will result in an orientation of
            zero.  Two points will result in an orientation between the origin and
            the  line  created by these first two points.  Points in excess of two
            are ignored as ARC2I does not create text features that follow an  arc
            or spline.

            Files created by ARC/INFO version 6.0 or later  will  have  annotation
            extracted  from  the  TX6  section  of  the  file and appropriate text
            features created.  See the RESTRICTIONS  section  for  detail  of  the
            level of support for ARC/INFO version 6.0 text.

            Text features will be of GT 10 and can be assigned a feature  code  in
            one  of three ways.  If the LEVEL and SYMBOL codes of the text feature
            in ARC matches an entry in  the  parameter  file,  it  is  given  that
            features.   If this is not the case and the DEF_TEXT value was defined
            in the parameter file, it will be assigned this feature code.  Failing
            both these condition the default feature code of 3 is used.

            Finally the range (RA) entry information in the IFF file is updated to
            reflect  all  points  within  the  file  which  is  then  closed.  The
            temporary file is closed and deleted and providing no error  occurred,
            the user should never see this file.

            This examples shows that all the files on a magnetic  tape  have  been
            successfully  converted  to  IFF.  Since the /SELECT qualifier was not
            specified, all files on the tape have been processed  until  the  tape
            mark  was  found.   The  name  of each output IFF file was that of the
            coverage name held in each EXPORT  file  as  it  was  processed.   The
            absence  of  the  /LOG qualifier reduced the amount of information fed

            This example shows the result of processing a disk file with an output
            filename specified to prevent the the IFF file having the same name as
            the input file.  It also shows a warning message being  generated  due
            to a problem with an attribute called 'TYPE'.  This message means that
            the value of TYPE was held in the EXPORT  file  as  a  floating  point
            number  but had a conflicting datatype specified in the FRT.  Usually,
            if there is a problem with an attribute it will not be written to  the
            IFF  file  rather than writing a value that is incorrect.  The message
            can be ignored unless the attribute 'TYPE' is desired  in  the  output
            IFF  file  in  which  case the relevant action should be taken and the
            program run again.

      [1mExplanation:[0m  No attributes were assigned to the arc with the given internal

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An IFF or EXPORT attribute name cannot be read where  expected
      from the parameter file.  This message will be followed by an LSLLIB message
      indicating why the name could not be read.  The LINEINPAR message indicating

      [1mExplanation:[0m  No attributes were  assigned  to  the  point  with  the  given

  OUTFILIGNORE, output filename ignored when used with more than one tape file

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An output file specification was given on the command line for
      an  input file on tape.  This is permitted when /SELECT has one argument but
      any more and it is ignored and the name for the  output  file  will  be  the

      [1mExplanation:[0m  A text feature held in the EXPORT file contained more  than  2
      points  which  define  the curve along which it lies.  At present ARC2I only
      uses the first one or two points to give the text feature no orientation  or

      [1mExplanation:[0m  An attribute was found which has not been associated with  the
      .PAT  or .AAT table in which it appears in the EXPORT file.  This is done by
      having an entry in the parameter file for the attribute such that the  table

      If the attribute appears in both the  .AAT  and  the  .PAT  table  then  two
      entries  must  be  given.   They  may  be of different datatypes and this is

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
