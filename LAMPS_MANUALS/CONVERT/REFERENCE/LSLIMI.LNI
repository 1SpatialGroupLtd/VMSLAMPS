  [1mIntroduction[0m

            The LSLIMI translation menu allows the user to read data from magnetic
            tape or disk file into Informap, and to write from Informap to tape or
            file, the following formats:

             o  OSTF - the OS transfer format, sometimes also called DMC

             o  NTF  - the UK National Transfer Format  for  spatially  referenced
                data.   Currently,  level 1 is supported, and level 2 is partially
                supported, as specified in the current version of the  standard  -
                between versions 1.0 and 1.1.

            The menu system allows the user to specify  what  is  to  be  read  or
            written, and then runs the appropriate programs.

            LSLIMI is intended for a system running Informap.  It does not require
            a  Laser-Scan  LAMPS  environment,  and  if one is present, it is used
            independently of that environment.

            The only parts of LAMPS that are relevant are  the  following  modules
            from the CONVERT package:
             o  the  LSLIMI   module  -  LSLIMI_MENU.COM,  LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM,   an
                optional  menu  initialisation command file, and various parameter
                files
             o  the IFFIMAP module - I2IMAP.EXE and IMAP2I.EXE
             o  the IFFOSTF module - I2OSTF.EXE, OSTF2I.EXE and OSTFINDEX.EXE
             o  the IFFNTF  module - I2NTF.EXE and NTF2I.EXE

            The directories used by LSLIMI are all to be found in  STI_ROOT:[LSL].
            The following directories are used:

             o  STI_ROOT:[LSL.COM]
                This  directory  contains  the  command   files   LSLIMI_MENU.COM,
                LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM   and  an  optional  menu  initialisation  file.
                LSLIMI_MENU.COM is the menu system itself,  and  LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM
                sets up the environment required by the menu system.  The optional
                menu initialisation command file allows users to tailor the  menus
                for  a particular job.  LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM defines the logical name
                LSL$COM to point to this directory.

             o  STI_ROOT:[LSL.LOOKUP]
                This directory contains the translation parameter  files  used  by
                the  menu  system.   LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM  defines  the  logical name
                LSL$LOOKUP to point to this directory.

             o  STI_ROOT:[LSL.DATA]
                This is the directory in which OSTF and  NTF  files  are  read  or
                written,  when transfer is not to or from magnetic tape.  If files

                are to be read by the system, they must be in this directory, with
                extension  .OSTF  or .NTF respectively.  LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM defines
                the logical name LSL$DATA to point to this directory.

             o  STI_ROOT:[LSL.TEMP]
                This is the working directory  for  the  menu  system.   Temporary
                files  are  created  here,  and  then  deleted again.  LSLIMI_MENU
                defines the logical name LSL$IF to point to  this  directory.   If
                LSL$IF  previously  pointed  elsewhere,  it  will reset it when it
                exits.

             o  STI_ROOT:[LSL.EXE]
                This directory contains the images (.EXE files) of the translation
                programs  used  by the menu system.  LSLIMI_LSLINI.COM defines the
                logical name LSL$EXE to point to this directory.

            In general, the menus are  self-explanatory.   However,  it  is  worth
            explaining some things about their use.

            [1mSpecial[0m [1mcharacters[0m

            There are three special characters when using the menu system.   These
            are <CTRL/Z>, <CTRL/Y> and "?".

             o  <CTRL/Z> is used to move back a level.  It is only  meaningful  in
                response to a prompt.  If used in response to the

                          Choose the option you want:

                prompt, it will cause a return to the current menu's parent  menu,
                or  (in  the case of the TOP-LEVEL menu) exit the menu system.  At
                the bottom of each menu display there is always a line  specifying
                the action of <CTRL/Z> when used in this manner.

                If used in response to other prompts, <CTRL/Z>  is  treated  as  a
                reply of <CR>.

             o  <CTRL/C> is used to interrupt  the  current  operation.   If  used
                within  a  menu, it will cause a return to the TOP-LEVEL menu.  If
                used during input or output, it will terminate  the  transfer.   A
                line is always displayed specifying the action of <CTRL/C>.

            Each menu provides a list of options that may be selected.   The  user
            can  select  an  option  by  typing the option name in response to the
            "Choose the option you want" prompt.  For instance  in  the  NTF  main
            menu, the options are:

                  IN    - read NTF data into Informap
                  OUT   - write Informap data to NTF

            so the user could respond with either IN or OUT.  The  menu  does  not
            distinguish  the  case  of the answer, so upper and lower cases may be
            freely mixed.  Also, options may always be abbreviated to their  first
            two characters without fear of ambiguity.

            When deciding what to input or output, the user is  presented  with  a
            display  of  the  options relevant to the operation.  For each option,
            where applicable, the current  and  default  values  are  shown.   For
            instance,  figure  4  shows  the  initial  OSTF  input/output menu for
            OUTPUT.  The value associated with an option can  be  changed  in  two
            ways:

            1.  The user can select an option by name:

                          Choose the option you want: [1mDENSITY<CR>[0m
                          Density to write output tapes at:

                The user can then either reply with <CR>  to  accept  the  default
                value, or can specify the value required.

            2.  Alternatively, the user can specify the new value  for  an  option
                immediately:

                          Choose the option you want: [1mDENSITY[0m [1m800<CR>[0m

            In either case, if the value specified is acceptable, the menu will be
            drawn  again with the appropriate value inserted.  If the value is not
            acceptable, the user will be prompted for a correct value, as in  case
            (1).

            It should be noted that all values (with the exception of the Informap
            drawings selected for output) are global to the menu system - that is,
            once they have been selected, they are selected for all menus in which
            they  are applicable.  For instance, if the WHAT option is set to file
            input or output, then it will be so set in  all  of  the  input/output
            menus.

            When inputting data from OSTF, it is possible to select  which  sheets
            from the input dataset are required.

            If the OSTF data possesses a sheet index at its  start,  this  may  be
            inspected with the OSTF input menu SHOW option.  The SELECT option may
            then be used to specify a list of the sheets required, by their number
            in  the dataset.  This selection list is in the normal DEC VMS format.
            For instance,

                      1:3,5,7

            selects the first, second, third, fifth and seventh  sheets  from  the
            tape or file.

            When outputting data from Informap, the drawings to be output must  be
            specified.   This  is done using the DRAWING option in the appropriate
            menu.  More than one drawing may be selected:

            1.  The user can be prompted for the drawings required - the  list  is
                ended with a reply of <CR>:

                          Choose the option you want: [1mDRAWING<CR>[0m
                          First drawing to output: [1mSV1234NE<CR>[0m
                          Drawing 1 is SV1234NE
                           Next drawing to output: [1mSV1234SE<CR>[0m
                          Drawing 2 is SV1234SE
                           Next drawing to output: [1m<CR>[0m

            2.  Alternatively, drawings may be added to the list one at a time:

                          Choose the option you want: [1mDRAWING[0m [1mSV1234NW<CR>[0m
                          Drawing 3 is SV1234NW

            3.  The two methods may be intermingled - drawings will  be  added  to
                the list until the menu is exited with <CTRL/Z> or <CTRL/C>

            The number of drawings currently selected is  displayed  in  the  menu
            display.   To  see  the  names  of the drawings selected, use the SHOW
            option.

            1.  To ensure that the user has a chance to see the  contents  of  the
                screen, before it is replaced by a menu.  The three common example
                are when the SHOW option is used (to allow the  user  to  see  the
                result), after an input or output operation has completed (for the
                same reason), or after an error has occurred (to allow the user to
                see the error messages).

            2.  To allow the user to complete some operation before  allowing  the
                menu  system  to  continue.   The main example of this is when the
                user is requested to mount a magnetic tape - the process pauses to
                allow this to be done.

            Since all input and output translations use  the  temporary  directory
            STI_ROOT:[LSL.TEMP]  as  workspace,  only  one LSLIMI menu may perform
            translation at any one time.  To enforce this  restriction,  the  menu
            locks  the  directory  before  translation starts, and only unlocks it
            when it has deleted its working files from there.

            The  locking  is  accomplished  by  creating  a   text   file   called
            DIRECTORY_IS_IN_USE.ALREADY  in  the  temporary  directory.  If such a
            file exists, the menu will not proceed, but  instead  prints  out  the
            contents  of the file - this states who is using the directory and for
            what purpose - and returns to the input/output menu.

            default values used by the system (for  the  input/output  menus)  and
            whether an initialisation file is read.  If any changes are made, they
            should be recorded in the Modifications section at the  start  of  the
            file.   This  will  allow them to be reproduced in new releases of the
            menu command file.

            [1m----------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
            [1mDefault[0m [1mvalues[0m

            The default values used for the input/output menus are all defined  as
            local symbols at the start of LSLIMI_MENU.COM, in the section flagged
                      $! ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
                      $! INITIALISATION OF DEFAULTS

            Each symbol is of  the  form  IMAP$d_xxx  where  'xxx'  describes  the
            purpose  of  the  symbol.   It  is expected that each site may need to
            change some of the default values to match their own environment -  in
            particular, the following values:
             o  IMAP$d_drive  - the name of the default tape drive
             o  IMAP$d_schema - the name of the default Informap schema
             o  IMAP$i_params - the name of the translation parameter files.  Note
                that  this  is  an  [3minitial[0m  value,  not  a  default - the default
                parameter file name is always the same as the schema  name.   This
                value allows that assumption to be changed.

             o  IMAP$d_ntf_donor - the name of the site, to be used as the {DONOR}
                for NTF output.

            If the logical  name  LSL$IMENU_INITIALISE  is  defined,  then  LSLIMI
            assumes that it points to a command file which will pre-define some of
            the option values used in the  input/output  menus.   This  is  mainly
            useful  for debugging purposes, as normally the default values will be
            set correctly  for  menu  use.   Documentation  for  the  use  of  the
            initialisation file is to be found within the CHECK_INIFILE subroutine
            in LSLIMI_MENU.COM, and an example (LSLIMI_MENU_INI.COM)  is  supplied
            with the LSLIMI module.

  This menu can be used to change the width of the terminal screen in use, and  to
  select whether menus are to be displayed or not.  The latter option is preferred
  by some users -  the  banner  heading  for  each  menu,  and  any  prompts,  are
  displayed,  but  not  the  actual  menu itself.  The user can always use the "?"
  response to show the current menu.
