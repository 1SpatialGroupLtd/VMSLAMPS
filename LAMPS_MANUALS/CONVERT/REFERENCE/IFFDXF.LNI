            This manual is intended  for  users  of  a  specific  utility  of  the
            Laser-Scan CONVERT package running under the VAX/VMS operating system.
            Each manual  contains  the  documentation  for  a  particular  CONVERT
            utility  and a site will only receive new or updated documentation for
            those utilities which they have purchased.

            This document is composed of 2 major sections.

            The Introduction is  an  overview  of  the  CONVERT  package  and  its
            purpose.

            There then follow the User Guides for  the  individual  modules  which
            comprise  CONVERT.   Each  individual  module  contains the same basic
            categories of information.  These are:

            MODULE              - the name of the CONVERT module.

            FORMAT DESCRIPTION  - a description of the data format written or
                                  read by the utility programs in this conversion
                                  module.

            DATA PREPARATION    - guidance on how to digitise or prepare the IFF
                                  and other data required by the utility programs
                                  in this module.

            For each utility program  in  the  module,  there  will  then  be  the
            following categories:

            UTILITY             - the name of the utility.

            FUNCTION            - a synopsis of what the utility does.

            FORMAT              - a summary of the utility command format
                                  and command qualifiers. Default qualifier
                                  settings are indicated.

            PROMPT              - how it prompts the user.

            PARAMETERS          - description of expected command parameters.

            COMMAND QUALIFIERS  - description of all command qualifiers.
                                  Qualifiers are ordered alphabetically and 
                                  default argument values are indicated.

            The Digital eXchange Format (DXF) is the format  produced  by  several
            CAD  packages,  including  Auto-CAD  and  ZMAP.   DXF  is  produced by
            Auto-CAD program DXFOUT and is read back in by Auto-CAD program DXFIN.
            For  a  brief  comparison  of the way IFF and DXF regard data, see the
            section on COMPARISON OF DXF AND IFF below.

            The format produced is an ASCII  text  format,  as  described  in  the
            Auto-CAD Release 10 Reference Manual, Appendix C.

            There are four sections in a DXF files:  HEADER,  TABLES,  BLOCKS  and
            ENTITIES.   A file consists of a series of groups, each of which has a
            code and a value.

            [1mHEADER[0m [1msection[0m

            The HEADER section contains various settings of  variables  associated
            with the drawing.  Several variables from this section are used in the
            conversion to and from IFF.  They include $EXTMIN,  $EXTMAX  (to  give
            the IFF range), $CECOLOR giving the colour derivation; whether BYLAYER
            (or BYBLOCK, not supported), $CELTYPE giving  the  default  line  type
            derivation, or BYLAYER or BYBLOCK (not supported), $TEXTSTYLE (default
            text style), $TESTSIZE (default  text  height)  and  $CLAYER  (default
            layer  name).   If the entities are to be coloured by layer, the value
            of $CECOLOR will be set to 256.  A value of zero signifies  colour  by
            block (not supported).

            [1mTABLES[0m [1msection[0m

            The TABLES section contains three supported tables:  LTYPE, LAYER  and
            STYLE.   They  define various basic characteristics of the drawing and
            are referenced by the ENTITIES section (see ENTITIES section).

                  o  The LAYER table defines a set of transparent areas where  the
                     entities  logically  lie.   The  only items supported are the
                     layer name (2 group), layer line type (6 group) and the layer
                     colour index (62 group).  The layer colour index or line type
                     items will only be used when the entities in the drawing  are
                     to  be grouped by layer (that is, when $CECOLOR in the HEADER
                     section is set to 256,  or  $CELTYPE  is  BYLAYER).   If  the
                     entities  are  to  be grouped by layer, the colour entries or
                     line types encountered in the LAYER table will override those
                     defined  in  individual  entities  in  the  ENTITIES section.
                     Users should note that all entities in the  ENTITIES  section
                     must  reference  a  valid  layer  defined in the LAYER table,
                     either given explicitly, or the default from $CLAYER.

                  o  The LTYPE table defines the linetypes  to  be  used  for  DXF
                     linear  entities.   The  only  item supported is the linetype
                     name (2 group).

                  o  The STYLE table defines the text style of DXF text  entities.
                     The only item supported is the text style name (2 group).

            [1mBLOCKS[0m [1msection[0m

            The BLOCKS section contains all the block definitions.   A  block,  in
            DXF terms, is defined as a group of graphical entities which represent
            a symbol definition in the IFF context.  A block is referenced by  the
            INSERT  entities  in  the  ENTITIES section.  Normally, only the block
            name  entry  (2  group)  is  supported  and  treated   as   a   symbol
            representation  of the block.  However, if there is an EXPAND entry in
            the parameter file, the constituent elements of the BLOCK (symbol) are

            output  to IFF with DXF2I, modifying the internal coordinates with the
            offsets and scalings given in  the  parameter  file  representing  the
            final INSERTion point and scale.  There is no reverse translation from
            IFF to DXF BLOCKS.

            [1mENTITIES[0m [1msection[0m

            The ENTITIES section contains all the graphical data in  the  drawing.
            The  entity  types  supported  are:   LINE, POINT, CIRCLE, ARC, TRACE,
            SOLID, TEXT, INSERT,  POLYLINE  and  VERTEX.   The  entity  types  not
            currently  supported  are:   SHAPE,  ATTDEF  and ATTRIB.  Entities are
            defined by a series of group values which indicate the type  of  value
            they represent, followed by the actual value.  Each entity begins with
            a 0 group identifying the entity type.  Every  entity  contains  an  8
            group  which  gives the name of the layer in which the entity resides.
            A 6 group gives the linetype name (if not by layer).   Note  that  the
            layer  names  and  linetype  names  are defined in the LAYER table and
            LTYPE table of the TABLES section respectively.  The default  linetype
            name  is  'CONTINUOUS', and default text style 'STANDARD'.  A 62 group
            gives the colour index number (if not by layer).  It  is  to  be  used
            only  when the entities are not grouped by layer, otherwise the colour
            index number defined in the LAYER table of the TABLES section will  be
            used instead.

            The following  groups  may  be  included  in  any  entity  if  it  has
            non-default values for the properties:

                           6      LINE TYPE NAME
                          38      ELEVATION
                          39      THICKNESS
                          62      COLOUR NUMBER


            The rest of the groups that make up an entity depend upon  the  entity
            type.  These are:

            LINE      10, 20 and 30 (start point coords), 11, 21 and 31 (end point
                      coords).   Line  features in DXF are restricted to two point
                      segments.   More  complex  lines  are  defined  by  POLYLINE
                      features (see below).

            POINT     10, 20 and 30 (x, y and z coordinates)

            CIRCLE    10, 20 and 30 (centre) and 40 (radius)

            ARC       10, 20 and 30 (centre), 40 (radius), 50 (start angle) and 51
                      (end angle)

            TRACE     four points defining the corners of the trace:  10,  20  and
                      30; 11, 21 and 31; 12, 22 and 32; 13, 23 and 33

            SOLID     as for TRACE.  If only three points were entered, the  third
                      and fourth points will be the same.

            IFF is a feature  oriented  data  format  -  data  is  separated  into
            features,  and  each  feature  represents  one 'thing' on the map.  An
            integer feature code is used to say what type of thing it is that  the
            feature represents.  A feature might thus be a contour, or a house, or
            a river, depending on the type of map being  digitised,  and  the  way
            that the data is to be used.

            DXF format shares this concept of a 'feature', but  the  features  are
            not  uniquely  feature  coded.   Each  individual  feature  has coding
            relating to its graphical appearance only  such  as  colour  and  line
            type.  Control over these parameters may be exercised individually for
            each entity or by  defining  overall  values  for  each  layer  -  the
            features  are notionally coded by grouping similar features in a layer
            which has a name describing its contents.

            The method of coding to be applied is determined by the setting of the
            $CECOLOR variable in the HEADER section.  If the value of the variable
            is set to 256, all the entities of the drawing will be grouped by  the
            layer  they  reside  in and will appear with the colour defined in the
            LAYER table of the TABLES section.  If the value is set to 0, all  the
            entities  will  be  grouped  by  block  (note  that this option is not
            supported).

            In order to facilitate a flexible transfer of data between IFF and DXF
            formats, lookup tables are used.  These determine how IFF features are
            translated into DXF entities and vice versa.  It will be  possible  to
            use   the  same  lookup  table  for  both  programs  if  a  one-to-one
            translation is maintained.

            It is also  possible  to  use  the  same  lookup  table  to  define  a
            conversion between DXF text height (in mms.) and point sizes.

            The parameter file contains two lookup tables :-

            a)  the layer description table
            b)  the entity description table
            c)  the text size description table

            Each line of a particular table  is  prefixed  with  a  command  which
            identifies  the  line  as  belonging  to  that  table.   The lines are
            free-format, so the order of entries matters, but the actual  position
            of  entries on the line is not important.  Commands may be in upper or
            lower case.

            A maximum of 10000 entries will be allowed per parameter file.

            Any text starting with the "!" character is regarded as a comment, and
            is  ignored.  Comments can appear on the same lines as commands, or on
            separate lines.

            The layer description table defines the mapping between DXF layers and
            IFF  layers.   The  DXF  layer  is  identified  by  a character string
            representing the layer name while the IFF layer  is  identified  by  a
            unique integer.  Each line is prefixed with the LAYER command.

            A line has the following form:-

                 [1mLAYER   name   number[0m

            where the fields are:-

                 [1mname   [0m- the DXF layer name, a character string,  as  defined  in
                          the LAYER table of the TABLES section in the DXF file.
                 [1mnumber [0m- the IFF layer number, an integer, as defined in the  IFF
                          file.

            The character string format does  not  allow  the  use  of  the  space
            character and is case sensitive.

            The entity description table describes the  translations  required  to
            produce  DXF  entities  from IFF features or vice versa.  Each line is
            prefixed with the ENTITY command,  which  has  one  of  the  secondary
            commands  illustrated below.  The secondary commands correspond to DXF
            entity types, except for the EXPAND secondary command, which signifies
            that  any entities constituting a BLOCK (symbol) in the BLOCKS section
            of the DXF file should be output  to  IFF  using  the  current  entity
            conversions  present.   This  expansion will use the specified offsets
            and scalings to alter the internal symbol coordinates to get the world
            coordinates  (using  x_new  =  Xscale*x  +  Xoff).   These offsets and
            scalings will be in the final INSERT for the symbol, unless there is a
            hierarchy  of  BLOCKS  within  BLOCKS  each  with  different scalings/
            offsets, in which case the final scaling and offset must be calculated
            and  used  in  the parameter file.  This EXPAND entry is only used for
            DXF2I, as there is no mechanism to reconstruct a BLOCK structure  from
            IFF.

            A line has one of the following forms :-

            All numerical entries must be non-negative, (except  for  the  colour,
            group  62 entry, which can use negative values) and all fields must be
            present.

            There is no individual entry field for VERTEX as VERTEX is  considered
            as part of the definition of POLYLINE.

            Text heights will be read from/written  to  IFF  TH  entries,  (ENABLE
            HEIGHT will be required in LITES2).  DXF uses mms.  in the text height
            fields, whereas IFF TH entries may represent mms./100, or point sizes,
            and  the  translation to use is set by a /POINT_SIZE qualifier in both
            programs DXF2I or I2DXF.

            If the point size option is enabled in  either  program,  there  is  a
            facility  to translate between mms.  and point sizes.  The ENTITY TEXT
            line may  have  an  optional  font  number  assigned  to  the  FC/text
            style/colour  combination.   This  font  number must lie between 1 and
            100, and refers to the font number used in the TEXT SIZE entries which
            set  up  assignments  between mms.  and point sizes for each font.  If
            the font exists on the entity line, the TEXT SIZE entries are read and
            used, otherwise some program defaults are used.

            The following reserved names must be specified in the  parameter  file
            when  converting  from DXF to IFF format, if their relevant fields are
            not explicitly specified in the DXF file:

                  o  LTYPE 'CONTINUOUS' for all DXF linear entities, LINE, CIRCLE,
                     ARC, TRACE, SOLID and POLYLINE.

                  o  STYLE 'STANDARD' for DXF TEXT entities.

            Note that upper case should be used  for  these  values  in  order  to
            denote their default nature (i.e.  'CONTINUOUS' and 'STANDARD').

            There are nine default line types supplied by I2DXF.  They are:

                  o  'CONTINUOUS' _________________________

                  o  'DASHED'     __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ _

                  o  'HIDDEN'     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

                  o  'CENTRE'     ____ _ ____ _ ____ _ ____

                  o  'PHANTOM'    _____ _ _ _____ _ _ _____

                  o  'DOT'        .........................

                  o  'DASHDOT'    __ . __ . __ . __ . __ . 

                  o  'BORDER'     __ __ . __ __ . __ __ . _

                  o  'DIVIDE'     __ . . __ . . __ . . __ .

            There are also three default text styles supplied by I2DXF.  They are:

                  o  'STANDARD'

                  o  'ROMANC'

                  o  'ROMANT'

            For users who wish to output a line type other than the nine  provided
            by I2DXF (see above), they can do so by specifying their user-specific
            line type in the appropriate column of the parameter  file.   However,
            as  the  graphical  representation for this user-specific line type is
            not supported by I2DXF, the graphical representation  of  the  default
            line  type  CONTINUOUS  is  used  instead.  Any DXF entities with this
            user-specific line type are  therefore  graphically  indistinguishable
            from  those  entities  with  CONTINUOUS  line  type.   Users  who  are
            interested in customising their line types are  advised  to  refer  to
            Section B5 of the AutoCad Reference Manual.

            Similarly, any DXF text entities with text style other than the  three
            provided  by  I2DXF (see above) are graphically indistinguishable from
            those entities with STANDARD text style.  Users who are interested  in
            customising  their  text  styles are advised to refer to Section B7 of
            the AutoCad Reference Manual.

            The text size description table defines the mapping between  DXF  text
            heights  (in  mms.)  and  point  sizes.   It  requires the /POINT_SIZE
            qualifier to be used, so that any IFF TH entries  are  interpreted  as
            points, instead of mms./100.

            A line has the following form:-

                 [1mTEXT[0m [1mSIZE   font_number   point_size   mm_size[0m

            where the fields are:-

                 [1mfont_number   [0m- the font number, a  number  between  1  and  100,
                          representing   the   particular  font  assigned  to  the
                          particular  FC/text  style/colour  combination  in   the
                          ENTITY TEXT line.
                 [1mpoint_size [0m- the IFF point size number, an integer between 1  and
                          100, used in the IFF TH entry.
                 [1mmm_size [0m- the DXF mm.  size , a real number used in the DXF  text
                          height entry.

            All numerical entries must be positive and in their stated ranges, and
            all   fields   must  be  present.   Any  mm.   text  heights  will  be
            interpolated to the nearest point value given in the table.   If  none
            exists,  the  last  mm.   size  read  is  used  as  a default, with an
            appropriate message given.

            An example use of these fields is given below:

            The mapping between DXF entities and IFF features is restricted by the
            nature  of  the  DXF  entity  types and their associated IFF graphical
            types.

            It is possible to define a  many-to-one  mapping  for  the  conversion
            between  some  IFF  graphical  types  and DXF entity types, i.e.  when
            converting from  IFF  to  DXF  format,  allowing  more  than  one  IFF
            graphical  type  to  map  onto  only  one  DXF  entity  type, and when
            converting from DXF to IFF format, allowing more than one  DXF  entity
            type to map onto only one IFF graphical type.

            For example, when converting from IFF to DXF format, an IFF UNORIENTED
            SYMBOL  feature can either map onto a DXF POINT entity or a DXF INSERT
            entity.  However, when converting in  the  reverse  direction,  a  DXF
            POINT entity can only map onto an IFF UNORIENTED SYMBOL feature.

            The following is the summary of  the  mapping  restrictions  from  IFF
            graphical types to DXF entity types:-

                                                    FILL AREA (12)

            It is also possible to define a many-to-one mapping for the conversion
            between the IFF features and DXF entities of the same type, i.e.  when
            converting from IFF to DXF format, allowing more than one IFF  feature
            code  to map onto only one DXF entity, and when converting from DXF to
            IFF format, allowing more than one DXF entity to map onto only one IFF
            feature code.

            For example, given the following ENTITY lookup table :-

                     [1mENTITY   DXF_type   line_type             Colour   FC[0m

                     [1mENTITY   POLYLINE   DASHED                3        20[0m
                     [1mENTITY   POLYLINE   DASHED                3        21[0m

            If feature code(FC) 20 and feature code (FC) 21  both  represent  fill
            areas  (IFF  graphical type 12), the conversion from IFF to DXF format
            is unambiguous since they bear  a  many-to-one  mapping  relationship,
            i.e.   more  than  one  IFF  feature  code is mapped onto only one DXF
            entity.  The only resulting DXF entity is  POLYLINE  bearing  linetype
            'DASHED' and a colour index of 3.

            The use of this many-to-one mapping method does allow a certain degree
            of flexibility but it is not without a problem.  In the above example,
            problems will occur if we try to convert data from DXF format back  to
            IFF  format  using  the  same  parameter file.  Since the two POLYLINE
            entities have the same characteristics, i.e.   linetype  'DASHED'  and
            colour  index  3,  the  program  will not be able to uniquely identify
            their corresponding feature code entries.  When  ambiguities  of  this

            In summary, when converting from IFF to DXF format, the  feature  code
            (FC)  entry  should  be  unique, otherwise the first of the duplicated
            feature codes will be used.  Similarly, when converting  from  DXF  to
            IFF  format,  the  entities'  characteristics  combination,  i.e.  DXF
            entity type, DXF entity name  (depends  on  entity  type)  and  colour
            should   be  unique,  otherwise  only  the  first  of  the  duplicated
            combinations will be used.

            There is no distinction in IFF format between line features with  only
            two points and those with more than two.  In DXF format, line entities
            with only two data points are stored as LINE while those entities with
            more than two data points are stored as POLYLINE.  Problems will occur
            when converting from IFF to DXF format since the IFF feature  code(FC)
            entries  in the parameter file should be unique, i.e.  the user cannot
            specify both DXF LINE and POLYLINE  entity  types  for  the  same  IFF
            feature code.

            As a result of this, for I2DXF, the following rules then apply :-

                  o  If the input IFF feature has only two data points, I2DXF will
                     convert  the feature into DXF LINE format provided the entity
                     type specified by the user in the parameter  file  is  either
                     LINE or POLYLINE.

                  o  If the input IFF feature has more than two data points, I2DXF
                     will  convert it into DXF POLYLINE format provided the entity
                     type specified by the user in the PARAMETER  file  is  either
                     LINE or POLYLINE.

            For example, given an IFF file with only two linear  features,  FSN  1
            with  only two data points and FSN 2 with three data points (both with
            feature code 30), and the following parameter file:

                     [1mENTITY   LINE       DASHED                3        30[0m

            When converting from IFF to DXF format, I2DXF will convert FSN 1  into
            DXF LINE and FSN 2 into DXF POLYLINE.

            Problems will occur when converting the  so-generated  DXF  file  back
            into  IFF  format  using  the  same  parameter  file.   Errors will be
            encountered since the DXF POLYLINE entity type is not specified in the
            original  parameter  file.   To  account  for  the DXF POLYLINE, a new
            command line has to be added to  the  parameter  file  to  define  the
            mapping  between  DXF  POLYLINE and IFF feature code (FC) 30.  The new
            parameter file will be in the following form:

                     [1mENTITY   LINE       DASHED                3        30[0m
                     [1mENTITY   POLYLINE   DASHED                3        30[0m

            Users are  advised  to  design  the  mapping  in  the  parameter  file
            carefully  if  the parameter file is to be used in both directions and
            the integrity of the data is to be preserved.

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.

            I2DXF is  a  Laser-scan  IFF  format  to  Auto-CAD  DXF  ASCII  format
            converter.   It reads from a standard IFF file and produces a standard
            DXF text file.  Output is directed to disk file.

  [1mCOMMAND[0m [1mQUALIFIERS[0m

  /[NO]ABSOLUTE

          - enables the output of absolute coordinates to DXF.  The default action
            is to output the local IFF coordinates.  Error messages will be output
            if the MD entry is missing, or does not contain  a  local  origin,  if
            this qualifier is given.

  /[NO]DECIMAL_PLACES
  /DECIMAL_PLACES = integer

          - enables the user to specify the number of decimal places output in the
            x,y  coordinates.   This  may be useful for the output to DXF from IFF
            files which contain coordinates  of  small  absolute  magnitude  where
            resolution  is to be preserved.  The supplied number should be between
            1 and 9.  If this qualifier is not given, the default output format is
            with 3 decimal places.

  /FRT = file-spec

          - causes an FRT file, containing definitions of feature codes to be read
            in.  These definitions will then be used to identify the features read
            in the IFF file.  The default is LSL$FRT:DXF.FRT.  This  qualifier  is
            mandatory.

  /[NO]HEADER

          - enables the text fields of type 6 AC's attached to  the  area  feature
            (FSN  1,  FC  0  in  LAYER  0) to be read and used for some of the DXF
            HEADER variables.

  /[NO]LOG

          - enables a range of informational messages concerning the  progress  of
            the data translation to be displayed on the terminal.

  /PARAMETER = file-spec

          - specifies the parameter  file  which  defines  the  transformation  of
            feature  codes  in the IFF data to entity types in DXF.  The parameter
            file-spec is parsed from the default LSL$LOOKUP:DXF.PAR.  Any part  of
            the  file name which is not specified by the /PARAMETER qualifier will
            be taken from the above  default  specification.   This  qualifier  is
            mandatory.

  /[NO]POINTSIZE

          - signals that the contents of any TH (text height) entry is treated  as
            a  point  size,  instead  of  the  usual  mm./100  for  the default of
            /NOPOINTSIZE, and converted into mm.  in DXF.

  /[NO]QUIET

          - enables the suppression  of  a  range  of  messages  during  the  data
            translation  to  be  displayed  on  the terminal, including COLNOTMAT,
            LINEUSED and POLYUSED.

  [1mDESCRIPTION[0m

            After the command line is decoded, relevant files will be opened.  The
            program   then  scans  through  the  parameter  file  to  extract  the
            definitions of the  lookup  mapping  between  the  two  formats.   The
            mapping  of  IFF/DXF layers and that of IFF features/DXF entities will
            then be  defined  and  stored.   If  a  /LOG  qualifier  is  included,
            informational  messages  will  be  displayed to inform the user of the
            number of layers,  features/entities,  symbols/blocks,  linetypes  and
            text  styles  found  in the parameter file.  Any illegal command entry
            will cause a warning message to be issued.  Other errors  detected  in
            this stage will cause the program to abort.

            After the mapping between the two formats is successfully defined, the
            program  then  accesses the Feature Representation Table (FRT) file to
            check for the validity of Feature Code (FC) and colour entries in  the
            ENTITY  lookup  table.   Again,  the  program  will warn if any of the
            feature codes specified in the parameter file cannot be found  in  the
            FRT file.  Otherwise, the Graphical Type (GT) of the feature code will
            be  stored  for  later  matching  purposes.   The  program  will  also
            cross-check  the  colours  specified  in  the parameter file and those
            found in the FRT file.  In case of any difference, a  warning  message
            (COLNOTMAT) will be displayed (which may be suppressed with the /QUIET
            qualifier).  Users should note that colours  explicitly  specified  in
            the  parameter  file will have a higher priority over those in the FRT
            file for a given feature code.

            The next stage is the construction of the HEADER section of the output
            DXF  file.  The numerical values of the 'RA' entry in the IFF file are
            used for the  translation  into  the  DXF  map  extents  ($EXTMIN  and
            $EXTMAX).   I2DXF  does  not  support  the colour or linetype by layer
            formats in I2DXF and thus the $CECOLOR or $CELTYPE entries in the  DXF
            HEADER  section  will  be  filled with standard defaults ($CECOLOR = 0
            (BYBLOCK), $CELTYPE = CONTINUOUS and  $TEXTSTYLE  =  STANDARD).   This
            means  that  all  entities  in  the output DXF file will have a colour
            index (62 group) and line style  (6  group)  attached  to  them.   The
            colour index entry in DXF LAYER table will be undefined.

            If the /HEADER qualifier is given, an  area  feature  in  layer  0  is
            expected  (with  FSN  1, FC 0), containing type 6 AC's with DXF HEADER
            variables and their values in  the  text  fields.   The  program  will
            search for this feature, ignoring any others preceding it, in order to
            fill the HEADER section, so ideally this feature should be  the  first
            in  the  IFF file.  An error message will result if this feature could
            not be found, or there was  an  error  reading  it.   A  list  of  the
            supported  variables and their format is given in the DXF2I section of
            this manual.  These variables will override the default ones mentioned
            above.

            The HEADER section is followed by a TABLES section.  I2DXF  makes  use
            of  the  data  read  from the parameter file and outputs relevant data
            into the LTYPE, STYLE and LAYER tables.  These tables define  the  DXF
            linetype, text style and layer characteristics.

            All line types referenced in the parameter  file  are  output  to  the
            LTYPE  table.   Each  one  is  compared  to  the  default  line  types
            (CONTINUOUS, DASHED etc.) defined in the 'DATA  PREPARATION'  section,
            and  the  relevant fields filled.  Any not found in this default setup
            will be output as if for 'CONTINUOUS'.

            All text styles referenced in the parameter file  are  output  to  the
            STYLE  table.   Each  one  is  compared  to  the  default  text styles
            (STANDARD,  ROMANC  or  ROMANT)  defined  in  the  'DATA  PREPARATION'
            section,  and  the  relevant  fields  filled.   Any  not found in this
            default setup will be output as if for 'STANDARD'.

            All layer entries in the parameter file  will  create  a  LAYER  table
            entry.   The  layer  colour (62 group) will be set to the original IFF
            layer number.

            The next section is  the  BLOCKS  section  which  defines  the  symbol
            definition.   Each  INSERT  entry  in  the parameter file references a
            BLOCK entry, with the parameter file colour  being  used  for  the  62
            group  entry.   The  entities  constituting the BLOCK are omitted, and
            only the symbol name, colour and  default  line  type  CONTINUOUS  are
            used.

            The last section in a DXF file is the ENTITIES section which  contains
            the  graphical  data of the drawing.  The graphical entities supported
            by I2DXF are LINE, POINT, CIRCLE, ARC, TRACE, SOLID, TEXT, INSERT  and
            POLYLINE.   The program accesses the IFF file, sequentially extracting
            each feature code (FC) and its resident layer name, and from  its  FRT
            entry  individual  feature characteristics can be extracted and output
            to the DXF file entity referenced in the parameter file for the FC.

            The parameter file layer entries are used to map the IFF layer  number
            to  DXF  layer  name.   If  a particular IFF layer is missing from the
            parameter file, the program searches for the next EO  entry,  omitting
            all  features  in  this  layer.   In  this way undesired layers may be
            skipped from the translation.  An error message will result if the end
            of layer EO entry can not be found.

            Text heights (TH entries) are by default assumed to  be  in  units  of
            mm./100.   However,  they  can  be  treated  as  point  sizes  if  the
            /POINTSIZE qualifier is given.  Both value types are converted to  mm.
            in  the  DXF  file.  If the TH entry is absent, or its value zero, the
            FRT value (mm.) is used, if present.  If not, the text height will  be
            omitted.

            The z coordinates in any ZS (3-d) entry is  output  to  the  group  30
            field  complementing  the groups 10 and 20 for x and y.  Any height in
            type 2 or 3 AC entry is output to a group 38 elevation field  for  the
            particular entity.

            Users are strongly advised to refer to the 'DATA PREPARATION'  section
            about the mapping restrictions from IFF features to DXF entities.

            Informational messages about  the  conversion  will  be  displayed  at
            various  stages of the process provided the /LOG qualifier is included
            in the user command line.

  ANGCOIN, Angles calculated for ARC coincident.

      [1mExplanation:[0m  The angles calculated from the data given in the IFF file  are
      coincident with each other.  This is obviously an error from the input data.
      If the angles are really equal, the arc should be stored as  a  CIRCUMCIRCLE

      instead of LINE.  LINE is the entity type currently specified by the user in
      the parameter file.  POLYLINE entity type is used here because the number of

  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by

            with  respect  to the origin contained in the $EXTMIN header variable.
            The default action is to output  the  DXF  coordinates  as  local  IFF
            coordinates.

  /FRT=file-spec

          - specifies an FRT file containing definitions of feature  codes  to  be
            read in.  These definitions will then be used to identify the features
            read in the IFF file.  The default is LSL$FRT:DXF.FRT.  This qualifier
            is mandatory.

  /[NO]HEADER

          - enables the creation of an area feature in layer 0 from the  DXF  file
            header  variables  $EXTMIN/$EXTMAX  (also  defining  the IFF range) to
            which certain DXF header variables are output to  text  fields  of  AC
            entries.

  /[NO]LOG

          - enables a range of informational messages concerning the  progress  of
            the data translation to be displayed at the terminal.

  /PARAMETER=file-spec

          - specifies the parameter  file  which  defines  the  transformation  of
            entity  types,  line  type/text  style/block name and colour in DXF to
            feature codes in the IFF file.  It also defines the transformation  of
            layer  names  in DXF to layer numbers in IFF.  The parameter file-spec
            is parsed from the default LSL$LOOKUP:DXF.PAR.  Any part of  the  file
            name  which is not specified by the /PARAMETER qualifier will be taken
            from the above default specification.   This  qualifier  is  forbidden
            with the /SCAN qualifier.

  /[NO]POINTSIZE

          - specifies that the DXF text heights (in mm.) are  converted  to  point
            sizes  for  the TH (text height) entries, instead of the usual mm./100
            for the default of /NOPOINTSIZE.

  /[NO]QUIET

          - enables the suppression of a range of warning messages  output  during
            the  data  translation,  eg.   RANGEUPDATE  warning  that a coordinate
            exceeded the header range, MISENTCOL warning about the  absence  of  a
            colour  entry in an entity, COLNOTMAT warning that the colour given in
            the parameter file does not match that of the specified FC in the  FRT
            file,  and DEFLINTYP and DEFTEXSTY indicating that a default line type
            (from $CELTYPE  or  'CONTINUOUS'),  text  style  (from  $TEXTSTYLE  or
            'STANDARD')  or layer name (from $CLAYER) is being used, and should be
            present in  the  parameter  file,  or  a  default  text  height  (from
            $TEXTSIZE or 5 mm.) will be used.

  /SCAN=file-spec

          - specifies an output parameter file to be created from  the  DXF  file,
            with  default values for the IFF settings.  This scan file can then be
            used as the  parameter  file  for  further  runs  of  DXF2I  with  the
            specified  FRT  file.   The  scan file-spec is parsed from the default
            LSL$LOOKUP:DXF.SCAN.  Any part of the file name which is not specified
            by   the  /SCAN  qualifier  will  be  taken  from  the  above  default
            specification.   This  qualifier  is  forbidden  with  the  /PARAMETER
            qualifier, or with an output IFF file parameter on the command line.

            After the command line  has  been  decoded,  relevant  files  will  be
            opened.  The mode of operation of DXF2I depends mainly on the presence
            of the /SCAN qualifier, ie.  whether to  create  an  output  IFF  file
            using an existing parameter file, or to create a default parameter (or
            scan) file from the contents of the  DXF  file.   The  /SCAN  mode  of
            operation  is  described  in  detail later.  The following description
            relates to the normal operation of creating an IFF file.

            The program first scans through the  parameter  file  to  extract  the
            definitions  of  the  lookup  mapping between the two formats.  Lookup
            mapping of IFF/DXF layers and that of IFF features/DXF  entities  will
            then  be  defined  and  stored.   If  a  /LOG  qualifier  is included,
            informational messages will be displayed to inform  the  user  of  the
            number  of  layers,  features/entities, symbols/blocks, line types and
            text styles found in the parameter file.  Any  illegal  command  entry
            will  cause  a warning message to be issued.  Other errors detected at
            this stage will cause the program to abort.

            After the mapping between the two formats is successfully defined, the
            program  then  accesses the Feature Representation Table (FRT) file to
            check for the validity of Feature Code (FC) and Colour entries in  the
            ENTITY  lookup  table.   Again,  the  program  will warn if any of the
            feature codes specified in the parameter file cannot be found  in  the
            FRT file.  Otherwise, the Graphical Type (GT) of the feature code will
            be stored for later matching purposes.  The program  will  also  cross
            check  the  colours specified in the parameter file and those found in
            the FRT file.  In case of any difference, a warning  message  will  be
            displayed.  Users should note that colours explicitly specified in the
            parameter file will have a higher priority over those in the FRT  file


  IFFDXF REFERENCE (2.0): DXF2I utility                                   Page 4-4
  UTILITY DXF2I                                                  30 September 1994


            for a given feature code.

            The next stage of the conversion is the scanning of the HEADER section
            in  the  DXF file.  The entries $EXTMIN and $EXTMAX are used to set up
            the 'RA' range and 'CP' entries of the IFF  file.   The  range  values
            will  be  updated by the coordinate values from the ENTITIES or BLOCKS
            sections as they are encountered in  the  DXF  file  (with  a  warning
            message),  and  the  'RA' entry updated at the end of the program run.
            The $CECOLOR entry (if there is one) will be read for  any  colour  by
            layer  flag, and is stored for later use (see below), and the @CELTYPE
            entry for any linetype by layer flag.  Any other default settings  are
            stored.

            If the DXF file for any reason does  not  contain  a  HEADER  section,
            default  header  IFF  entries  will  be written and a suitable warning
            message given.  This means that any parameter file will be meaningless
            for  a  DXF file that was supposed to be colour-by-layer, for example,
            as the layers and flags will be missing.

            By default, a type 2 map descriptor entry (MD2) is  created  with  all
            fields  unset, with a map scale MD2SCL field set to 1.0 and the MD2LOC
            local origin set to (0,0).

            If the /HEADER qualifier was given, a bounding area feature is created
            in  layer  0 with FC 0, FSN 1 from the DXF header extents, and certain
            header variables are output to  AC  entries  for  this  feature.   The
            header variables transferred to AC's (type 6) at present are:


                  $CECOLOR    Entity colour number: 0 = BYBLOCK, 256 = BYLAYER
                  $CELTYPE    Entity linetype name or BYBLOCK or BYLAYER
                  $CLAYER     Current layer name
                  $LUNITS     Units format for coordinates and distances
                  $LUPREC     Units precision for coordinates and distances
                  $PDMODE     Point display mode
                  $PDSIZE     Point display size
                  $TDCREATE   Date/time of drawing creation
                  $TDINDWG    Cumulative editing time for this drawing 
                  $TDUPDATE   Date/time of last drawing update
                  $TDUSRTIMER User elapsed timer
                  $TEXTSIZE   Default text height
                  $TEXTSTYLE  Current text style name
                  $UCSNAME    Name of current UCS
                  $UCSORG     Origin of current UCS (in WCS)
                  $UCSXDIR    Direction of current UCS X axis (in World coords)
                  $UCSYDIR    Direction of current UCS Y axis (in World coords)


            The text fields of the AC entries will be in the following format:


                 '$CECOLOR 256'
                 '$TEXTSIZE 3.0'
                 '$TEXTSTYLE STANDARD'
                 '$UCSXDIR 1.0 0.0 0.0'

            If it is desired to enter different HEADER values into DXF with I2DXF,
            this  format  must  be observed, with spaces between the variable name
            and its value or values.

            The next section to be scanned is the  TABLES  section.   At  present,
            only  three  tables,  LTYPE, LAYER and STYLE, are used.  Data from the
            parameter file is used to check if  there  are  any  undefined  LTYPE,
            LAYER  or  STYLE  entries,  with  warnings  given  if  there  were any
            absences.  If the entities are coloured or line-typed  by  layer,  the
            colour  index  (62  group)  and line type (6 group) of the LAYER table
            will be stored.  Any error encountered at this stage  will  cause  the
            program to abort.

            The next section to be scanned is the BLOCKS section.  Each BLOCK  has
            a  unique  name and is referenced by DXF INSERT entities.  These BLOCK
            names should be referenced to symbol FC's in the parameter file.   The
            program will cross check these BLOCK names found against those entries
            in the parameter file, with warnings given if there were any absences.

            The BLOCKS may be composed of entities, building up a complex  symbol,
            referenced  to  their  local  coordinates,  and would be output at the
            defining location and scale of the INSERT entity later.  These  BLOCKS
            may  also  be  composed  of  other  BLOCKS  in  a  hierarchy of symbol
            definitions.  Because there is at present no  mechanism  in  DXF2I  of
            storing these complex arrangements of entities in a symbol, the BLOCKS
            entities may be output to the IFF file as they are  read  here  as  if
            they  were  normal entities.  This is achieved by specifying an EXPAND
            entry in the parameter file for the BLOCK (symbol) name, together with
            x,y,z  offsets  and  scalings  used  to  convert  the  internal symbol
            coordinates to world coordinates.  These would be the INSERTion  point
            coordinates  for  a  single  level  of  BLOCK nesting.  For a multiply
            nested  hierarchy  of  blocks,  these  offsets  and  scalings   should
            represent the combination of the individual INSERT positions.

            If the offsets or scalings in the DXF  file  are  not  known,  put  an
            EXPAND  entry  in  the  parameter  file  with default offsets of 0 and
            default scalings of 1, together with an INSERT  entry  for  all  known
            BLOCKS  in  the  file,  and  wait for the warning messages DIFFEXPOFF,
            DIFFEXPZOFF, DIFFEXPSCALE or DIFFEXPZSCALE which  will  give  out  any
            offsets and scalings that are different from the defaults.

            The whole symbol may still be represented by an  IFF  symbol  with  an
            INSERT  symbol_name  in  the  parameter  file  to derive the FC in the
            normal way.

            For complex hierarchies of BLOCKS, several symbols may  be  output  to
            the  IFF  file, representing different levels of the hierarchy at each
            INSERT point, and may it may be better to leave out the higher  levels
            from the parameter file which will only generate the message UNDEFBLK,
            without processing the  symbol,  relying  on  the  lower  level  BLOCK
            entities  being output as features through the EXPAND mechanism.  This
            is illustrated in the example parameter file below.

            It is possible for entities to  be  coloured  BYBLOCK.   This  is  not
            supported  by  DXF2I, and is overridden by any colouring by layer.  It
            is also possible to set the line type BYBLOCK, and in  this  case  the


  IFFDXF REFERENCE (2.0): DXF2I utility                                   Page 4-6
  UTILITY DXF2I                                                  30 September 1994


            line  type  'BYBLOCK'  must  be present in the parameter file for a FC
            match to be found.  Here again the layer colour (if any) will override
            the colour entry of '0' (equivalent to BYBLOCK).

            The ENTITIES section contains the graphical data of the drawing.   The
            graphical  entities  supported  by DXF2I are LINE, POINT, CIRCLE, ARC,
            TRACE, SOLID, TEXT, INSERT and POLYLINE.  The program then  reads  the
            DXF  input  file  sequentially  to  extract  each entity's type, name,
            colour and, according to the  entity  types,  their  other  individual
            characteristics.   If  the  entities are coloured by LAYER, the colour
            index  value  of  the  entity's  resident  layer  will  override   its
            individual  colour  index, and the layer colour must be present in the
            parameter file for the particular entity  type/line  type  combination
            for a IFF feature code to be found.

            If the group 62 entity colour field is  absent  without  colouring  by
            layer,  the feature code will be derived from the parameter file using
            the first occurrence of entity  type  and  line  style,  so  that  the
            coordinate data may still be transferred.

            Text heights in mm.  in the DXF file  are  converted  to  the  default
            units  of  mm./100  for TH entries, unless the /POINTSIZE qualifier is
            given, when they will be converted into point sizes.

            If present, the group 30 z coordinate fields will be converted into ZS
            entries.  Any group 38 elevation fields will be converted to type 3 AC
            entries.

            Users are strongly advised to  refer  to  'DATA  PREPARATION'  section
            about the mapping restrictions from DXF entities to IFF features.

            Informational messages about  the  conversion  will  be  displayed  at
            various  stages of the process provided the /LOG qualifier is included
            in the user command line.  Some warning messages  may  be  turned  off
            with the /QUIET qualifier.

            In the /SCAN mode of operation of DXF2I, a default parameter  file  is
            to  be  created  from  the  DXF  file, and no output IFF file created.
            /SCAN is intended to be of use in cases where  a  DXF  file  has  been
            received  without  a  description of the entities or layers within it.
            It allows the operator to produce a useable template parameter file.

            The messages output are essentially the same as for a  normal  run  of
            DXF2I, mainly to inform on the validity of the input DXF file, without
            the output of any concerning the mismatch  of  entities  to  parameter
            file.   Apart from the /SCAN = scan-file, the command line is the same
            as for the normal run of DXF2I except that the output IFF file is  not
            required,  and  the  /PARAMETER  file qualifier is forbidden.  The FRT
            file must still be provided for the scan to find  a  suitable  feature
            code to be output to the SCAN file.

            After conversion using this template, the resultant IFF  file  can  be
            viewed  using  LITES2.  The template file can then be edited to choose
            more appropriate feature codes, and the DXF data  converted  again  to
            obtain  the required IFF file.  When /SCAN has been used on an unknown
            DXF file, it is important to consider the scale of the data,  as  this

  UTILITY DXF2I                                                  30 September 1994


            affects  the  representation.   Program  IINFO in the IMP package will
            report the range of coordinates encountered, and  programs  IPATCH  or
            ITRANS/DESCRIPTOR  in  the IMP package can be used to set the scale in
            the IFF MD entry, which will be  used  by  display  programs  such  as
            LITES2.   Command  SHOW  SCALE  in  LITES2 is useful to check that the
            scale is set sensibly (eg.  that "Extent of working area" is  a  valid
            paper size).

            First the DXF layer names are read from the TABLES section  LAYERs  or
            BLOCKs  and  output  to  the  SCAN  file,  with  the  IFF layer number
            increased by one for each output.  Then the ENTITIES section is  read.
            For  each  combination of entity type, line type/text style/block name
            and colour, a new line is output to the  SCAN  file  with  a  suitable
            feature code obtained from the FRT file (the first feature code in the
            file for the relevant graphical type contained in the FRT  file).   If
            there  is no suitable FC available, a value of -1 will be used to flag
            an unset FC value, which must be edited before the scan  file  can  be
            used as the parameter file for subsequent normal runs of DXF2I on this
            DXF file.

            Each entity line and layer line output to the SCAN file is stored  for
            later  comparison  to ensure that they are all unique combinations.  A
            message TOOMNYENTS or TOOMNYLAYS will be output if either array  limit
            is  about to be exceeded, after which no more comparisons are possible
            and the entity lines are output regardless of their uniqueness.

            One important message to be noted is  ERRSCANLAY,  where  a  layer  is
            referenced  in  the entities section that was not present in the LAYER
            TABLEs or BLOCKs sections.  As the program is now writing the entities
            to the scan file, it is too late to output the missing layers, and the

  In addition to the above messages which are generated  by  the  program  itself,
  other  messages  may  be  produced  by the command line interpreter (CLI) and by
  Laser-Scan libraries.  In particular, messages  may  be  generated  by  the  IFF
  library  and  by  the  Laser-Scan I/O library, LSLLIB.  IFF library messages are
  introduced by '%IFF' and are documented in the IFF  library  users'  guide.   In
  most  cases  IFF  errors will be due to a corrupt input file, and this should be
  the first area of investigation.  If the cause of the error cannot be traced  by
  the user, and Laser-Scan are consulted, then the output file should be preserved
  to facilitate diagnosis.  LSLLIB messages are introduced by  '%LSLLIB'  and  are
  generally  self-explanatory.   They  are  used to explain the details of program
  generated errors.
