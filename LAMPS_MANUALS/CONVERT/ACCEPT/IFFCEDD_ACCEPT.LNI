  1  [1mINTRODUCTION[0m

  This document describes the acceptance test procedure for the Laser-Scan  Module
  IFFCEDD in the CONVERT package.

  IFFCEDD is a module containing two utilities, I2CEDD and CEDD2I, which have been
  designed  to  transfer between Laser-Scan Internal Feature Format (IFF) files on
  disc, and International Organisation  Committee  on  Exchange  of  Digital  Data
  (CEDD) format files on disc or magnetic tape.

  The IFFCEDD module contains the utilities I2CEDD, for transfer from IFF to  CEDD
  format, and CEDD2I, for transfer from CEDD format to IFF.

  Data input to the IFFCEDD module is from IFF disc file and CEDD format  magnetic
  tape  or  disc  file.   Output  from  the  module is to IFF file and CEDD format
  magnetic tape or disc file.



  2  [1mOVERVIEW[0m

  For the purpose of acceptance, an IFF file containing  feature  coordinate  data
  and attribute information is provided.

  In order to carry out acceptance for the  tape  conversion  modules  I2CEDD  and
  CEDD2I,  a  scratch  magnetic  tape  is required, and should be loaded on a tape
  drive.  The acceptance procedure will inquire the name of the tape drive.

  Acceptance will be performed using a supplied DCL command  procedure  to  invoke
  the CEDD utilities.

  The acceptance procedure is invoked by typing [1m@LSL$COM:IFFCEDD_ACCEPT[0m



  3  [1mDESCRIPTION OF ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE[0m

  The acceptance procedure first demonstrates the utility I2CEDD.  I2CEDD is  used
  to  transfer  the  coordinate  data and attribute information in a IFF file to a
  CEDD format magnetic tape.

  The VMS utility DUMP is then invoked to examine the first 2 blocks on  the  tape
  to confirm the writing of a CEDD dataset.

  The utility CEDD2I is then demonstrated by the acceptance procedure.  CEDD2I  is
  used  to transfer the coordinate data and attribute information on a CEDD format
  magnetic tape to an IFF disc file.

  Finally, the utility IDIFFERENCE, from the IMP package, is  used  to  illustrate
  that  the  initial  IFF  file,  as read by I2CEDD, is essentially similar to the
  final IFF file, as written by CEDD2I.

  Acceptance for the two IFFCEDD tape utilities I2CEDD  and  CEDD2I  is  performed
  together,  since  CEDD2I  is  used  to verify that the CEDD format tape has been
  correctly written by I2CEDD.  In order to carry out acceptance, a magnetic  tape
  should be loaded on a tape device.  This should be a scratch tape as I2CEDD will
  overwrite any existing data on the tape.  You will be asked to supply  the  tape

  device  name as part of acceptance.  Note that the tape should be loaded but not
  mounted.

  I2CEDD is used to transfer CEDD data held in  an  IFF  file  to  a  CEDD  format
  magnetic   tape.   The  format  of  this  tape  is  detailed  in  the  IHO  CEDD
  Specification.  I2CEDD will be run to transfer data from the provided IFF  file.
  When  I2CEDD  is  run, the tape is initialised, and the data is written to it in
  CEDD format.

  The transfer of data to and from the tape may take some  time,  so  patience  is
  advisable.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  DUMP is used to list the first 2 blocks on the magnetic tape to demonstrate that
  a CEDD format tape has been created.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  CEDD2I is used to convert data from CEDD  format  magnetic  tape  to  IFF  file.
  CEDD2I  will  be run to transfer a map sheet from the tape.  When the program is
  run the map sheet written to the tape by I2CEDD is transferred to a  second  IFF
  file.

                                                                 [1mPass [ ]/Fail [ ][0m

  To confirm that the data has been correctly read  from  tape,  the  IMP  utility
  IDIFFERENCE  may  be  used  to  compare  the  file  generated by CEDD2I with the
  original  file.   If  file  transfer  has  been  correctly  performed  the  only
  differences  should be in the IFF History (HI) entry and in the NS entry.  There
  should be no differences reported in the IFF  feature  coordinates  or  analysis
  codes.
