       IFNODE is a utility which takes a junction IFF file (usually created  using
       LAJ,  VTRAK or IFJ), extracts the junction positions from it and creates an
       output IFF file (of default type .NDE)  containing  these  nodes  as  point
       symbols.   This file may then be plotted as it stands, or merged with other
       IFF data.  Facilities are  available  for  specifying  which  overlay  will
       contain  the  point  symbols,  which  feature code is to be associated with
       them, and their size (THickness) if appropriate.

       IFNODE is normally defined as a foreign command.   The  command  syntax  of
       this  utility  conforms  to  (and  is  in  fact  more general than) that of
       standard VAX/VMS programs, and is (in its most general form):

           IFNODE [/OVERLAY=n] [/CODE=n] [/SIZE=n] [FROM] infile [[TO] outfile]

       The following switches are recognised:

           /OVERLAY=n
           /LAYER=n

           Specifies the number of  the  overlay  which  will  contain  the  point
           features.

           /CODE=n
           /FCODE=n
           /FEATURE_CODE=n

           Specifies which feature code they will have (i.e.  sets the first  word
           in the FS entries).

           /SIZE=n
           /THICKNESS=n

           Specifies their size if the symbols are scalable  (i.e.   sets  the  TH
           entries).


       All switches may be abbreviated (but must, of course, be unambiguous).   If
       a switch is specified, it MUST be given an (integer) argument, e.g.

           IFNODE/OV=5/FC=54 FRED

       which  will  take  IFF  file   LSL$IF:FRED.IFF   and   produce   IFF   file
       LSL$IF:FRED.NDE  with  layer  5  and  feature  codes  of 54.  The following
       examples illustrate the command syntax:

           IFNODE/OV=5/FC=54 FRED JIM

           IFNODE/OV=3 FROM FRED TO .TMP

           IFNODE/FC=7/SIZE=20 TO JIM FROM FRED


                                                                            Page 3



           IFNODE/OV=5/FC=54 FRED [JIM]

       Error messages produced by IFNODE conform to VAX/VMS conventions,  and  are
       hopefully all self-explanatory.  In addition, IFNODE sets $STATUS and hence
       any failure may be detected from within command files.
