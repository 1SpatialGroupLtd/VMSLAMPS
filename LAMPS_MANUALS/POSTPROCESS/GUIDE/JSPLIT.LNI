  UTILITY:   JSPLIT

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  REPLACES:  JSPLIT is a new utility.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  FUNCTION:  JSPLIT is a utility which enables the user  to take a  file
             produced by LAJ or VTRAK and create a non-junction IFF file
             which  has  the features containing junctions split down to
             sub-features at the junctions, all junction  entries  being
             lost in the process.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  FORMAT:

  $ JSPLIT input-file-spec output-file-spec


  Command qualifiers                              Defaults

  /LOG                                     No log is printed at run end
  /RENUMBER                                Do not renumber all features

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PROMPTS:

  _IFJ file to split   :        input-file-spec
  _IFF file for output :        output-file-spec

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  DESCRIPTION:

       The program is intended  for  use  on  IFF  files  which  contain
  junctions.   The  features which contain junctions will if possible be
  sub-divided  to  'daughter'  features  which  will  retain   all   the
  attributes  of  the 'parent' feature.  The FSN will remain the same or
  be altered depending on  the  RENUMBER  qualifier.   If  the  RENUMBER
  qualifier has been issued, all the features as they are written to the
  output file will be assigned a new FSN, whereas if the  qualifier  has
  not  been  issued  the  'daughter'  features  will retain the 'parent'
  feature's FSN, as well as the rest of the parent attributes (e.g.  AC,
  RO and TH entries).

       A default specification of LSL$IF:IFF.IFF is used for both  input
  and output files.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  COMMAND QUALIFIERS:

  /LOG            - Display  input filename,  output filename,  original
                    number of  features,  final number  of  features and
                    number of features created.

  /RENUMBER       - All features in output file to be assigned a new FSN
                    (Feature Serial Number).

  EXAMPLE:

  $ JSPLIT/RENUMBER/LOG TEST2.IFF IFF3.IFF
  INPUT FILE          LSL$IF:TEST2.IFF
  OUTPUT FILE         LSL$IF:IFF3.IFF
  Features in       =     23
  Features out      =     91
  Features created  =     68
  process complete
  ELAPSED: 00:01:19.87  CPU: 0:00:03.04  BUFIO: 10 DIRIO: 41 FAULTS: 102

  In this example all the  qualifiers  have  been  specified.   The  LOG
  qualifier causes all the messages other than the run statistics.
