       Based on user-specified criteria, IFJ forms junctions from line segments in
       an  IFF  file,  and  creates  a full 'link and node' IFF junction structure
       suitable for subsequent processing (e.g.  using  IFNODE).   It  produces  a
       separate output file of type .IFJ and does not affect the input file in any
       way.  Any junction entries already present in the input  file  (correct  or
       incorrect) are ignored and not reflected in the output file.

       Optional switches available are:-

       /NS:<int>:<int>
           To aid searching for matching junctions the IFF file is  considered  to
           be  split  up  into  a grid of sectors.  This switch allows the user to
           specify the number of sectors  required  in  the  X  and  Y  directions
           respectively  (/NS:5:5  would  result in a 5 x 5 grid).  The default is
           10 x 10.

       /TO:<real>
           This switch allows the user to specify a tolerance which is  used  when
           deciding  if  end-points  meet  at  the  same junction.  The real value
           should be specified in the same units as the IFF data being  processed.
           The default is 0.0.

           Segments which are  recognised  as  being  connected  to  a  particular
           junction  will  have their end-points adjusted to match the position of
           the junction.  The position of the junction is set to be  the  same  as
           the end-point of the first segment considered.

       /AR:<int>
           This is used to specify the maximum number of arms that a junction  can
           have (default 4).  If a junction with more than the specified number is
           found then an error occurs.  Note that ALL junctions  created  will  be
           allocated  this  number  of  arms,  and  that at the end of the run any
           unwanted arms will simply not be  set.   This  could  be  a  source  of
           confusion for the unwary!

       /TY
           This enables diagnostic typing.  All IFF entries  found  in  the  input
           file are reflected on the users terminal.  This is useful for detecting
           the positions of obscure errors in the data but should not be  used  in
           normal circumstances.

       /OV:n:m:...
           This  selects  particular  layers  (overlays)  n,m,...   for   junction
           formation.   Up to 50 layers may be selected.  Features in other layers
           are not considered, but are copied to the output file.  In the  absence
           of this switch, all layers are selected.

       The program is usually set up as a foreign command, and may then be invoked
       by, for example:

           $ IFJ
           IFJ> filename/AR:5/TO:2.0
           IFJ> ^Z
           $


                                                                            Page 3


       IFJ adds junctions onto  the  ends  of  all  features  found  in  the  file
       (including  layers  0  and  32  at  the  moment).   'Islands'  (loops) will
       therefore have a common junction for both end-points if  these  are  within
       the   specified   tolerance   (LAJ   and  VTRAK  should  produce  identical
       end-points).

       Errors in the data likely to be detected by IFJ are:-

       'No room in junction at position (X,Y) for new arm.'
           The suggested solution is to use LITES2 to check the offending junction
           and, if necessary, to increase the number of arms allowed using the /AR
           switch as appropriate.  If the junction on the original  map  does  not
           contain  an  excessive  number  of  arms  then  the tolerance should be
           checked.

       'Unexpected sector <int> found - check RAnge.'
           This means that the values in the IFF RAnge entry do not represent  the
           true extent of the data.  Consequently the data outside the given range
           is outside of the known sectors (sector positions  are  generated  from
           the RAnge).  The solution is to set the RAnge correctly.

       'Warning - segment in NF <int> already has zero length or repeated points'
           The specified feature contains invalid data in the form of single point
           ST  entries  or  strings  where  the  first  (or  last)  two points are
           superimposed (making it impossible to calculate the arm angles).

       In addition, the following warning message may occur:

       'Warning - segment in NF <int> shrunk to zero length'
       'To keep this segment, the tolerance would have to be less than <real>'
           The specified tolerance is such that  two  'junctions'  which  may,  in
           reality,  be  distinct  have  been merged into one, causing the segment
           joining them to be shrunk to zero length.  IFJ tells you what tolerance
           is   required   to   retain   this  segment.   In  some  circumstances,
           unfortunately,  there  may  be  a  conflict  of  interests  where  poor
           digitising requires a large tolerance in order to avoid 'hanging arms',
           but where a  number  of  very  close  junctions  exist  which  must  be
           preserved.   At  present  the only course of action is to edit the data
           such that a smaller tolerance can be used successfully.   If  all  else
           fails,  the  short segment can be deleted and the junctions merged into
           one.  In any case, you MUST take some action if this  message  appears,
           as  the  file  created  by  IFJ  is,  strictly  speaking, corrupt if it
           contains zero length segments.
