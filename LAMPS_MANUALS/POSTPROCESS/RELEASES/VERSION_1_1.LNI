  This document describes  recent  changes  to  the  Laser-Scan  software  package
  POSTPROCESS.   This  is  a  support  package  for  Laser-Scan packages VTRAK and
  LASERAID.  Details of POSTPROCESS functionality and commands can be found in the
  VTRAK  or  LASERAID  documentation  set.   This  document  covers the changes to
  package POSTPROCESS since the previous general release of POSTPROCESS  software,
  which  was  frozen  ready  for  issue  on 01-Nov-1989.  At that time, the extant
  version of POSTPROCESS was described as V1.0.

           This enables those programs to process  IFF  files  created  using  IFF
           output revision level 1.  Previous versions reported 'BINC' (bad binary
           code) errors when presented with a level 1 IFF file.

           This resolves a problem with IFF history (HI) entries which are created
           by  VTRAK.   Previous  versions  of  IFNODE reported 'BINC' (bad binary
           code) errors when presented with an IFF file containing these entries.

           The switch /OV:n:m:...  will restrict junction formation to the ends of
           features in the selected overlays.  All features in other overlays will
           be copied without change.  In the absence of the  switch  all  features
           are used to form junctions, which was the original function.
