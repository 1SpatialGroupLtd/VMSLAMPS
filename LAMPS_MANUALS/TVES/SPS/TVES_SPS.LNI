  2  [1mPackage[0m [1mTVES[0m [1m-[0m [1minput[0m

  The TVES Package is designed to exploit a  grid  based  Digital  Terrain  Matrix
  (DTM)  held within Laser-Scan's Digital Terrain Image (DTI) format.  It allows a
  customer to derive additional geographic measures  such  as  slope,  aspect  and
  visibility  information  from  the  elevation  data.   The package also contains
  facilities to display grid based data in combination with vector geographic data
  in  both  2  and  3 dimensional representations, and modules to allow conversion
  between grid (raster) and vector formats.



  3  [1mINPUT[0m

  The TVES Package requires grid based data to be  held  in  Laser-Scan's  Digital
  Terrain  Image (DTI) format, and vector data to be held in Laser-Scan's Internal
  Feature Format (IFF).



  4  [1mOUTPUT[0m

  Data  output  and  data  conversion  is  to  either  the  DTI  format  as   grid
  representation or to IFF as vector representation.

        o  A high resolution  Altek  Datatab  Digitising  Table  (or  similar  LSL
           approved  digitising  table), 16 button puck, and associated Laser-Scan
           Table Monitor System, are required for source document registration and
           command menu input

        o  Any DEC-compatible alphanumeric  terminal  (optional  if  the  graphics
           device has alphanumeric terminal capability).




  7  [1mSOFTWARE[0m [1mPREREQUISITES[0m

  TVES modules run under VAX VMS V5.4-3  (or  later  version,  assuming  continued
  upward  compatibility  by  DEC),  concurrently  with other interactive and batch
  processes.

  For the use of Motif on a VAXstation, the  "DECwindows  Motif"  layered  product
  from  DEC  is  required.   The  "VMS DECwindows Developers Kit for Motif" is not
  adequate.

  For the use of UIS on a VAXstation, VAX VMS Workstation Software  (VWS)  version
  4.3 or later is required.

  A minimum working set of at least 4000 pages  is  recommended.   Larger  working
  sets will help performance, particularly with large matrix files.

  Laser-Scan's [1mI[0mFF [1mM[0map  [1mP[0mrocessing  package  (IMP)  and  the  MATRIX  raster  data
  processing  package  are  essential.  Laser-Scan's LITES2 interactive digitising
  and editing  software  running  on  the  same  workstation  is  recommended  for
  digitising vector input data.  LASERTRAK automated digitising is recommended for
  large numbers of input documents.

  Package TVES consists of the following component modules:


  Package TVES Software Product Specification


  [1mMODULE[0m [1mCOVER[0m

  COVER determines which areas of the terrain surface are visible or  hidden  from
  the view of an observer.  The observer may be positioned on or above the terrain
  surface, and may represent either a human observer, or a device such as a  radio
  transmitter.

  The input to the module is a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and optionally  a  file
  with information on the heights of surface features.  The output is a grid based
  intervisibility or cover map, that may be displayed in colour coded  form  on  a
  graphics device, or manipulated using other TVES modules.

  Both input and output data are held in a Laser-Scan Digital Terrain Image  file.
  The main features of the program are:

        o  Use of the whole or part of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM)

        o  Registration of the DTM to a source document positioned on a digitising
           table

        o  Optional use of information on the height of surface features, such  as
           woodland, when determining visibility

        o  Optional compensation for the effect of earth curvature and terrestrial
           refraction

        o  Immediate calculation of visibility along a simple single line of sight

        o  Selection of up to 8 observers

        o  Full user control over the position (x,y,z) and cone of  view  of  each
           observer, as well as target distance and direction

        o  Coordinate input in grid, metres, or latlong units

        o  Display of  cover  information  relating  to  a  selected  observer  or
           observers

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTICHECK[0m

  The module DTICHECK is used to validate the data values in a DTI  file.   It  is
  generally  used  to  detect  possible problems in a Digital Terrain Model (DTM).
  Checks are made for:

        o  critical slopes defined by a user supplied threshold Z difference

        o  DTM posts having a zero Z value

        o  DTM posts having a negative Z value

        o  DTM posts having a null Z value

  The checks may be carried out singly or in any combination.

  Error output may be directed to either an IFF  file,  LITES2  command  file,  or
  ROVER  command  file.   The two command files may be used to aid the interactive
  correction of height errors in the DTM.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mDTIVIEWEXTRA[0m

  The module DTIVIEWEXTRA enables the  IFF  vector  overlay  options  in  DTIVIEW.
  These  options allow data describing surface features (eg.  rivers and woodland)
  to be drawn on a 3-D perspective or isometric terrain image.

  The primary use for the option is for  data  verification,  enhancement  of  the
  model,  and  for  Geographical Information System applications which involve the
  combined presentation of vector and raster data.

  Overlay facilities within DTIVIEW allow:

        o  Selection of features on the basis  of  feature  code,  feature  serial
           number or layer

        o  FRT and SRI control over the colour and symbolic representation of  the
           IFF features

        o  Automatic or user control over the registration of the vector data  and
           the DTM

        o  Separate manipulation of the Graphics Device planes  allocated  to  the

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mI2GRID[0m

  I2GRID is a module to convert data from  Laser-Scan's  Internal  Feature  Format
  (IFF)  to Laser-Scan's Digital Terrain Image (DTI) format.  In so doing the data
  is converted from a VECTOR to a GRID (raster) form; ie.  the data in  the  input
  IFF file is rasterised.

  In its rasterised form, the data may be manipulated and displayed using many  of
  the modules that form part of the Laser-Scan TVES and MATRIX packages.

  The module does not require a graphics device.


  The main features of I2GRID are:

        o  Vector to raster conversion of the whole or part of an IFF file

        o  Output of converted data to a new or existing grid file

        o  Selection of which feature attribute is stored in the output grid  file
           (eg.  feature code, height)

        o  Output of the data at any grid resolution (dependent on the application
           of the imagery)

        o  Conversion of point, line and area information

        o  Selection of which IFF features are converted on the basis  of  feature
           code, FSN or layer

        o  User control over the order in which features are converted

        o  Mechanism to allow  preset  attribute  values  to  be  associated  with
           selected features

        o  On-line help, and friendly command interface using user defined  lookup
           and feature representation tables.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mPROFILE[0m

  The module PROFILE is used to construct a series of path profile lines through a
  Digital  Terrain  Model  (DTM).  Typically, the origin of the profiles will be a
  base station, and the profile data will be used for radio frequency  propagation
  analysis.   Profiles are constructed either radially around the base station, or
  between each DTM node and the base station.  Options are provided in the program
  to restrict profile generation to a rectangular area of interest, or to a sector
  of interest.

  Input is a DTM, and optionally a  series  of  clutter  grid  files,  held  in  a
  Laser-Scan Digital Terrain Image (DTI) format.  The DTM defines the elevation of
  the terrain surface, while the clutter grid  file  contains  height  information
  relating  to surface features such as buildings, vegetation or water.  Output is
  to a Laser-Scan vector Internal Feature Format (IFF) file.

  Each profile is written to the IFF file as a separate feature.  The bearing  and
  length  of  the  profile  is  stored  in the IFF file, along with the x, y and z
  coordinates of the profile sample points.  Additionally a clutter index value is
  stored for each sample point.  The main features of the program are:

        o  Registration of the DTM to a source document positioned on a digitising
           table, and command input from the table puck

        o  Optional use of information on the height of surface features  such  as
           buildings and vegetation

        o  Construction of profiles either radially around the  base  station,  or
           between the base station and each DTM node

        o  Use of a constant sample interval or sample interval that  varies  with
           the distance of the sample point from the base station

        o  Restriction of profile generation to a rectangular area of interest, or
           to a sector of interest in the DTM

        o  Coordinate input in matrix, metres or latlong units.

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mROVER[0m

  ROVER displays both grid based and vector  geographic  data.   Output  is  to  a
  Laser-Scan  supported  graphics  device  or  colour electrostatic plotter.  When
  using a graphics device the user may interactively interrogate and edit the grid
  data.   The  grid  data  may take the form of a DTI (Digital Terrain Image) file
  containing  elevation,  slope  or  aspect  information,   shaded   overlay,   or
  remotely-sensed data (eg.  satellite imagery) data.

  The grid and vector data may be displayed independently,  but  more  importantly
  they  may  also  be  displayed  together using the program.  The user is able to
  derive considerable benefits from this integrated display:

       1.  in the areas of data validation and visualisation

       2.  when editing the grid data

       3.  through  the  derivation  of  other  geographic  information  from  the
           combined datasets


  Using a digitising table the user is able to move around and edit matrix values.
  Editing facilities within ROVER offer the option of editing a single data value,
  a line of values or all values within a defined area.   The  grid  data  may  be
  edited with reference to any overlaid vector information.

  ROVER provides a display link between Laser-Scan programs  that  manipulate  and
  display  grid and vector datasets.  The Laser-Scan programs that either generate
  or utilise digital terrain matrices (See the SPS for Packages DTMCREATE,  MATRIX
  and   TVES)   are  of  particular  relevance,  along  with  Laser-Scan's  vector
  cartographic editor (LITES2) and plotting program  (FPP).   The  modules  I2GRID
  (vector  to  raster  conversion) and VECTORISE (raster to vector conversion) are
  also significant for preparing data for display within ROVER.

  The main features of ROVER are:

        o  Full or quartered screen display

        o  Image zoom and roam under cursor control

        o  User control over allocation of device bit-planes  between  the  raster
           and vector pictures

        o  Selective manipulation and display of raster and vector pictures

        o  A range of interactive raster edit capabilities

        o  User control over colour tables  (defining  nature  of  raster  display
           colours and vector overlay colours)

        o  Ability to annotate the display with legend and user specified text

        o  Source document registration to grid or vector data

        o  Ability to  digitise  to  an  output  IFF  file,  using  the  displayed
           information as a guide

  [1mMODULE[0m [1mSLOPES[0m

  SLOPES generates slope or aspect information from elevation  data  held  in  the
  form  of  a  grid  based  DTM.   The module may also be used to produce a shaded
  overlay.  The derived information may be displayed as a classified  image  on  a
  suitable  colour  graphics  device,  or  may  be  output to a disk grid file for
  subsequent manipulation or fast display using modules within the TVES package.

  The information derived from the elevation data on slope and aspect represents a
  valuable  end  product  in  itself,  but more importantly may be an input into a
  Geographic Information System (GIS).

  SLOPES features are:

        o  Use of the whole or part of a digital terrain matrix

        o  Input of an area of interest in lat/long, metres or grid units

  The module VECTORISE allows grid based data (raster)  to  be  converted  into  a
  vector  IFF  representation.  Lines generated from the raster image by VECTORISE
  are the boundaries between areas in the grid file whose pixel values  fall  into
  user  defined  ranges.   The input grid file may contain a variety of geographic
  information ranging from elevation or slope data  to  remotely-sensed  satellite
  imagery.

  The main features of VECTORISE are:

        o  Use of the whole or part of a DTM

        o  Selection of data value range or series of ranges (real or integer)

        o  Output into a link-node structured IFF file

        o  Vector boundary generation

        o  Optional smoothing of the vector boundary data

        o  Progress and diagnostic display

        o  On-line help and full user documentation
