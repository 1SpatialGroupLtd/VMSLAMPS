VMS LAMPS Digital Mapping Software
=====

LAMPS was a commercial mapping tool running on the VMS operating system.

This is intended to be preserved for posterity, both as a historical record
of the early days of computerised map production, but also to act as a
repository of 'prior art', and known algorithms.

For extensive information see the [HTML documentation](index.html).

The earliest code is from 1976. The VMS development started in April 1980, 
with public releases 1985 through to 2002. This repository contains a
cleaned up version of the state of the code when development finished.
Earlier code is recovered from renamed versions of the code with no
guarantees of the state of it.

This includes source code. manuals, release notes and marketing brochures.
