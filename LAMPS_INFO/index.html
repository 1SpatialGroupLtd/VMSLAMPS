<H1>VMS LAMPS Digital Mapping Software - Sources and Documentation</H1>

<H2>What is/was LAMPS?</H2>
Laser-Scan (LSL) was a British technology company based in Cambridge, England, founded in 1969,
which produced world-leading graphics hardware and software for computer graphics, digital mapping, charting, and geographic information handling.
<P>
This page concerns the Laser-Scan suite of digital mapping software, called LAMPS (The Laser-Scan Automated Map Production System), which used the IFF
file format to store geographic and map data.
LAMPS was written between 1976 and 1995, and ran mainly on DEC VAX and Alpha computers under the VMS (later OpenVMS) operating system,
with early prototypes running on DEC PDP-11 hardware under RSX-11M.

<H2>What is here about LAMPS?</H2>
This page is the starting point to the human-readable source code, build/test files, and documentation of the VMS LAMPS digital mapping software suite.
They were extracted en-mass from the original Laser-Scan VMS systems by Paul Hardy aided by 1Spatial staff in 2016-2017.
<P>
They were then disentangled and separated from binary and customer files by Paul Hardy during 2018-2020.
The aim of this task was to allow them to be preserved for posterity, both as a historical record of the early days of computerised map production,
but also to act as a repository of 'prior art', and known algorithms. See below for indexes of both the source code, and of the documentation source files.
<P>
As a separate step to aid in understanding of LAMPS, the LAMPS printable manuals were regenerated from the documentation sources for each package, and converted to modern PDF format.
An index to those is also included below.
<P>
As background, and to help understanding of the sources, there are also indexes to a set of LAMPS brochures, and a collection of screenshots and other images related to LAMPS.

<H2>What Software Packages are Included?</H2>
The LAMPS software was always grouped into a set of 'Packages', covering a major aspect of functionality. Some packages were customer-specific, and are not included here.
Others are not included because they were rather esoteric and not very relevant.
However the following LAMPS common application packages and support packages are included:
<UL>
<LI>
The Laser-Scan system software support package (LSLSYSTEM) is required by all LSL software components. It includes environment setup command files,
supplementary system utilities, and utility programs needed by more than one package.
<LI>
The Laser-Scan mapping kernel Software package (MAPPING) is required by all other LAMPS software components. It includes the IFF file interface library
(IFFLIB), the Feature Representation library (FRTLIB), as well as various central LAMPS initialisation and control procedures.
<LI>
Laser-Scan maintenance utilities package (LSLMAINT) includes various utilities and libraries needed by LSL for maintenance and development of
software on-site.
<LI>
Laser-Scan internal utilities package (LSLINTERNAL) includes various utilities and libraries needed by LSL for original software development.
This is not usually included at customer sites, but is needed to support the LAMPS build environment.
<LI>
The IFF Map Processing package (IMP) is a central component, and allows creation, sorting, clipping, transformation, selection, combination, listing,
etc of IFF files.
<LI>
The cartographic editor and display package (LITES2) is the principal interactive graphical component. This allows map display, manual interactive digitising, correction
of operator errors following automated or blind digitising, and map update. LITES2 is available to run on a variety of graphics hardware, using various
interaction peripherals.
<LI>
The Fast Plotter Program FPP package (PLOTTING) will usually be part of a LAMPS system to allow plotting of IFF data to cartographic quality. FPP is
available to run on a variety of graphics hardware.
<LI>
The IFF data conversion package (CONVERT) is an optional component which allows conversion of IFF data to and from a variety of standard external
formats. Note that this package is divided into modules for different formats, so that only relevant modules need be supplied.
<LI>
The DFAD data support package (DFAD) is an optional component for support of Digital Feature Analysis Data, a common military attribute format.
<LI>
The flowline Control package (FLOWLINE) is an optional component which allows control of the tasks and data involved in managing a production flowline.
It uses the DEC Rdb relational database to store flowline and status information.
<LI>
The structured IFF data package (STRUCTURE) is an optional component which allows the creation and manipulation of link-node structured (junction) IFF
data files. The ILINK program which is a major element of this package will do extensive geometric "tidies" on vector data, eg extension, truncation,
common alignment, etc.
<LI>
The polygon IFF data package (POLYGONS) is an optional component which allows the creation and manipulation of Polygon (area) IFF features. The STRUCTURE
package is needed as a prerequisite.
<LI>
The laser line follower package (LASERAID) is an optional component allowing use of a Lasertrak or Fastrak laser technology line-following
digitising device for capture of geographic information from existing maps by automated digitising methods.
<LI>
The postprocessing support package (POSTPROCESS) is an optional component for finalising geographic datasets captured using the LASERAID package.
<LI>
The digitising table support package (TABLE) is an optional component allowing use of digitising tables for capture of geographic information from existing maps
by manual digitising methods.
<LI>
The matrix data kernel package (MATRIX) is required by all LAMPS matrix data handling software components below.
It includes the DTI file interface library, and basic matrix viewing and manipulation utilities.
<LI>
The terrain model creation package (DTMCREATE) is an optional component which allows generation of Digital Terrain Model matrices (DTMs) from vector
topographic data (eg contours and spot heights) by triangulation and interpolation.
<LI>
The DTM preparation package (DTMPREPARE) is an optional extension to package DTMCREATE which allows checking and analysis of vector data to be used as input
to terrain model generation. An example is the automated calculation of heights of river networks by intersection of rivers with contours.
<LI>
The DTM conversion package (DTMCONVERT) is an optional component which allows conversion of DTI matrix data to and from a variety of standard external
formats. Note that this package is divided into modules for different formats, and only relevant modules need be supplied.
<LI>
The terrain validation and exploitation package (TVES) is an optional component which allows display, analysis, and exploitation
of DTM matrix data.
<LI>
The image processing package (IMAGEPROCESS) is an optional component which provides conversion to DTI file of remotely sensed (eg satellite imagery)
data from external formats
</UL>

<H2>Source Index</H2>
The source files of LAMPS are provided in a directory tree under LAMPS_SRC, grouped by package, then by component, then in subfolders for SRC and BUILD etc.
For example, in package CONVERT is component CEDD2I, with BUILD, DATA and SRC subfolders, and in SRC is CEDD2I.SRC which is the main program of this hydrographic data convertion tool.
<P>
An automatically generated index to all the LAMPS source and build/test files is in <A HREF="lamps_source_index.html">lamps_source_index.html</A>

<H2>Documentation Index</H2>
The documentation source files of LAMPS are provided in a directory tree under LAMPS_DOC, grouped by package, then by volume name.
For example, in package CONVERT is volume REFERENCE, containing CEDD_CEDD2I.RNO which describes this hydrographic data convertion tool.
<P>
An automatically generated index to all the LAMPS documentation files is in <A HREF="lamps_doc_index.html">lamps_doc_index.html</A>

<H2>Manuals Index</H2>
To ease reading of the LAMPS documentation on modern computers, the printable manuals have been regenerated from the sources as LNI files using RUNOFF,
and these then converted to PDF files using a python script.
<P>
The resultant manuals of LAMPS are provided in a directory tree under LAMPS_MANUALS, grouped by package, then by volume name.
For example, in package CONVERT is volume REFERENCE, containing IFFCEDD.PDF which describes the tools for this hydrographic data format.
